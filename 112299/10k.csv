Management and representatives of Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) also may from time to time make forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements do not relate strictly to historical or current facts and reflect management’s assumptions, views, plans, objectives and projections about the future. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as “plans,” “expects,” “will,” “anticipates,” “estimates” and other words of similar meaning in conjunction with, among other things: discussions of future operations; expected operating results and financial performance; impact of planned acquisitions and dispositions; impact and timing of restructuring initiatives, including associated cost savings and other benefits; the planned separation of the Company’s Consumer Health business; the Company’s strategy for growth; product development activities; regulatory approvals; market position and expenditures. Because forward-looking statements are based on current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding future events, they are subject to uncertainties, risks and changes that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of the Company’s control. Investors should realize that if underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, or known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, the Company’s actual results and financial condition could vary materially from expectations and projections expressed or implied in its forward-looking statements. Investors are therefore cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements. Risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: Risks Related to Product Development, Market Success and Competition • Challenges and uncertainties inherent in innovation and development of new and improved products and technologies on which the Company’s continued growth and success depend, including uncertainty of clinical outcomes, additional analysis of existing clinical data, obtaining regulatory approvals, health plan coverage and customer access, and initial and continued commercial success; • Challenges to the Company’s ability to obtain and protect adequate patent and other intellectual property rights for new and existing products and technologies in the United States and other important markets; • The impact of patent expirations, typically followed by the introduction of competing generic, biosimilar or other products and resulting revenue and market share losses; • Increasingly aggressive and frequent challenges to the Company’s patents by competitors and others seeking to launch competing generic, biosimilar or other products and increased receptivity of courts, the United States Patent and Trademark Office and other decision makers to such challenges, potentially resulting in loss of market exclusivity and rapid decline in sales for the relevant product sooner than expected; • Competition in research and development of new and improved products, processes and technologies, which can result in product and process obsolescence; • Competition to reach agreement with third parties for collaboration, licensing, development and marketing agreements for products and technologies; • Competition based on cost-effectiveness, product performance, technological advances and patents attained by competitors; and • Allegations that the Company’s products infringe the patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties, which could adversely affect the Company’s ability to sell the products in question and require the payment of money damages and future royalties. Risks Related to Product Liability, Litigation and Regulatory Activity • Product efficacy or safety concerns, whether or not based on scientific evidence, potentially resulting in product withdrawals, recalls, regulatory action on the part of the United States Food and Drug Administration (or international counterparts), declining sales, reputational damage, increased litigation expense and share price impact; • The impact, including declining sales and reputational damage, of significant litigation or government action adverse to the Company, including product liability claims and allegations related to pharmaceutical marketing practices and contracting strategies; • The impact of an adverse judgment or settlement and the adequacy of reserves related to legal proceedings, including patent litigation, product liability, personal injury claims, securities class actions, government investigations, employment and other legal proceedings; • Increased scrutiny of the healthcare industry by government agencies and state attorneys general resulting in investigations and prosecutions, which carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties, including, but not limited to, debarment from government business; • Failure to meet compliance obligations in compliance agreements with governments or government agencies, which could result in significant sanctions; • Potential changes to applicable laws and regulations affecting United States and international operations, including relating to: approval of new products; licensing and patent rights; sales and promotion of healthcare products; access to, and reimbursement and pricing for, healthcare products and services; environmental protection; and sourcing of raw materials; • Compliance with local regulations and laws that may restrict the Company’s ability to manufacture or sell its products in relevant markets, including requirements to comply with medical device reporting regulations and other requirements such as the European Union’s Medical Devices Regulation; • Changes in domestic and international tax laws and regulations, increasing audit scrutiny by tax authorities around the world and exposures to additional tax liabilities potentially in excess of existing reserves; and • The issuance of new or revised accounting standards by the Financial Accounting Standards Board and regulations by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Risks Related to the Company’s Strategic Initiatives, Healthcare Market Trends and the Planned Separation of the Company’s Consumer Health Business • Pricing pressures resulting from trends toward healthcare cost containment, including the continued consolidation among healthcare providers and other market participants, trends toward managed care, the shift toward governments increasingly becoming the primary payers of healthcare expenses, significant new entrants to the healthcare markets seeking to reduce costs and government pressure on companies to voluntarily reduce costs and price increases; • Restricted spending patterns of individual, institutional and governmental purchasers of healthcare products and services due to economic hardship and budgetary constraints; • Challenges to the Company’s ability to realize its strategy for growth including through externally sourced innovations, such as development collaborations, strategic acquisitions, licensing and marketing agreements, and the potential heightened costs of any such external arrangements due to competitive pressures; • The potential that the expected strategic benefits and opportunities from any planned or completed acquisition or divestiture by the Company may not be realized or may take longer to realize than expected; • The potential that the expected benefits and opportunities related to past and ongoing restructuring actions may not be realized or may take longer to realize than expected; • The Company’s ability to consummate the planned separation of the Company’s Consumer Health business on a timely basis or at all; • The Company’s ability to successfully separate the Company’s Consumer Health business and realize the anticipated benefits from the planned separation; and • The New Consumer Health Company’s ability to succeed as a standalone publicly traded company. Risks Related to Economic Conditions, Financial Markets and Operating Internationally • The risks associated with global operations on the Company and its customers and suppliers, including foreign governments in countries in which the Company operates; • The impact of inflation and fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates and the potential effect of such fluctuations on revenues, expenses and resulting margins; • Potential changes in export/import and trade laws, regulations and policies of the United States and other countries, including any increased trade restrictions or tariffs and potential drug reimportation legislation; • The impact on international operations from financial instability in international economies, sovereign risk, possible imposition of governmental controls and restrictive economic policies, and unstable international governments and legal systems; • The impact of global public health crises and pandemics, including the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic; • Changes to global climate, extreme weather and natural disasters that could affect demand for the Company’s products and services, cause disruptions in manufacturing and distribution networks, alter the availability of goods and services within the supply chain, and affect the overall design and integrity of the Company’s products and operations; and • The impact of armed conflicts and terrorist attacks in the United States and other parts of the world, including social and economic disruptions and instability of financial and other markets. Risks Related to Supply Chain and Operations • Difficulties and delays in manufacturing, internally, through third-party providers or otherwise within the supply chain, that may lead to voluntary or involuntary business interruptions or shutdowns, product shortages, withdrawals or suspensions of products from the market, and potential regulatory action; • Interruptions and breaches of the Company’s information technology systems or those of the Company’s vendors, which could result in reputational, competitive, operational or other business harm as well as financial costs and regulatory action; • Reliance on global supply chains and production and distribution processes that are complex and subject to increasing regulatory requirements that may adversely affect supply, sourcing and pricing of materials used in the Company’s products; and • The potential that the expected benefits and opportunities related to restructuring actions contemplated for the global supply chain may not be realized or may take longer to realize than expected, including due to any required approvals from applicable regulatory authorities. Investors also should carefully read the Risk Factors described in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of certain risks that could, among other things, cause the Company’s actual results to differ materially from those expressed in its forward-looking statements. Investors should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and should not consider the risks described above and in Item 1A to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. The Company does not undertake to publicly update any forward-looking statement that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information or future events or developments. PART I Item 1. BUSINESS General Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 152,700 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the healthcare field. Johnson & Johnson is a holding company, with operating companies conducting business in virtually all countries of the world. The Company’s primary focus is products related to human health and well-being. Johnson & Johnson was incorporated in the State of New Jersey in 1887. The Executive Committee of Johnson & Johnson is the principal management group responsible for the strategic operations and allocation of the resources of the Company. This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities of the Company's three business segments: Consumer Health, Pharmaceutical and MedTech (previously referred to as Medical Devices). Within the strategic parameters provided by the Committee, senior management groups at U.S. and international operating companies are each responsible for their own strategic plans and the day-to-day operations of those companies. Each subsidiary within the business segments is, with limited exceptions, managed by residents of the country where located. Segments of Business The Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer Health, Pharmaceutical and MedTech. Additional information required by this item is incorporated herein by reference to the narrative and tabular descriptions of segments and operating results under: “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition” of this Report; and Note 17 “Segments of Business and Geographic Areas” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Consumer Health The Consumer Health segment includes a broad range of products focused on personal healthcare used in the Skin Health/Beauty, Over-the-Counter medicines, Baby Care, Oral Care, Women’s Health and Wound Care markets.

Medicines in this segment are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers, distributors, hospitals and healthcare professionals for prescription use. Key products in the Pharmaceutical segment include: REMICADE (infliximab), a treatment for a number of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases; SIMPONI (golimumab), a subcutaneous treatment for adults with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis, active psoriatic arthritis, active ankylosing spondylitis and moderately active to severely active ulcerative colitis; SIMPONI ARIA (golimumab), an intravenous treatment for adults with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis, active psoriatic arthritis and active ankylosing spondylitis and active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA) in people 2 years of age and older; STELARA (ustekinumab), a treatment for adults and children with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, for adults with active psoriatic arthritis, for adults with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease and treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis; TREMFYA (guselkumab), a treatment for adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and active psoriatic arthritis; EDURANT (rilpivirine), PREZISTA (darunavir) and PREZCOBIX/REZOLSTA (darunavir/cobicistat), antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) in combination with other antiretroviral products and SYMTUZA (darunavir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide), a once-daily single tablet regimen for the treatment of HIV; CONCERTA (methylphenidate HCl) extended-release tablets CII, a treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; INVEGA SUSTENNA/XEPLION (paliperidone palmitate), for the treatment of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder in adults; INVEGA TRINZA/TREVICTA (paliperidone palmitate), for the treatment of schizophrenia in patients after they have been adequately treated with INVEGA SUSTENNA for at least four months; RISPERDAL CONSTA (risperidone long-acting injection), for the treatment of schizophrenia and the maintenance treatment of Bipolar 1 Disorder in adults; ZYTIGA 1 (abiraterone acetate), a treatment for patients with prostate cancer; ERLEADA (apalutamide), a next-generation androgen receptor inhibitor for the treatment of patients with prostate cancer; IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib), a treatment for certain B-cell malignancies, or blood cancers and chronic graft versus host disease; DARZALEX (daratumumab), a treatment for multiple myeloma; DARZALEX FASPRO (daratumumab and hyaluronidase-fihj), a treatment for multiple myeloma and light chain (AL) Amyloidosis; XARELTO (rivaroxaban), an oral anticoagulant for the prevention of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which may lead to pulmonary embolism (PE) in patients undergoing hip or knee replacement surgery, to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, and for the treatment and reduction of risk of recurrence of DVT and PE to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and peripheral artery disease (PAD), for the treatment and secondary prevention of thromboembolism in pediatric patients, and for thromboprophylaxis in pediatric patients following the Fontan procedure; INVOKANA (canagliflozin), for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes; INVOKAMET/VOKANAMET (canagliflozin/metformin HCl), a combination therapy of fixed doses of canagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes; and INVOKAMET XR (canagliflozin/metformin hydrochloride extended-release), a once-daily, fixed-dose combination therapy of canagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release, for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes; OPSUMIT (macitentan) as monotherapy or in combination, indicated for the long-term treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH); UPTRAVI (selexipag), the only approved oral and intravenous, selective IP receptor agonist targeting a prostacyclin pathway in PAH. Many of these medicines were developed in collaboration with strategic partners or are licensed from other companies and maintain active lifecycle development programs. MedTech The MedTech (previously referred to as Medical Devices) segment includes a broad portfolio of products used in the Interventional Solutions, Orthopaedics, Surgery and Vision categories. Interventional Solutions include Electrophysiology products (Biosense Webster) to treat cardiovascular diseases, Neurovascular care (Cerenovus) that treats hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke and the Heart Recovery portfolio (Abiomed) which includes technologies to treat severe coronary artery disease requiring high-risk PCI or AMI cardiogenic shock. The Orthopaedics portfolio (DePuy Synthes) comprises products in support of Hips, Knees, Trauma, and Spine, Sports & Other. The Surgery portfolios include advanced and general surgery offerings (Ethicon), solutions that focus on Breast Aesthetics (Mentor), and Ear, Nose and Throat (Acclarent) procedures. Johnson & Johnson Vision products include ACUVUE Brand contact lenses and ophthalmic technologies related to cataract and laser refractive surgery. These products are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used predominantly in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics. Geographic Areas Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 152,700 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the healthcare field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world with the primary focus on products related to human health and well-being. The products made and sold in the international business include many of those described above under “– Segments of Business – Consumer Health,” “– Pharmaceutical” and “– MedTech.” However, the principal markets, products and methods of distribution in the international business vary with the country and the culture. The products sold in international business include those developed in the U.S. and by subsidiaries abroad. Investments and activities in some countries outside the U.S. are subject to higher risks than comparable U.S. activities because the investment and commercial climate may be influenced by financial instability in international economies, restrictive economic policies and political and legal system uncertainties. Raw Materials Raw materials essential to the Company's business are generally readily available from multiple sources. Where there are exceptions, the temporary unavailability of those raw materials would not likely have a material adverse effect on the financial results of the Company. Patents The Company's subsidiaries have made a practice of obtaining patent protection on their products and processes where possible. They own, or are licensed under, a significant number of patents in the U.S. and other countries relating to their products, product uses, formulations and manufacturing processes, which in the aggregate are believed to be of material importance to the Company in the operation of its businesses. The Company’s subsidiaries face patent challenges from third parties, including challenges seeking to manufacture and market generic and biosimilar versions of the Company's key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. Significant legal proceedings and claims involving the Company's patent and other intellectual property are described in Note 19, “Legal Proceedings— Intellectual Property” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Sales of the Company’s largest product, STELARA (ustekinumab), accounted for approximately 10.2% of the Company's total revenues for fiscal 2022. Accordingly, the patents related to this product are believed to be material to the 2 Company. Janssen Biotech, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, owns patents specifically related to STELARA . The latest expiring United States composition of matter patent expires in 2023. The latest expiring European composition of matter patent expires in 2024. Sales of the Company’s second largest product, collectively DARZALEX (daratumumab) and DARZALEX FASPRO (daratumumab and hyaluronidase-fihj), accounted for approximately 8.4% of the Company's total revenues for fiscal 2022. Accordingly, the patents related to this product are believed to be material to the Company. Genmab A/S owns two patent families related to DARZALEX, and Janssen Biotech, Inc. has an exclusive license to those patent families. The two patent families both expire in the United States in 2029. The latest expiring licensed European patent expires in 2032. Janssen Biotech, Inc. owns a separate patent portfolio related to DARZALEX FASPRO. Trademarks The Company’s subsidiaries have made a practice of selling their products under trademarks and of obtaining protection for these trademarks by all available means. These trademarks are protected by registration in the U.S. and other countries where such products are marketed. The Company considers these trademarks in the aggregate to be of material importance in the operation of its businesses. Seasonality Worldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality; however, spending has typically been heavier in the fourth quarter of each year than in other quarters. This reflects increased spending decisions, principally for advertising and research and development activity. Competition In all of their product lines, the Company's subsidiaries compete with companies both locally and globally. Competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved. Competition in research, both internally and externally sourced, involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. The development of new and innovative products, as well as protecting the underlying intellectual property of the Company’s product portfolio, is important to the Company's success in all areas of its business. The competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research. In addition, the development and maintenance of customer demand for the Company’s consumer products involve significant expenditures for advertising and promotion. Environment The Company is subject to a variety of U.S. and international environmental protection measures. The Company believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations. The Company’s compliance with these requirements is not expected to have a material effect upon its capital expenditures, cash flows, earnings or competitive position. Regulation The Company’s businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which operations are conducted, and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation and enforcement. The Company is subject to costly and complex U.S. and foreign laws and governmental regulations and any adverse regulatory action may materially adversely affect the Company's financial condition and business operations. In the U.S., the drug, device and cosmetic industries have long been subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies, primarily as to product safety, efficacy, manufacturing, advertising, labeling and safety reporting. The exercise of broad regulatory powers by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the U.S. FDA) continues to result in increases in the amounts of testing and documentation required for U.S. FDA approval of new drugs and devices and a corresponding increase in the expense of product introduction. Similar trends are also evident in major markets outside of the U.S. The new medical device regulatory framework and the evolving privacy, data localization, and emerging cyber security laws and regulations around the world are examples of such increased regulation. Five U.S. States (California, Connecticut, Colorado, Utah and Virginia) now have comprehensive privacy laws in place and China introduced broad personal information protection and data security regulations in 2022. With other jurisdictions enacting similar privacy laws, local data protection authorities will force greater accountability on the collection, access and use of personal data in the healthcare industry. The regulatory agencies under whose purview the Company operates have administrative powers that may subject it to actions such as product withdrawals, recalls, seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions. In some cases, the Company’s subsidiaries may deem it advisable to initiate product recalls regardless of whether it has been required or directed to. The U.S. FDA and regulatory agencies around the globe are also increasing their enforcement activities. If the U.S. FDA were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our drugs or medical 3 devices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, the U.S. FDA could ban such products, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded products, order a recall, repair, replacement, or refund of such products, refuse to grant pending applications for marketing authorization or require certificates of foreign governments for exports, and/or require us to notify health professionals and others that the products present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The U.S. FDA may also assess civil or criminal penalties against us, our officers or employees and impose operating restrictions on a company-wide basis, or enjoin and/or restrain certain conduct resulting in violations of applicable law. The U.S. FDA may also recommend prosecution to the U.S. Department of Justice. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict us from effectively marketing and selling our products and limit our ability to obtain future clearances or approvals, and could result in a substantial modification to our business practices and operations. Equivalent enforcement mechanisms exist in different countries in which we conduct business. The costs of human healthcare have been and continue to be a subject of study, investigation and regulation by governmental agencies and legislative bodies around the world. In the U.S., attention has been focused by states, regulatory agencies and Congress on prices, profits, overutilization and the quality and costs of healthcare generally. Laws and regulations have been enacted to require adherence to strict compliance standards and prevent fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. There is increased focus on interactions and financial relationships between healthcare companies and healthcare providers. Various transparency laws and regulations require disclosures of payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals and, beginning with disclosures in 2022, to certain non-physician practitioners. Federal and foreign laws governing international business practices require strict compliance with anti-bribery standards and certain prohibitions with respect to payments to any foreign government official. Payers and Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) have become a more potent force in the market place and increased attention is being paid to drug pricing and appropriate drug and medical device utilization. Our business has been and continues to be affected by federal and state legislation that alters the pricing, coverage, and reimbursement landscape. At the federal level, in August 2022, President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which includes provisions that effectively authorize the government to establish prices for certain high-spend single-source drugs and biologics reimbursed by the Medicare program, starting in 2026 for Medicare Part D drugs and 2028 for Medicare Part B drugs. It is not yet certain which products the federal government will select and subject to government-established prices, or how the federal government will establish prices for selected products, as the IRA specifies a ceiling price but not a minimum price. One or more of our products could be selected and subject to the government-established price. The IRA also contains provisions that impose rebates if certain prices increase at a rate that outpaces the rate of inflation, beginning October 1, 2022, for Medicare Part D drugs and January 1, 2023, for Medicare Part B drugs. Separate IRA provisions redesign the Medicare Part D benefit in various ways, including by shifting a greater portion of costs to manufacturers within certain coverage phases and replacing the Part D coverage gap discount program with a new manufacturer discounting program. Failure to comply with IRA provisions may subject manufacturers to various penalties, including civil monetary penalties. The impact of the IRA on our business and the broader pharmaceutical industry remains uncertain, as the federal government has yet to make various IRA implementation decisions. Additionally, we expect continued scrutiny on drug pricing and government price reporting from Congress, agencies, and other bodies at the federal and state levels. There are a number of additional bills pending in Congress and healthcare reform proposals at the state level that would affect drug pricing, including in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This changing legal landscape has both positive and negative impacts on the U.S. healthcare industry with much remaining uncertain as to how various provisions of federal and state law, and potential modification or repeal of these laws, will ultimately affect the industry. The IRA and any other federal or state legislative change could affect the pricing and market conditions for our products. In addition, business practices in the healthcare industry have come under increased scrutiny, particularly in the U.S., by government agencies and state attorneys general, and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties. Of note is the increased enforcement activity by data protection authorities in various jurisdictions, particularly in the European Union, where significant fines have been levied on companies for data breaches, violations of privacy requirements, and unlawful cross-border data transfers. In the U.S., the Federal Trade Commission has stepped up enforcement of data privacy with several significant settlements and there have been a material increase in class-action lawsuits linked to the collection and use of biometric data. Further, the Company relies on global supply chains, and production and distribution processes, that are complex, are subject to increasing regulatory requirements, and may be faced with unexpected changes such as those resulting from the 4 COVID-19 pandemic and Brexit that may affect sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in the Company's products. These processes also are subject to complex and lengthy regulatory approvals. Employees and Human Capital Management As of January 1, 2023, and January 2, 2022, the number of employees were approximately: 2022 2021 Employees 1 155,800 144,300 Full-time equivalent (FTE) positions 2 152,700 141,700 1 “Employee” is defined as an individual working full-time or part-time, excluding fixed term employees, interns and co-op employees. Employee data may not include full population from more recently acquired companies and individuals on long-term disability are excluded. Contingent workers, contractors and subcontractors are also excluded. Abiomed headcount has been included in the above table. 2 FTE represents the total number of full-time equivalent positions and does not reflect the total number of individual employees as some work part-time. Strategy The Company believes that its employees are critical to its continued success and are an essential element of its long-term strategy. Management is responsible for ensuring that its policies and processes reflect and reinforce the Company's desired corporate culture, including policies and processes related to strategy, risk management, and ethics and compliance. The Company’s human capital management strategy is built on three fundamental focus areas: • Attracting and recruiting the best talent • Developing and retaining talent • Empowering and inspiring talent Underpinning these focus areas are ongoing efforts to cultivate and foster a culture built on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), innovation, health, well-being and safety, where the Company's employees are encouraged to succeed both professionally and personally while helping the Company achieve its business goals. Culture and Employee Engagement At the Company, employees are guided by Our Credo which sets forth the Company's responsibilities to patients, consumers, customers, healthcare professionals, employees, communities and shareholders. Employees worldwide must adhere to the Company’s Code of Business Conduct which sets basic requirements and serves as a foundation for the Company policies, procedures and guidelines, all of which provide additional guidance on expected employee behaviors in every market where it operates. The Company c onducts global surveys that offer its employees the ability to provide feedback and valuable insight to help address potential human resources risks and identify opportunities to improve. In 2022, 92% of global employees across 77 countries participated in Our Credo Survey which was offered in 36 languages . 5 Growth and Development To continue to lead in the changing healthcare landscape, it is crucial that the Company continue to attract and retain top talent. The Company believes that its employees must be equipped with the right knowledge and skills and be provided with opportunities to grow and develop in their careers. Accordingly, professional development programs and educational resources are available to all employees. The Company's objective is to foster a learning culture that helps shape each person’s unique career path while creating a robust pipeline of talent to deliver on the Company’s long-term strategies. In furtherance of this objective, the Company deploys a global approach to ensure development is for everyone, regardless of where they are on their career journey. In 2022, 46.2% of employees in Manager and above job categories who had movements (including upward promotions or lateral transfers) took advantage of career opportunities by moving across functions, country or business segment lines (excluding employees in the research and development organizations). The Company's voluntary turnover rate was 9%. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) The Company is committed to workplace diversity and to cultivating, fostering, and advancing a culture of equity and inclusion. In 2022, Johnson & Johnson introduced the Company’s evolved enterprise Diversity, Equity and Inclusion strategy, which recognizes how DEI accelerates the Company’s ability to meet the changing needs of the communities the Company serves to deliver Our Purpose to profoundly change the trajectory of health for humanity. The Company’s DEI vision is: Be yourself, change the world. The Company’s DEI Mission is: Make diversity, equity and inclusion how we work everyday . Our evolved enterprise DEI Strategy is aligned to our DEI Vision and Mission and rests on four core pillars: • Accelerate our global culture of inclusion where every individual belongs • Build a workforce that reflects the diversity of our communities • Transform talent and business processes to achieve equitable access and outcomes for all • Drive innovation and growth with our business to serve diverse markets around the world The Company’s DEI strategy is guided by internal and external insights, global best practices and continual employee feedback which remind the Company that while diversity changes by location, inclusion is the same everywhere. Compensation and Benefits As part of the Company's total rewards philosophy, the Company offers competitive compensation and benefits to attract and retain top talent. The Company is committed to fairness and equitable treatment in its compensation and benefits for employees at all levels. The Company observes legal minimum wage provisions and exceeds them where possible. The Company's total rewards offerings include an array of programs to support its employees' well-being, including annual performance incentive opportunities, pension and retirement savings programs, health and welfare benefits, paid time off, leave programs, flexible work schedules and employee assistance programs. In recognition of the Company’s commitment to help employees balance their personal and professional responsibilities, the Company extended its paid parental leave benefit globally from 8 to 12 weeks for all eligible employees. In the U.S., the benefit was effective on January 1, 2022, with retroactive coverage for new family additions as of July 1, 2021. Health, Wellness and Safety The Company’s investment in employee health, well-being and safety is built on its conviction that advancing health for humanity starts with advancing the health of its employees. With the right awareness, focus, practices and tools, the Company ensures that all its employees around the world, as well as temporary contractors and visitors to the Company's sites, can work safely. The Company has continuously expanded health and well-being programs throughout the Company and across the globe, incorporating new thinking and technologies to keep its offerings best-in-class and to help employees achieve their personal health goals. The programs and practices the Company advances for total health—physical, mental, emotional and financial—ensure employee health protection for emerging health risks. Protecting and supporting our employees as the COVID-19 pandemic has evolved continues to be a top priority and the Company’s approach includes: ensuring the health and safety of our employees in the workplace through robust layers of protection; enhanced cleaning and access to cleaning supplies and personal protective equipment; supporting employees with benefits and well-being tools. The Company continues to address our employees needs through J&J Flex, a hybrid model that empowers the Company’s office-based employees to find the right productivity and balance of in-person and remote work. 6 Available Information The Company’s main corporate website address is www.jnj.com .

RISK FACTORS An investment in the Company’s common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties. The Company seeks to identify, manage and mitigate risks to our business, but uncertainties and risks are difficult to predict and many are outside of the Company’s control and cannot therefore be eliminated. In addition to the other information in this report and the Company’s other filings with the SEC, investors should consider carefully the factors set forth below. Investors should be aware that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and that the following is not meant to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties. If known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, the Company’s business, results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected, potentially in a material way. Risks Related to Our Business, Industry and Operations The Company’s businesses operate in highly competitive product markets and competitive pressures could adversely affect the Company’s earnings. The Company faces substantial competition in all three operating segments and in all geographic markets. The Company’s businesses compete with companies of all sizes on the basis of cost-effectiveness, technological innovations, intellectual property rights, product performance, real or perceived product advantages, pricing and availability and rate of reimbursement. The Company also competes with other market participants in securing rights to acquisitions, collaborations and licensing agreements with third parties. Competition for rights to product candidates and technologies may result in significant investment and acquisition costs and onerous agreement terms for the Company. Competitors’ development of more effective or less costly products, and/or their ability to secure patent and other intellectual property rights and successfully market products ahead of the Company, could negatively impact sales of the Company’s existing products as well as its ability to bring new products to market despite significant prior investment in the related product development. For the Company’s Pharmaceutical businesses, loss of patent exclusivity for a product often is followed by a substantial reduction in sales as competitors gain regulatory approval for generic and other competing products and enter the market. Similar competition can be triggered by the loss of exclusivity for a biological product. For the Company’s MedTech businesses, technological innovation, product quality, reputation and customer service are especially important to competitiveness. Development by other companies of new or improved products, processes and technologies could threaten to make the Company’s products or technologies less desirable, less economical or obsolete. The Company’s Consumer Health businesses face intense competition from other branded products and retailers’ private-label brands. If the Company fails to sufficiently differentiate and market its brand name consumer products, this could adversely affect revenues and profitability of those products. Interruptions and delays in manufacturing operations could adversely affect the Company’s business, sales and reputation. The Company’s manufacture of products requires the timely delivery of sufficient amounts of complex, high-quality components and materials. The Company’s subsidiaries operate 89 manufacturing facilities as well as sourcing from thousands of suppliers around the world. The Company has in the past, and may in the future, face unanticipated interruptions and delays in manufacturing through its internal or external supply chain. Manufacturing disruptions can occur for many reasons including regulatory action, production quality deviations or safety issues, labor disputes, labor shortages, site-specific incidents (such as fires), natural disasters such as hurricanes and other severe weather events, raw material shortages, political unrest, terrorist attacks and epidemics or pandemics. Such delays and difficulties in manufacturing can result in product shortages, declines in sales and reputational impact as well as significant remediation and related costs associated with addressing the shortage. The Company relies on third parties to manufacture certain of our products. Any failure by or loss of a third-party manufacturer could result in delays and increased costs, which may adversely affect our business. The Company relies on third parties to manufacture certain of our products. We depend on these third-party manufacturers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis and at acceptable prices. However, we cannot guarantee that these third-party manufacturers will be able to meet our near-term or long-term manufacturing requirements, which could result in lost sales and have an adverse effect on our business. Other risks associated with our reliance on third parties to manufacture these products include reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance, misappropriation of the Company’s intellectual property, limited ability to manage our inventory, possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party and the possible termination or nonrenewal of the manufacturing agreement by the third party at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us. Moreover, if any of our third-party manufacturers suffers any damage to facilities, loses benefits under material agreements, experiences power outages, encounters financial difficulties, is unable to secure necessary raw materials from its suppliers or suffers any other reduction in efficiency, the Company may experience significant business disruption. In the event of any such disruption, the 8 Company would need to seek and source other qualified third-party manufacturers, likely resulting in further delays and increased costs which could affect our business adversely. Counterfeit versions of our products could harm our patients and have a negative impact on our revenues, earnings, reputation and business. Our industry continues to be challenged by the vulnerability of distribution channels to illegal counterfeiting and the presence of counterfeit products in a growing number of markets and over the Internet. Third parties may illegally distribute and sell counterfeit versions of our products, which do not meet our rigorous manufacturing and testing standards. To distributors and patients, counterfeit products may be visually indistinguishable from the authentic version. Counterfeit medicines pose a risk to patient health and safety because of the conditions under which they are manufactured – often in unregulated, unlicensed, uninspected and unsanitary sites – as well as the lack of regulation of their contents. The industry’s failure to mitigate the threat of counterfeit medicines could adversely impact our business and reputation by impacting patient confidence in our authentic products, potentially resulting in lost sales, product recalls, and an increased threat of litigation. In addition, diversion of our products from their authorized market into other channels may result in reduced revenues and negatively affect our profitability. Global health crises, pandemics, epidemics, or other outbreaks could adversely disrupt or impact certain aspects of the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. We are subject to risks associated with global health crises, epidemics, pandemics and other outbreaks (such incident(s), a health crisis or health crises), including the global outbreak of coronavirus and its variants (COVID-19). The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, certain aspects of the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition, including lower sales and reduced customer demand and usage of certain of our products. The continued spread of COVID-19 or other health crises may cause the Company to modify its business practices, and take further actions as may be required by government authorities or as the Company determines are in the best interests of our patients, customers, employees and business partners. While the Company has robust business continuity plans in place across our global supply chain network to help mitigate the impact of health crises, these efforts may not completely prevent our business from being adversely affected and future impacts remain uncertain. While the U.S. and other countries have substantially reopened their economies, the extent to which COVID-19, or other health crises, could impact the Company’s future operations will depend on many factors which cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration of an outbreak and impact of variants. A surge in COVID-19 or other health crises could result in the imposition of new mandates and prolonged restrictive measures implemented in order to control the spread of disease. The global spread of COVID-19 or other health crises could adversely impact the Company’s operations, including, among other things, our manufacturing operations, supply chain, third-party suppliers, sales and marketing, and clinical trial operations. Any of these factors could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial results, and global economic conditions generally. We also face uncertainties related to our vaccine development programs, including uncertainties related to the risk that our continued development programs may not be successful, commercially viable or receive approval from regulatory authorities; risks associated with clinical trial and real-world data, including further analyses of its efficacy, safety and durability; the risk that continued evolution and mutation of disease and the duration of a particular outbreak may impede our ability to conduct trials within a specified time frame; the risk that data are subject to differing interpretations and assessments, including during the peer review/publication process, in the scientific community generally, and by national immunization technical advisory groups (NITAGs) and regulatory authorities; disruptions in the relationships between us, our third-party suppliers, external manufacturers, and other third parties with whom we engage; the risk that other companies may produce superior or competitive products; the risk that demand for any products we may develop may no longer exist; risks related to the availability of raw materials to manufacture any such products; the risk that we may not be able to recoup costs associated with our R&D and manufacturing efforts and risks associated with any changes in the way we approach or provide additional research funding for potential drug development; the risk that we may not be able to create or scale up manufacturing capacity on a timely basis, that we may continue to experience manufacturing delays once a manufacturing site is activated, or have access to logistics or supply channels commensurate with global demand for any potential approved vaccine or product candidate, which would negatively impact our ability to supply the estimated numbers of doses of our vaccine within the projected time periods indicated, and other challenges and risks associated with the pace of our vaccine development program; and pricing and access challenges for such products, including in the U.S. Risks Related to Government Regulation and Legal Proceedings Global sales in the Company’s Pharmaceutical and MedTech segments may be negatively impacted by healthcare reforms and increasing pricing pressures. 9 Sales of the Company’s Pharmaceutical and MedTech products are significantly affected by reimbursements by third-party payers such as government healthcare programs, private insurance plans and managed care organizations. As part of various efforts to contain healthcare costs, these payers are putting downward pressure on prices at which products will be reimbursed. In the U.S., increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of Medicare, Medicaid, and private sector beneficiaries, in part due to continued consolidation among healthcare providers, could result in further pricing pressures. In addition, recent legislation and ongoing political scrutiny or pricing, coverage and reimbursement could result in additional pricing pressures. Specifically, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) may subject certain products to government-established pricing, potentially impose rebates, and subject manufacturers who fail to adhere to the government's interpretations of the law to penalties. Outside the U.S., numerous major markets, including the EU, United Kingdom, Japan and China, have pervasive government involvement in funding healthcare and, in that regard, directly or indirectly impose price controls, limit access to, or reimbursement for, the Company’s products, or reduce the value of its intellectual property protection. The Company is subject to significant legal proceedings that can result in significant expenses, fines and reputational damage. In the ordinary course of business, Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims and lawsuits involving various issues such as product liability, patent disputes and claims that their product sales, marketing and pricing practices violate various antitrust, unfair trade practices and/or consumer protection laws. The Company’s more significant legal proceedings are described in Note 19, “Legal Proceedings” under Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Litigation, in general, and securities, derivative action, class action and multi-district litigation, in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. Some of these matters may include thousands of plaintiffs, may involve parties seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages, and may remain unresolved for several years. For example, the Company is a defendant in numerous lawsuits arising out of the use of body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S Baby Powder, and the Company’s sale, manufacturing and marketing of opioids. While the Company believes it has substantial defenses in these matters, it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation. The Company could in the future be required to pay significant amounts as a result of settlements or judgments in these matters, potentially in excess of accruals, including matters where the Company could be held jointly and severally liable among other defendants. The resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and cash flows for that period. The Company does not purchase third-party product liability insurance; however, the Company utilizes a wholly owned captive insurance company subject to certain limits. Product reliability, safety and effectiveness concerns can have significant negative impacts on sales and results of operations, lead to litigation and cause reputational damage. Concerns about product safety, whether raised internally or by litigants, regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence, can result in safety alerts, product recalls, governmental investigations, regulatory action on the part of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (or its counterpart in other countries), private claims and lawsuits, payment of fines and settlements, declining sales and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in the Company’s products. Product recalls have in the past, and could in the future, prompt government investigations and inspections, the shutdown of manufacturing facilities, continued product shortages and related sales declines, significant remediation costs, reputational damage, possible civil penalties and criminal prosecution. The Company faces significant regulatory scrutiny, which imposes significant compliance costs and exposes the Company to government investigations, legal actions and penalties. Like other companies in the healthcare industry, the Company is subject to extensive regulation, investigations and legal action by national, state and local government agencies in the U.S. and other countries in which it operates. Regulatory issues regarding compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) (and comparable quality regulations in foreign countries) by manufacturers of drugs, devices and consumer products can lead to fines and penalties, product recalls, product shortages, interruptions in production, delays in new product approvals and litigation. In addition, the marketing, pricing and sale of the Company’s products are subject to regulation, investigations and legal actions including under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Medicaid Rebate Program, federal and state false claims acts, state unfair trade practices acts and consumer protection laws. Scrutiny of healthcare industry business practices by government agencies and state attorneys general in the U.S., and any resulting investigations and prosecutions, carry risk of significant civil and criminal penalties including, but not limited to, debarment from participation in government healthcare programs. Any such debarment could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations. The most significant current investigations and litigation brought by government agencies are described in Note 19, “Legal Proceedings—Government Proceedings” under Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Changes in tax laws or exposures to additional tax liabilities could negatively impact the Company’s operating results. Changes in tax laws or regulations around the world, including in the U.S. and as led by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, such as the recent adoption by the EU, enactment by South Korea and the anticipated enactment 10 by additional countries of a global minimum tax, could negatively impact the Company’s effective tax rate and results of operations. A change in statutory tax rate or certain international tax provisions in any country would result in the revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the period in which the new tax law is enacted. This change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The Company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the countries where it operates. Changes to tax laws or regulations may occur at any time, and any related expense or benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted. See Note 8, “Income Taxes” under Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report for additional information. The Company conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and is addressing tax audits and disputes with many tax authorities. In connection with various government initiatives, companies are required to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in other countries. The Company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of its tax audits and disputes to determine the appropriateness of its tax reserves. However, any tax authority could take a position on tax treatment that is contrary to the Company’s expectations, which could result in tax liabilities in excess of reserves. Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property The Company faces increased challenges to intellectual property rights central to its business. The Company owns or licenses a significant number of patents and other proprietary rights relating to its products and manufacturing processes. These rights are essential to the Company’s businesses and materially important to the Company’s results of operations. Public policy, both within and outside the U.S., has become increasingly unfavorable toward intellectual property rights. The Company cannot be certain that it will obtain adequate patent protection for new products and technologies in the United States and other important markets or that such protections, once granted, will last as long as originally anticipated. Competitors routinely challenge the validity or extent of the Company’s owned or licensed patents and proprietary rights through litigation, interferences, oppositions and other proceedings, such as inter partes review (IPR) proceedings before the United States Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO). These proceedings absorb resources and can be protracted as well as unpredictable. In addition, challenges that the Company’s products infringe the patents of third parties could result in an injunction and/or the need to pay past damages and future royalties and adversely affect the competitive position and sales of the products in question. The Company has faced increasing patent challenges from third parties seeking to manufacture and market generic and biosimilar versions of the Company’s key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. In the U.S., manufacturers of generic versions of innovative human pharmaceutical products may challenge the validity, or claim non-infringement, of innovator products through the Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, process with the U.S. FDA and related ANDA litigation. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA), enacted in 2010, which created a new regulatory pathway for the approval by the U.S. FDA of biosimilar alternatives to innovator-developed biological products, also created mechanisms for biosimilar applicants to challenge the patents on the innovator biologics. The IPR process with the USPTO is also being used by competitors to challenge patents asserted in litigation. In the event the Company is not successful in defending its patents against such challenges, or upon the “at-risk” launch by the generic or biosimilar firm of its product, the Company can lose a major portion of revenues for the referenced product in a very short period of time. Current legal proceedings involving the Company’s patents and other intellectual property rights are described in Note 19, “Legal Proceedings—Intellectual Property” under Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Risks Related to Product Development, Regulatory Approval and Commercialization Significant challenges or delays in the Company’s innovation and development of new products, technologies and indications could have an adverse impact on the Company’s long-term success. The Company’s continued growth and success depends on its ability to innovate and develop new and differentiated products and services that address the evolving healthcare needs of patients, providers and consumers. Development of successful products and technologies is also necessary to offset revenue losses when the Company’s existing products lose market share due to various factors such as competition and loss of patent exclusivity. New products introduced within the past five years 11 accounted for approximately 25% of 2022 sales. The Company cannot be certain when or whether it will be able to develop, license or otherwise acquire companies, products and technologies, whether particular product candidates will be granted regulatory approval, and, if approved, whether the products will be commercially successful. The Company pursues product development through internal research and development as well as through collaborations, acquisitions, joint ventures and licensing or other arrangements with third parties. In all of these contexts, developing new products, particularly pharmaceutical and biotechnology products and medical devices, requires significant investment of resources over many years. Only a very few biopharmaceutical research and development programs result in commercially viable products. The process depends on many factors including the ability to: discern patients’ and healthcare providers’ future needs; develop promising new compounds, strategies and technologies; achieve successful clinical trial results; secure effective intellectual property protection; obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis; and, if and when they reach the market, successfully differentiate the Company’s products from competing products and approaches to treatment. New products or enhancements to existing products may not be accepted quickly or significantly in the marketplace due to product and price competition, changes in customer preferences or healthcare purchasing patterns, resistance by healthcare providers or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. Even following initial regulatory approval, the success of a product can be adversely impacted by safety and efficacy findings in larger real-world patient populations, as well as market entry of competitive products. Risks Related to Financial and Economic Market Conditions The Company faces a variety of financial, economic, legal, social and political risks associated with conducting business internationally . The Company’s extensive operations and business activity throughout the world are accompanied by certain financial, economic, legal, social and political risks, including those listed below. Foreign Currency Exchange : In fiscal 2022, approximately 49% of the Company’s sales occurred outside of the U.S., with approximately 25% in Europe, 6% in the Western Hemisphere, excluding the U.S., and 18% in the Asia-Pacific and Africa region. Changes in non-U.S. currencies relative to the U.S. dollar impact the Company’s revenues and expenses. While the Company uses financial instruments to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on its cash flows, unhedged exposures continue to be subject to currency fluctuations. In addition, the weakening or strengthening of the U.S. dollar may result in significant favorable or unfavorable translation effects when the operating results of the Company’s non-U.S. business activity are translated into U.S. dollars. Inflation and Currency Devaluation Risks : The Company faces challenges in maintaining profitability of operations in economies experiencing high inflation rates. Specifically, the Company has accounted for operations in Argentina, Turkey and Venezuela as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. While the Company strives to maintain profit margins in these areas through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price increases, it might experience operating losses as a result of continued inflation. In addition, the impact of currency devaluations in countries experiencing high inflation rates or significant currency exchange fluctuations could negatively impact the Company’s operating results. Illegal Importation of Pharmaceutical Products : The illegal importation of pharmaceutical products from countries where government price controls or other market dynamics result in lower prices may adversely affect the Company’s sales and profitability in the U.S. and other countries in which the Company operates. With the exception of limited quantities of prescription drugs for personal use, foreign imports of pharmaceutical products are illegal under current U.S. law. However, the volume of illegal imports continues to rise as the ability of patients and other customers to obtain the lower-priced imports has grown significantly. Anti-Bribery and Other Regulations: The Company is subject to various federal and foreign laws that govern its international business practices with respect to payments to government officials. Those laws include the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which prohibits U.S. publicly traded companies from promising, offering, or giving anything of value to foreign officials with the corrupt intent of influencing the foreign official for the purpose of helping the Company obtain or retain business or gain any improper advantage. The Company’s business is heavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with foreign officials. Also, in many countries outside the U.S., the healthcare providers who prescribe human pharmaceuticals are employed by the government and the purchasers of human pharmaceuticals are government entities; therefore, the Company’s interactions with these prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the FCPA. In addition to the U.S. application and enforcement of the FCPA, various jurisdictions in which the Company operates have laws 12 and regulations, including the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, aimed at preventing and penalizing corrupt and anticompetitive behavior. Enforcement activities under these laws could subject the Company to additional administrative and legal proceedings and actions, which could include claims for civil penalties, criminal sanctions, and administrative remedies, including exclusion from healthcare programs. Other Financial, Economic, Legal, Social and Political Risks . Other risks inherent in conducting business globally include: • local and regional economic environments and policies in the markets that we serve, including interest rates, monetary policy, inflation, economic growth, recession, commodity prices, and currency controls or other limitations on the ability to expatriate cash; • protective economic policies taken by governments, such as trade protection measures and import/export licensing requirements; • compliance with local regulations and laws including, in some countries, regulatory requirements restricting the Company’s ability to manufacture or sell its products in the relevant market; • diminished protection of intellectual property and contractual rights in certain jurisdictions; • potential nationalization or expropriation of the Company’s foreign assets; • political or social upheavals, economic instability, repression, or human rights issues; and • geopolitical events, including natural disasters, disruptions to markets due to war, armed conflict, terrorism, epidemics or pandemics. Failure to maintain a satisfactory credit rating could adversely affect our liquidity, capital position, borrowing costs and access to capital markets. We currently maintain investment grade credit ratings with Moody’s Investors Service and Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services. Rating agencies routinely evaluate us, and their ratings of our long-term and short-term debt are based on a number of factors. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency, whether as a result of our actions or factors which are beyond our control, can increase the cost of borrowing under any indebtedness we may incur, reduce market capacity for our commercial paper or require the posting of additional collateral under our derivative contracts. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our credit ratings, and any additional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade, may have a negative impact on our liquidity, capital position and access to capital markets. The Russia-Ukraine War, and actions taken in response to the Russia-Ukraine War, could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. In February 2022, Russia launched a military invasion of Ukraine. The ongoing Russia-Ukraine War has provoked strong reactions from the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union and various other countries and economic and political organizations around the world. We have been monitoring the geopolitical situation in Russia since the start of the Russia-Ukraine War and have suspended additional investment, enrollment of clinical trials, and supply of our personal care products in Russia. We continue to monitor the need for humanitarian relief in the region and continue to supply our medicines, medical devices and equipment in the region in compliance with the applicable sanctions. We will continue to monitor the geopolitical situation in Russia and to evaluate our activities and future operations in Russia. Actions taken in response to the Russia-Ukraine War include the imposition of export controls and broad financial and economic sanctions against Russia, Belarus and specific areas of Ukraine. Additional sanctions or other measures may be imposed by the global community, including but not limited to limitations on our ability to file, prosecute and maintain patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights. Furthermore, the Russian government has already taken action allowing Russian companies and individuals to exploit inventions owned by patent holders from the United States and many other countries without consent or compensation and we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in Russia or from selling or importing products in and into Russia. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, other risks related to the broad economic consequences of the Russia-Ukraine War, including foreign currency volatility, decreased demand for our products in countries affected by the Russia-Ukraine War and challenges to our global supply chain related to increased costs of materials and other inputs for our products and suppliers operating in Russia and Ukraine. We also continue to monitor the various sanctions and export controls imposed in response to the Russia-Ukraine War. The full impact of the Russia-Ukraine War, and actions taken in response to the ongoing conflict, on the global economy and geopolitical relations, in general, and on our business in particular, remain uncertain. Any or all of the foregoing risks could 13 have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition, particularly as the conflict continues for an indefinite period of time. Given that developments concerning the Russia-Ukraine War are ongoing and have been constantly evolving, additional impacts and risks may arise that are not presently known to us. The Russia-Ukraine War may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section. Risks Related to the Planned Separation of our Consumer Health Business The planned separation of the Company’s Consumer Health business may not be completed on the terms or timeline currently contemplated, if at all, and may not achieve the expected results. In November 2021, the Company announced its intention to separate the Company’s Consumer Health business, with the intention to create a standalone publicly traded company, which was subsequently named Kenvue, Inc. (""Kenvue""). The planned separation is intended to qualify as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Company is targeting completion of the planned separation in 2023. Completion of the planned separation will be subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including, among others, consultations with works councils and other employee representative bodies, as required, final approval by the Company’s Board of Directors, the continuing effectiveness and validity of the Company's private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and receipt of favorable opinions of the Company's U.S. tax advisors with respect to the tax-free nature of the transaction, and the receipt of other regulatory approvals. There can be no assurance regarding the ultimate timing of the planned separation or that such separation will be completed. Unanticipated developments could delay, prevent or otherwise adversely affect the planned separation, including but not limited to disruptions in general or financial market conditions or potential problems or delays in obtaining various regulatory and tax approvals or clearances. The costs to complete the planned separation will be significant. In addition, the Company may be unable to achieve some or all of the strategic and financial benefits that it expects to achieve from the planned separation of the Company’s Consumer Health business. The Company has incurred, and is expected to incur, significant expenses in connection with the planned separation. In addition, the Company may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits that are expected to result from the planned separation. The anticipated benefits of the planned separation are based on a number of assumptions, some of which may prove incorrect. Following the planned separation, the price of shares of the Company’s common stock may fluctuate significantly. The Company cannot predict the effect of the planned separation on the trading price of shares of its common stock, and the market value of shares of its common stock may be less than, equal to or greater than the market value of shares of its common stock prior to the planned separation. In addition, the price of the Company’s common stock may be more volatile around the time of the planned separation. The planned separation could result in substantial tax liability. The Company has received a private letter ruling from the IRS as to the tax-free nature of the planned separation under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The planned separation is conditioned on, among other things, the continuing effectiveness and validity of the Company's private letter ruling from the IRS and receipt of favorable opinions of the Company's U.S. tax advisors. The private letter ruling and opinions will be based on, among other things, various facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from the Company and Kenvue regarding the past and future conduct of the companies’ respective businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are incorrect or not otherwise satisfied, the Company and its shareholders may not be able to rely on the ruling or the opinions of tax advisors. Notwithstanding the private letter ruling and opinions of tax advisors, if subsequent to the planned separation the IRS determines that certain steps of the transaction do not qualify for tax-free treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the resulting tax liability to the Company and its shareholders could be substantial. The planned separation may also not qualify for tax-free treatment in other countries around the world, and as a result may trigger substantial tax liability to the Company. Other Risks Our business depends on our ability to recruit and retain talented, highly skilled employees and a diverse workforce. Our continued growth requires us to recruit and retain talented employees representing diverse backgrounds, experiences, and skill sets. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive and our ability to compete depends on our ability to hire, develop and motivate highly skilled personnel in all areas of our organization. Maintaining our brand and reputation, as well as a diverse, equitable and inclusive work environment enables us to attract top talent. If we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain highly skilled workers and key leaders, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected. In addition, effective succession planning is important to our long-term success. Any unsuccessful implementation of our succession plans or failure to ensure effective transfer of 14 knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Climate change or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change may negatively affect our business and results of operations. Climate change resulting from increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could present risks to our operations, including an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. Natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, such as a hurricane, tornado, earthquake, wildfire or flooding, may pose physical risks to our facilities and disrupt the operation of our supply chain. The impacts of the changing climate on water resources may result in water scarcity, limiting our ability to access sufficient high-quality water in certain locations, which may increase operational costs. Concern over climate change may also result in new or additional legal or regulatory requirements designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and/or mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment. If such laws or regulations are more stringent than current legal or regulatory obligations, we may experience disruption in, or an increase in the costs associated with sourcing, manufacturing and distribution of our products, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. Further, the impacts of climate change have an influence on customer preferences, and failure to provide climate-friendly products could potentially result in loss of market share. An information security incident, including a cybersecurity breach, could have a negative impact to the Company’s business or reputation. To meet business objectives, the Company relies on both internal information technology (IT) systems and networks, and those of third parties and their vendors, to process and store sensitive data, including confidential research, business plans, financial information, intellectual property, and personal data that may be subject to legal protection, and ensure the continuity of the Company’s supply chain. The extensive information security and cybersecurity threats, which affect companies globally, pose a risk to the security and availability of these systems and networks, and the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the Company’s sensitive data. The Company continually assesses these threats and makes investments to increase internal protection, detection, and response capabilities, as well as ensure the Company’s third-party providers have required capabilities and controls, to address this risk . To date, the Company has not experienced any material impact to the business or operations resulting from information or cybersecurity attacks; however, because of the frequently changing attack techniques, along with the increased volume and sophistication of the attacks, there is the potential for the Company to be adversely impacted. This impact could result in reputational, competitive, operational or other business harm as well as financial costs and regulatory action. The Company maintains cybersecurity insurance in the event of an information security or cyber incident; however, the coverage may not be sufficient to cover all financial, legal, business or reputational losses. As a result of the Russia-Ukraine War, there has been, and we expect there will continue to be, an increased risk of information security or cybersecurity incidents, including cyberattacks perpetrated by Russia or others at its direction. Although we have taken steps to enhance our protections against these attacks, we may not be able to address the threat of information security or cybersecurity incidents proactively or implement adequate preventative measures and we may not be able to detect and address any such disruption or security breach promptly, or at all, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. Moreover, we are aware of incidents in which our third-party partners have been the target of information security or cybersecurity incidents as a result of the Russia-Ukraine War. Although, to date, our IT Systems have not been compromised by these incidents, it is possible that future information security or cybersecurity incidents involving our customers, manufacturers, suppliers or other third-party partners could successfully compromise our IT Systems, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. A breach of privacy laws or unauthorized access, loss or misuse of personal data could have a negative impact to the Company’s business or reputation. The Company is subject to privacy and data protection laws across the globe that impose broad compliance obligations on the collection, use, storage, access, transfer and protection of personal data. Breach of such requirements could result in substantial fines, penalties, private right of actions, claims and damage to our reputation and business. New privacy laws are expected in other territories, together with greater privacy enforcement by governmental authorities globally, particularly on data localization requirements and international data flows. The Company has established privacy compliance programs and controls that our businesses worldwide are required to comply with, but with many technology and data-driven initiatives being prioritized across the Company and involving multiple vendors and third parties, there are potential risks of controls imposed on cross border data flows, unauthorized access, and loss of personal data through internal and external threats that could impact our business operations and research activities. 15 Item 1B.

Item 6. Reserved 20 Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION Organization and Business Segments Description of the Company and Business Segments Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 152,700 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the healthcare field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world with the primary focus on products related to human health and well-being. The Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer Health, Pharmaceutical and MedTech. The Consumer Health segment includes a broad range of products used in the Baby Care, Oral Care, Skin Health/Beauty, Over-the-Counter pharmaceutical, Women’s Health and Wound Care markets. These products are marketed to the general public and sold online (eCommerce) and to retail outlets and distributors throughout the world. The Pharmaceutical segment is focused on the following therapeutic areas, including Immunology, Infectious diseases, Neuroscience, Oncology, Pulmonary Hypertension, and Cardiovascular and Metabolic diseases. Products in this segment are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers, distributors, hospitals and healthcare professionals for prescription use. The MedTech segment includes a broad portfolio of products used in the Orthopaedic, Surgery, Interventional Solutions (cardiovascular and neurovascular) and Vision fields. These products are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics. The Executive Committee of Johnson & Johnson is the principal management group responsible for the strategic operations and allocation of the resources of the Company. This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities of the Consumer Health, Pharmaceutical and MedTech business segments. In all of its product lines, the Company competes with other companies both locally and globally, throughout the world. Competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved. Competition in research, involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. The development of new and innovative products, as well as protecting the underlying intellectual property of the Company's product portfolio, is important to the Company’s success in all areas of its business. The competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research. In addition, the development and maintenance of customer demand for the Company’s consumer products involves significant expenditures for advertising and promotion. Management’s Objectives With “Our Credo” as the foundation, the Company’s purpose is to blend heart, science and ingenuity to profoundly change the trajectory of health for humanity. The Company is committed to bringing its full breadth and depth to ensure health for people today and for future generations. United around this common ambition, the Company is poised to fulfill its purpose and successfully meet the demands of the rapidly evolving markets in which it competes. The Company is broadly based in human healthcare, and is committed to creating value by developing accessible, high quality, innovative products and services. New products introduced within the past five years accounted for approximately 25% of 2022 sales. In 2022, $14.6 billion was invested in research and development reflecting management’s commitment to create life-enhancing innovations and to create value through partnerships that will profoundly change the trajectory of health for humanity. A critical driver of the Company’s success is the diversity of its 152,700 employees worldwide. Employees are empowered and inspired to lead with Our Credo and purpose as guides. This allows every employee to use the Company’s reach and size to advance the Company’s purpose, and to also lead with agility and urgency. Leveraging the extensive resources across the enterprise enables the Company to innovate and execute with excellence. This ensures the Company can remain focused on addressing the unmet needs of society every day and invest for an enduring impact, ultimately delivering value to its patients, consumers and healthcare professionals, employees, communities and shareholders. 21 Results of Operations Analysis of Consolidated Sales For discussion on results of operations and financial condition pertaining to the fiscal years 2021 and 2020 see the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 2, 2022, Item 7.

Operational growth was primarily attributable to increased Cough/Cold/Flu, adult and pediatric incidences, price actions primarily in the U.S. and increased consumption in China due to easing of COVID-19 restrictions. Growth was partially offset by supply constraints. The Skin Health/Beauty franchise sales of $4.4 billion declined 4.2% as compared to the prior year. The operational decline was driven by supply constraints in the U.S. partially offset by price actions and strong new product performance in the Asia Pacific and Latin America region. The Oral Care franchise sales of $1.5 billion declined 8.5% as compared to the prior year. The operational decline was due to portfolio simplification in the U.S., competitive pressures in EMEA and China, category decline and pricing pressures in EMEA, as well as suspension of personal care sales in Russia and negative COVID-19 impacts in China. The Baby Care franchise sales of $1.5 billion declined 6.7% as compared to the prior year. The operational decline was driven by category deceleration and competitive pressures in the U.S., suspension of personal care sales in Russia and weakness in India. The Women’s Health franchise sales of $0.9 billion declined 1.5% as compared to the prior year. Operational growth driven by lapping prior year supply constraints in EMEA, strength in India, and price actions in LATAM was partially offset by suspension of personal care sales in Russia and negative currency impacts. The Wound Care/Other franchise sales of $0.7 billion declined 5.3% as compared to the prior year. The operational decline was driven by lapping strong prior year consumption, competitive pressure in the U.S., and decreased consumption in China. In November 2021, the Company announced its intention to separate the Company’s Consumer Health business (Kenvue as the name for the planned New Consumer Health Company), with the intention to create a new, publicly traded company by the end of the fiscal year 2023. 23 Pharmaceutical Segment Pharmaceutical segment sales in 2022 were $52.6 billion, an increase of 1.7% from 2021, which included operational growth of 6.7% and a negative currency impact of 5.0%. U.S. sales were $28.6 billion, an increase of 2.3%. International sales were $24.0 billion, an increase of 1.0%, which included 11.9% operational growth and a negative currency impact of 10.9%. In 2022, acquisitions and divestitures had a net negative impact of 0.1% on the operational sales growth of the worldwide Pharmaceutical segment. Adjustments to previous sales reserve estimates were approximately $0.1 billion and $0.7 billion in fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Operational growth was driven by strong uptake of STELARA (ustekinumab) in Crohn's disease and Ulcerative Colitis and strength of TREMFYA (guselkumab) in Psoriasis and uptake in Psoriatic Arthritis. This was partially offset by lower sales of REMICADE (infliximab) due to biosimilar competition. Biosimilar versions of REMICADE have been introduced in the United States and certain markets outside the United States and additional competitors continue to enter the market. Continued infliximab biosimilar competition will result in a further reduction in sales of REMICADE. The latest expiring United States patent for STELARA (ustekinumab) will expire in September 2023. STELARA (ustekinumab) U.S. sales in fiscal 2022 were approximately $6.4 billion and the expiration of this product patent or loss of market exclusivity will result in a reduction in sales. Infectious disease products sales were $5.4 billion in 2022, representing a decline of 6.5% as compared to the prior year. Operational growth was driven by the COVID-19 vaccine outside the U.S partially offset by lower sales of PREZISTA and PREZCOBIX/REZOLSTA (darunavir/cobicistat) due to increased competition and loss of exclusivity of PREZISTA in certain countries outside the U.S. Neuroscience products sales were $6.9 billion, in 2022, representing a decline of 1.4% as compared to the prior year. The operational sales growth of INVEGA SUSTENNA/XEPLION (paliperidone palmitate) and INVEGA TRINZA/TREVICTA from new patient starts and persistence as well as the launch of INVEGA HAFYERA was offset by negative currency impacts and lower sales of RISPERDAL CONSTA. Oncology products achieved sales of $16.0 billion in 2022, representing an increase of 9.9% as compared to the prior year. Contributions to operational growth were strong sales of DARZALEX (daratumumab) driven by share gains in all regions, continued strong market growth, and uptake of the subcutaneous formulation as well as the continued global launch uptake of ERLEADA (apalutamide). This was partially offset by declining sales of IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib) due to competitive pressures and market suppression and ZYTIGA due to loss of exclusivity in the European Union in the second half of 2022. Pulmonary Hypertension products sales were $3.4 billion, a decline of 1.0% as compared to the prior year. The operational sales growth of OPSUMIT (macitentan) and UPTRAVI (selexipag) due to continued share gains and market growth was offset by COVID-19 related impacts and continued declines in Other Pulmonary Hypertension. Cardiovascular/Metabolism/Other products sales were $3.9 billion, a decline of 5.6% as compared to the prior year. The operational decline was primarily attributable to lower sales of INVOKANA/INVOKAMET (canagliflozin) due to share erosion and PROCRIT/ EPREX (epoetin alfa) due to biosimilar competition. The Company updated its policy so that no end customer will be permitted direct delivery of product to a location other than the billing location. The policy impacts contract pharmacy transactions involving non-grantee 340B covered entities for most of the Company’s drugs, subject to multiple exceptions. Both grantee and non-grantee covered entities can maintain certain contract pharmacy arrangements under policy exceptions. The Company has been and will continue to offer 340B discounts to covered entities on all of its covered outpatient drugs, and it believes its policy will improve its ability to identify inappropriate duplicate discounts and diversion prohibited by the 340B statute. The 340B Drug Pricing Program is a U.S. federal government program requiring drug manufacturers to provide significant discounts on covered outpatient drugs to covered entities. This policy update had discount implications which positively impacted sales to customers in 2022. 25 During 2022, the Company advanced its pipeline with several regulatory submissions and approvals for new drugs and additional indications for existing drugs as follows: Product Name (Chemical Name) Indication US Approval EU Approval US Filing EU Filing aprocitentan Treatment for difficult to treat hypertension • CABENUVA (rilpivirine and cabotegravir) HIV treatment for adolescents • CARVYKTI (ciltacabtagene autoleucel) Treatment for patients with relapsed or refractory Multiple Myeloma • • ERLEADA (apalutamide) Tablet reduction • • IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib) Treatment for Pediatric Patients with Chronic Graft-Versus-Host Disease • Treatment for Frontline Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (I + V fixed duration) (GLOW) • niraparib Treatment of L1 Prostate cancer metastatic castration-resistant in combination with abiraterone acetate and Prednisone • STELARA (ustekinumab) Treatment of Pediatric Patients with Juvenile Psoriatic Arthritis • Talquetamab Treatment of Patients with Relapsed Refractory Multiple Myeloma • teclistamab (BCMA/CD3) Treatment of Patients with Relapsed Refractory Multiple Myeloma • • 26 MedTech Segment** The MedTech segment sales in 2022 were $27.4 billion, an increase of 1.4% from 2021, which included operational growth of 6.2% and a negative currency impact of 4.8%. U.S. sales were $13.4 billion, an increase of 5.4% as compared to the prior year. International sales were $14.1 billion, a decrease of 2.3% as compared to the prior year, which included operational growth of 6.9% and a negative currency impact of 9.2%.

The operational growth in Advanced Surgery was primarily driven by the following: Endocutter market recovery and new products partially offset by competitive pressures in the U.S.; Biosurgery market recovery and the success of new products partially offset by strong U.S. market demand in the prior year for infection prevention products; and Energy products driven by market recovery and new product penetration coupled with competitive supply challenges. The operational growth in General Surgery was primarily driven by market recovery and technology penetration. The Orthopaedics franchise sales were $8.6 billion in 2022, which was flat to the prior year. The Orthopaedics franchise included operational sales growth of 3.7% offset by a negative currency impact of 3.7%. The operational growth in hips reflects the market recovery combined with continued strength of the portfolio including the ACTIS stem and enabling technologies – KINCISE and VELYS Hip Navigation. This growth was partially offset by impacts of volume-based procurement in China and the timing of tenders outside the U.S. The operational growth in knees was primarily driven by procedure recovery, strength of the ATTUNE portfolio and pull through related to the VELYS Robotic assisted solution. This growth was partially offset by impacts of volume-based procurement in China and timing of tenders outside the U.S. The operational growth in Trauma was driven by global market recovery and uptake of new products. The operational growth in Spine, Sports & Other was primarily driven by procedure recovery and new product introductions. This growth was partially offset by competitive pressures in Spine and impacts of volume-based procurement in China. The Vision franchise achieved sales of $4.8 billion in 2022, representing an increase of 3.4% from 2021. The Contact Lenses/Other operational growth was due to market recovery, price actions, commercial execution and benefits from new products. Surgical Vision operational growth was primarily due to market recovery and the success of new products and was partially offset by a higher prior year U.S. Refractory market. The Interventional Solutions franchise achieved sales of $4.3 billion in 2022, representing an increase of 8.3% from 2021. Operational growth was driven by market recovery and success of new products and commercial strategies. Interventional solutions also includes sales from Abiomed, Inc. (Abiomed) which were reflected as of December 22, 2022. 27 Analysis of Consolidated Earnings Before Provision for Taxes on Income Consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income was $21.7 billion and $22.8 billion for the years 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Percentages in chart are as a percent to total sales) Cost of Products Sold and Selling, Marketing and Administrative Expenses: (Dollars in billions. Percentages in chart are as a percent to total sales) Cost of products sold increased as a percent to sales driven by: • One-time COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing exit related costs • Currency impacts in the Pharmaceutical segment • Commodity inflation in the MedTech and Consumer Health segments partially offset by • Supply chain benefits in the Consumer Health segment The intangible asset amortization expense included in cost of products sold was $4.3 billion and $4.7 billion for the fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. 28 Selling, Marketing and Administrative Expenses decreased as a percent to sales driven by: • Reduction of brand marketing expenses in the Pharmaceutical and Consumer Health businesses Research and Development Expense: Research and development expense by segment of business was as follows: 2022 2021 (Dollars in Millions) Amount % of Sales* Amount % of Sales* Consumer Health $ 493 3.3 % $ 459 3.1 % Pharmaceutical 11,622 22.1 11,878 23.0 MedTech 2,488 9.1 2,377 8.8 Total research and development expense $ 14,603 15.4 % $ 14,714 15.7 % Percent increase/(decrease) over the prior year (0.8) % 21.0 % *As a percent to segment sales Research and development activities represent a significant part of the Company's business. These expenditures relate to the processes of discovering, testing and developing new products, upfront payments and developmental milestones, improving existing products, as well as ensuring product efficacy and regulatory compliance prior to launch. The Company remains committed to investing in research and development with the aim of delivering high quality and innovative products. Research and Development decreased as a percent to sales primarily driven by: • Lower milestone payments in the Pharmaceutical business In-Process Research and Development (IPR&D): In the fiscal year 2022, the Company recorded an intangible asset impairment charge of approximately $0.8 billion related to an in-process research and development asset, bermekimab (JnJ-77474462), an investigational drug for the treatment of Atopic Dermatitis (AD) and Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS). Additional information regarding efficacy of the AD indication and HS indication became available which led the Company to the decision to terminate the development of bermekimab for both AD and HS. The Company acquired all rights to bermekimab from XBiotech, Inc. in the fiscal year 2020. In fiscal year 2021, the Company recorded a partial IPR&D charge of $0.9 billion primarily related to expected development delays in the general surgery digital robotics platform (Ottava) acquired with the Auris Health acquisition in 2019. The impairment charge was calculated based on revisions to the discounted cash flow valuation model reflecting a delay of first in human procedures of approximately two years from the initial acquisition model assumption of the second half of 2022. The Company will continue to monitor the remaining $1.5 billion Ottava platform intangible asset as development program activities are ongoing. Other (Income) Expense, Net: Other (income) expense, net is the account where the Company records gains and losses related to the sale and write-down of certain investments in equity securities held by Johnson & Johnson Innovation - JJDC, Inc. (JJDC), changes in the fair value of securities, investment (income)/loss related to employee benefit programs, gains and losses on divestitures, certain transactional currency gains and losses, acquisition and divestiture related costs, litigation accruals and settlements, as well as royalty income. Other (income) expense, net for the fiscal year 2022 was unfavorable by $1.4 billion as compared to the prior year primarily due to the following: (Dollars in Billions)(Income)/Expense 2022 2021 Change Consumer Health separation costs $ 1.0 0.1 0.9 Litigation related (1) 0.9 2.3 (1.4) Changes in the fair value of securities 0.7 (0.5) 1.2 One-time COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing exit related costs 0.7 0.0 0.7 Acquisition, Integration and Divestiture related (2) 0.1 (0.5) 0.6 Restructuring related 0.1 0.1 0.0 Employee benefit plan related (1.2) (0.6) (0.6) Other (0.4) (0.4) — Total Other (Income) Expense, Net $ 1.9 0.5 1.4 ( 1) 2022 was primarily related to pelvic mesh and 2021 was primarily related to talc and Risperdal Gynecomastia (2) 2022 was primarily costs related to the acquisition of Abiomed. 2021 was p rimarily related to divestiture gains of two pharmaceutical brands outside the U.S. 29 Interest (Income) Expense: Interest (income) expense in the fiscal of 2022 was net interest income of $214 million as compared to interest expense of $130 million in the fiscal year 2021 primarily due to higher rates of interest earned on cash balances. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $23.5 billion at the end of 2022, and averaged $27.6 billion as compared to the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities total of $31.6 billion and $28.4 billion average cash balance in 2021. The total debt balance at the end of 2022 was $39.7 billion with an average debt balance of $36.7 billion as compared to $33.8 billion at the end of 2021 and an average debt balance of $34.5 billion. The lower average cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and higher average debt balance were primarily due to the acquisition of Abiomed in late December of 2022. Income Before Tax by Segment Income (loss) before tax by segment of business were as follows: Income Before Tax Segment Sales Percent of Segment Sales (Dollars in Millions) 2022 2021 2022 2021 2022 2021 Consumer Health (3) $ 2,930 1,573 14,953 15,035 19.6 % 10.5 Pharmaceutical (3) 15,901 17,969 52,563 51,680 30.3 34.8 MedTech 4,607 4,373 27,427 27,060 16.8 16.2 Segment earnings before tax (1) 23,438 23,915 94,943 93,775 24.7 25.5 Less: Expenses not allocated to segments (2) 624 1,072 Less: Consumer Health separation costs 1,089 67 Worldwide income before tax $ 21,725 22,776 94,943 93,775 22.9 % 24.3 (1) See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details. (2) Amounts not allocated to segments include interest (income) expense and general corporate (income) expense. (3) Prior year income before tax of approximately $0.2 billion has been reclassified as certain international OTC products, primarily in China, were reclassified from the Pharmaceutical segment to the Consumer Health segment based on operational changes. Consumer Health Segment: In 2022, the Consumer Health segment income before tax as a percent of sales was 19.6% versus 10.5% in 2021. The increase in the income before tax as a percent of sales was primarily driven by the following: • Lower litigation expense of $0.2 billion in 2022 versus $1.6 billion (primarily talc related) in 2021 • Reduction in brand marketing expenses in 2022 versus 2021 • Supply chain benefits in 2022 partially offset by: • Commodity inflation in 2022 Pharmaceutical Segment: In 2022, the Pharmaceutical segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 30.3% versus 34.8% in 2021. The decrease in the income before tax as a percent of sales was primarily driven by the following: • One-time COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing exit related costs of $1.5 billion in 2022 • Unfavorable changes in the fair value of securities ($0.7 billion loss in 2022 vs. $0.5 billion gain in 2021) • An IPR&D charge of $0.8 billion in 2022 related to bermekimab (JnJ-77474462), an investigational drug for the treatment of Atopic Dermatitis (AD) and Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS) • Lower divestiture gains of $0.1 billion in 2022 versus $0.6 billion related to two pharmaceutical brands outside the U.S. in fiscal 2021 • Currency impacts in Cost of Products Sold partially offset by: • Lower litigation related expense of $0.1 billion in 2022 versus $0.6 billion (primarily related to Risperdal Gynecomastia) in 2021 • Lower Research & Development milestone payments in 2022 • Lower brand marketing expenses in 2022 versus 2021 In fiscal 2020 and 2021, the Company entered into a series of contract manufacturing arrangements for vaccine production with third party contract manufacturing organizations. These arrangements provided the Company with supplemental commercial capacity for vaccine production and potentially transferable rights to such production if capacity is not required. The Company continues to evaluate and monitor both its internal and external supply arrangements. In fiscal 2022, the COVID-19 Vaccine related costs (mentioned above) included the remaining commitments and obligations, including external manufacturing network exit and related inventory costs and required clinical trial expenses, associated with the Company's modification of its 30 COVID-19 vaccine research program and manufacturing capacity to levels that meet all remaining customer contractual requirements. MedTech Segment: In 2022, the MedTech segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 16.8% versus 16.2% in 2021. The increase in the income before tax as a percent to sales was primarily driven by the following: • An IPR&D charge of $0.9 billion in 2021 related to the general surgery offering in digital robotics (Ottava) acquired with the Auris Health acquisition in 2019 partially offset by: • Higher litigation related expense of $0.6 billion in 2022, primarily related to pelvic mesh costs versus $0.1 billion in 2021 • Acquisition related costs of $0.3 billion in 2022 related to the Abiomed acquisition versus $0.1 billion in 2021 Restructuring: In the fiscal second quarter of 2018, the Company announced plans to implement actions across its Global Supply Chain that are intended to enable the Company to focus resources and increase investments in critical capabilities, technologies and solutions necessary to manufacture and supply its product portfolio of the future, enhance agility and drive growth. The Global Supply Chain actions included expanding its use of strategic collaborations, and bolstering its initiatives to reduce complexity, improving cost-competitiveness, enhancing capabilities and optimizing its supply chain network. The Company has achieved approximately $0.8 billion in annual pre-tax cost savings as outlined in the restructuring actions. In 2022, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $0.5 billion, which is included on the following lines of the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, $0.3 billion in restructuring, $0.1 billion in other (income) expense and $0.1 billion in cost of products sold. Total project costs of approximately $2.2 billion have been recorded since the restructuring was announced. The program was completed in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2022. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the restructuring programs. Provision for Taxes on Income: The worldwide effective income tax rate was 17.4% in 2022 and 8.3% in 2021. In the fiscal 2022, the Company incurred approximately $0.5 billion net incremental international tax cost related to the legal separation of the Consumer Health business, and may continue to incur additional cost in fiscal 2023. On December 15, 2022, the European Union (EU) Member States formally adopted the EU’s Pillar Two Directive, which generally provides for a minimum effective tax rate of 15%, as established by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Pillar Two Framework that was supported by over 130 countries worldwide. The EU effective dates are January 1, 2024, and January 1, 2025, for different aspects of the directive. A significant number of other countries are expected to also implement similar legislation, including South Korea which approved legislation on December 23, 2022 with a full effective date of January 1, 2024. The Company is continuing to evaluate the potential impact on future periods of the Pillar Two Framework, pending legislative adoption by additional individual countries, including those within the European Union. For discussion related to the fiscal 2022 provision for taxes refer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity & Cash Flows Cash and cash equivalents were $14.1 billion at the end of 2022 as compared to $14.5 billion at the end of 2021. The primary sources and uses of cash that contributed to the $0.4 billion decrease were: (Dollars In Billions) $ 14.5 Q4 2021 Cash and cash equivalents balance 21.2 cash generated from operating activities (12.4) net cash used by investing activities (8.9) net cash used by financing activities $ (0.3) effect of exchange rate and rounding $ 14.1 Q4 2022 Cash and cash equivalents balance In addition, the Company had $9.4 billion in marketable securities at the end of fiscal year 2022 and $17.1 billion at the end of fiscal year 2021. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. 31 Cash flow from operations of $21.2 billion was the result of: (Dollars In Billions) $ 17.9 Net Earnings 7.3 non-cash expenses and other adjustments primarily for depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation and asset write-downs partially offset by the deferred tax provision, net gain on sale of assets/businesses and credit losses and accounts receivable allowances (2.0) a decrease in current and non-current liabilities 0.7 a decrease in other current and non-current assets 1.1 an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities (3.8) an increase in accounts receivable and inventories $ 21.2 Cash Flow from operations Investing activities use of $12.4 billion of cash was primarily used for: (Dollars In Billions) $ (4.0) additions to property, plant and equipment (17.7) acquisitions 0.5 proceeds from the disposal of assets/businesses, net 9.2 net sales of investments (0.2) Credit support agreements activity, net (0.2) other (primarily licenses and milestones) and rounding $ (12.4) Net cash used for investing activities Financing activities use of $8.9 billion of cash was primarily used for: (Dollars In Billions) $ (11.7) dividends to shareholders (6.0) repurchase of common stock 7.5 net proceeds from short and long term debt 1.3 proceeds from stock options exercised/employee withholding tax on stock awards, net $ (8.9) Net cash used for financing activities As of January 1, 2023, the Company's notes payable and long-term debt was in excess of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. As of January 1, 2023, the net debt position was $16.1 billion as compared to the prior year of $2.1 billion. The increase was primarily due to the acquisition of Abiomed, Inc. in December 2022. The debt balance at the end of 2022 was $39.7 billion as compared to $33.8 billion in 2021. Considering recent market conditions, the Company has re-evaluated its operating cash flows and liquidity profile and does not foresee any significant incremental risk. The Company anticipates that operating cash flows, the ability to raise funds from external sources, borrowing capacity from existing committed credit facilities and access to the commercial paper markets will continue to provide sufficient resources to fund operating needs, including the Company's remaining balance to be paid on the agreement to settle opioid litigation for approximately $2.7 billion and the establishment of the $2.0 billion trust for talc related liabilities (See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details). In addition, the Company monitors the global capital markets on an ongoing basis and from time to time may raise capital when market conditions are favorable. Effective beginning in fiscal 2022, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Job Act of 2017 (TCJA) requires the Company to deduct U.S. and international research and development expenditures for tax purposes over 5 to 15 years, instead of in the current fiscal year. As a result, in fiscal 2022, the Company experienced an increase in annual cash tax payments of approximately $1.2 billion above what otherwise would have been remitted to the U.S Treasury. The Company concurrently records a deferred tax benefit for the future amortization of the research and development (R&D) for tax purposes. The requirement to expense R&D as incurred is unchanged for U.S. GAAP purposes and the impact to pre-tax R&D expense is not affected by this provision. On September 14, 2022, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program, authorizing the Company to purchase up to $5.0 billion of the Company's Common Stock. Share repurchases may be made at management’s discretion from time to time on the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. The repurchase program has no time limit and may be suspended for periods or discontinued at any time. Any shares acquired will be available 32 for general corporate purposes. The Company intends to finance the share repurchase program through available cash. Through January 1, 2023, approximately $2.5 billion has been repurchased under the program. The following table summarizes the Company’s material contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as of January 1, 2023: To satisfy these obligations, the Company intends to use cash from operations.

Financing and Market Risk The Company uses financial instruments to manage the impact of foreign exchange rate changes on cash flows. Accordingly, the Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to protect the value of certain foreign currency assets and liabilities and to hedge future foreign currency transactions primarily related to product costs. Gains or losses on these contracts are offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions. A 10% appreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the January 1, 2023 market rates would increase the unrealized value of the Company’s forward contracts by $0.1 billion. Conversely, a 10% depreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the January 1, 2023 market rates would decrease the unrealized value of the Company’s forward contracts by $0.1 billion. In either scenario, the gain or loss on the forward contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated earnings and cash flows. The Company hedges the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and the effect on certain assets and liabilities in foreign currency, by entering into currency swap contracts. A 1% change in the spread between U.S. and foreign interest rates on the Company’s interest rate sensitive financial instruments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of the Company’s swap contracts by approximately $1.7 billion. In either scenario, at maturity, the gain or loss on the swap contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated cash flows. The Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Further, the Company has a policy of only entering into contracts with parties that have at least an investment grade credit rating. The counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions and there is no significant concentration of exposure with any one counterparty. Management believes the risk of loss is remote. The Company entered into credit support agreements (CSA) with certain derivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on respective credit ratings and netting agreements. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on credit support agreements. The Company invests in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities which carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. A 1% (100 basis points) change in spread on the Company’s interest rate sensitive investments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of cash equivalents and current marketable securities by less than $0.1 billion. The Company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous banks worldwide. In September 2022, the Company secured a new 364-day Credit Facility of $10 billion, which expires on September 7, 2023. In November 2022, the Company secured an additional 364-day revolving Credit Facility of $10 billion, which has an expiration of November 21, 2023. Interest charged on borrowings under the credit line agreement is based on either Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) Reference Rate or other applicable market rate as allowed plus applicable margins. Commitment fees under the agreement are not material. Total borrowings at the end of 2022 and 2021 were $39.7 billion and $33.8 billion, respectively. The increase in borrowings was due to the acquisition of Abiomed, Inc. In 2022, net debt (cash and current marketable securities, net of debt) was $16.1 billion compared to net debt of $2.1 billion in 2021. Total debt represented 34.1% of total capital (shareholders’ equity and total debt) in 2022 and 31.3% of total capital in 2021. Shareholders’ equity per share at the end of 2022 was $29.39 compared to $28.16 at year-end 2021. A summary of borrowings can be found in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 33 Dividends The Company increased its dividend in 2022 for the 60th consecutive year. Cash dividends paid were $4.45 per share in 2022 and $4.19 per share in 2021. On January 3, 2023, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $1.13 per share, payable on March 7, 2023 to shareholders of record as of February 21, 2023. Other Information Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are based on the Company’s consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and other related disclosures. Actual results may or may not differ from these estimates. The Company believes that the understanding of certain key accounting policies and estimates are essential in achieving more insight into the Company’s operating results and financial condition. These key accounting policies include revenue recognition, income taxes, legal and self-insurance contingencies, valuation of long-lived assets, assumptions used to determine the amounts recorded for pensions and other employee benefit plans and accounting for stock based awards. Revenue Recognition: The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the goods to customers. The Company's global payment terms are typically between 30 to 90 days. Provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns, discounts to customers and governmental clawback provisions are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales. Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants, as well as market conditions, including consideration of competitor pricing. Rebates are estimated based on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served. The Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through the analysis of wholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally generated information. Sales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals. Sales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in the field, or in specific areas, product recall. The sales returns reserve is based on historical return trends by product and by market as a percent to gross sales. In accordance with the Company’s accounting policies, the Company generally issues credit to customers for returned goods. The Company’s sales returns reserves are accounted for in accordance with the U.S. GAAP guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns reserves are recorded at full sales value. Sales returns in the Consumer Health and Pharmaceutical segments are almost exclusively not resalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the MedTech segment are typically resalable but are not material. The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products. The sales returns reserve for the total Company has been approximately 1.0% of annual net trade sales during the fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020. Promotional programs, such as product listing allowances and cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in the same period as related sales. Continuing promotional programs include coupons and volume-based sales incentive programs. The redemption cost of consumer coupons is based on historical redemption experience by product and value. Volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales volumes for the incentive period and are recorded as products are sold. These arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred or recorded as a reduction of revenue. The Company also earns profit-share payments through collaborative arrangements of certain products, which are included in sales to customers. Profit-share payments were less than 2.0% of the total revenues in fiscal year 2022 and less than 3.0% of the total revenues in fiscal years 2021 and 2020 and are included in sales to customers. In addition, the Company enters into collaboration arrangements that contain multiple revenue generating activities. Amounts due from collaborative partners for these arrangements are recognized as each activity is performed or delivered, based on the relative selling price. Upfront fees received as part of these arrangements are deferred and recognized over the performance period. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures on collaborations. Reasonably likely changes to assumptions used to calculate the accruals for rebates, returns and promotions are not anticipated to have a material effect on the financial statements. The Company currently discloses the impact of changes to assumptions in the quarterly or annual filing in which there is a material financial statement impact. 34 Below are tables that show the progression of accrued rebates, returns, promotions, reserve for doubtful accounts and reserve for cash discounts by segment of business for the fiscal years ended January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022.

Income Taxes: Income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and include the results of any difference between U.S. GAAP accounting and tax reporting, recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities. The Company estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on enacted tax regulations and rates. Future changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company follows U.S. GAAP, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Management believes that changes in these estimates would not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial position. The Company has recorded deferred tax liabilities on all undistributed earnings prior to December 31, 2017 from its international subsidiaries. The Company has not provided deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings subsequent to January 1, 2018 from certain international subsidiaries where the earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. The Company intends to continue to reinvest these earnings in those international operations. If the Company decides at a later date to repatriate these earnings to the U.S., the Company would be required to provide for the net tax effects on these amounts. The Company estimates that the tax effect of this repatriation would be approximately $0.5 billion under currently enacted tax laws and regulations and at current currency exchange rates. This amount does not include the possible benefit of U.S. foreign tax credits, which may substantially offset this cost. See Note 1 and Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding income taxes. Legal and Self Insurance Contingencies: The Company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal proceedings and product liability claims as these arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on management’s judgment as to the probability of losses and, where applicable, actuarially determined estimates. The Company has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals in the self insurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated. The Company follows the provisions of U.S. GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies. A liability is recorded when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. See Notes 1 and 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding product liability and legal proceedings. 36 Long-Lived and Intangible Assets: The Company assesses changes, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows in evaluating the value of the Company’s property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets. As these assumptions and estimates may change over time, it may or may not be necessary for the Company to record impairment charges. Employee Benefit Plans: The Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit, defined contribution and termination indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide. These plans are based on assumptions for the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, expected salary increases, healthcare cost trend rates and attrition rates. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on these rates. Stock Based Compensation: The Company recognizes compensation expense associated with the issuance of equity instruments to employees for their services. Based on the type of equity instrument, the fair value is estimated on the date of grant using either the Black-Scholes option valuation model or a combination of both the Black-Scholes option valuation model and Monte Carlo valuation model, and is expensed in the financial statements over the service period. The input assumptions used in determining fair value are the expected life, expected volatility, risk-free rate and expected dividend yield. For performance share units, the fair market value is calculated for the two component goals at the date of grant: adjusted operational earnings per share and relative total shareholder return. The fair values for the earnings per share goal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the fair market value of the shares at the time of the award, discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the performance share units during the vesting period. The fair value for the relative total shareholder return goal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo valuation model. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. New Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of January 1, 2023. 37 Economic and Market Factors The Company is aware that its products are used in an environment where, for more than a decade, policymakers, consumers and businesses have expressed concerns about the rising cost of healthcare. In response to these concerns, the Company has a long-standing policy of pricing products responsibly. For the period 2012 - 2022, in the U.S., the weighted average compound annual growth rate of the Company’s net price increases for healthcare products (prescription and over-the-counter drugs, hospital and professional products) was below the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI). The Company operates in certain countries where the economic conditions continue to present significant challenges. The Company continues to monitor these situations and take appropriate actions. Inflation rates continue to have an effect on worldwide economies and, consequently, on the way companies operate. The Company has accounted for operations in Argentina and Venezuela as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. Beginning in the fiscal second quarter of 2022, the Company accounted for operations in Turkey as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. This did not have a material impact to the Company's results in the period. In the face of increasing costs, the Company strives to maintain its profit margins through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price increases. Russia-Ukraine War Although the long-term implications of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine are difficult to predict at this time, the financial impact of the conflict in the fiscal 2022, including accounts receivable or inventory reserves, was not material. As of both the fiscal years ending January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022, the business of the Company’s Ukraine subsidiaries represented less than 1% of the Company’s consolidated assets and revenues. As of both the fiscal years ending January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022, the business of the Company’s Russian subsidiaries represented less than 1% of the Company’s consolidated assets and represented 1% of revenues. In early March, the Company took steps to suspend all advertising, enrollment in clinical trials, and any additional investment in Russia. Additionally, at the end of March, the Company made the decision to suspend supply of personal care products in Russia. The Company continues to supply its other products as patients rely on many of the products for healthcare purposes. The Company is exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. A 1% change in the value of the U.S. Dollar as compared to all foreign currencies in which the Company had sales, income or expense in 2022 would have increased or decreased the translation of foreign sales by approximately $0.5 billion and net income by approximately $0.1 billion. Governments around the world consider various proposals to make changes to tax laws, which may include increasing or decreasing existing statutory tax rates. In connection with various government initiatives, companies are required to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in other countries. A change in statutory tax rate in any country would result in the revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the period in which the new tax law is enacted. This change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The Company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the countries where it operates. Changes to the statutory tax rate may occur at any time, and any related expense or benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted. The Company faces various worldwide healthcare changes that may continue to result in pricing pressures that include healthcare cost containment and government legislation relating to sales, promotions, pricing and reimbursement of healthcare products. Changes in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of healthcare products and services, including delaying medical procedures, rationing prescription medications, reducing the frequency of physician visits and foregoing healthcare insurance coverage, as a result of the current global economic downturn, may continue to impact the Company’s businesses. The Company also operates in an environment increasingly hostile to intellectual property rights. Firms have filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications or Biosimilar Biological Product Applications with the U.S. FDA or otherwise challenged the coverage and/or validity of the Company's patents, seeking to market generic or biosimilar forms of many of the Company’s key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. In the event the Company is not successful in defending the patent claims challenged in the resulting lawsuits, generic or biosimilar versions of the products at issue will be introduced to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for those products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. There is also a risk that one or more competitors could launch a generic or biosimilar version of the product at issue following regulatory approval even though one or more valid patents are in place. Legal Proceedings Johnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial, employment, indemnification and other matters; governmental investigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. The Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of January 1, 2023, the Company has determined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal issue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based 38 on new information and further developments in accordance with ASC 450-20-25. For these and other litigation and regulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors including, among other things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and unpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements; complexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. To the extent adverse awards, judgments or verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated. In the Company's opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with counsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company's balance sheet, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position. However, the resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and cash flows for that period. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further information regarding legal proceedings.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company). Intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated. Columns and rows within tables may not add due to rounding. Percentages have been calculated using actual, non-rounded figures. Description of the Company and Business Segments The Company has approximately 152,700 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the healthcare field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world and its primary focus is on products related to human health and well-being. The Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer Health, Pharmaceutical and MedTech. The Consumer Health segment includes a broad range of products used in the Baby Care, Oral Care, Skin Health/Beauty, Over-the-Counter pharmaceutical, Women’s Health and Wound Care markets. These products are marketed to the general public and sold online (eCommerce) and to retail outlets and distributors throughout the world. The Pharmaceutical segment is focused on the following therapeutic areas, including Immunology, Infectious diseases, Neuroscience, Oncology, Pulmonary Hypertension, and Cardiovascular and Metabolic diseases. Products in this segment are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers, distributors, hospitals and healthcare professionals for prescription use. The MedTech segment includes a broad portfolio of products used in the Orthopaedic, Surgery, Interventional Solutions (cardiovascular and neurovascular) and Vision fields. These products are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics. In November 2021, the Company announced its intention to separate the Company’s Consumer Health business (Kenvue as the name for the planned New Consumer Health Company), with the intention to create a new, publicly traded company by the end of the fiscal year 2023. New Accounting Standards Recently Adopted Accounting Standards There were no new material accounting standards adopted in fiscal 2022. Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Adopted as of January 1, 2023 ASU 2022-04: Liabilities-Supplier Finance Programs (Topic 405-50) – Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations This update requires that a buyer in a supplier finance program disclose additional information about the program to allow financial statement users to better understand the effect of the programs on an entity’s working capital, liquidity, and cash flows. This update will be effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, except for the amendment on roll forward information, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this update on its disclosures and will adopt this standard in the fiscal first quarter of 2023. Cash Equivalents The Company classifies all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of three months or less from date of purchase as cash equivalents and all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of greater than three months from the date of purchase as current marketable securities. The Company has a policy of making investments only with commercial institutions that have at least an investment grade credit rating. The Company invests its cash primarily in government securities and obligations, corporate debt securities, money market funds and reverse repurchase agreements (RRAs). RRAs are collateralized by deposits in the form of Government Securities and Obligations for an amount not less than 102 % of their value. The Company does not record an asset or liability as the Company is not permitted to sell or repledge the associated collateral. The Company has a policy that the collateral has at least an A (or equivalent) credit rating. The Company utilizes a third party custodian to manage the exchange of funds and ensure that collateral received is maintained at 102 % of the value of the RRAs on a daily basis. RRAs with stated maturities of greater than three months from the date of purchase are classified as marketable securities. Investments Investments classified as held to maturity investments are reported at amortized cost and realized gains or losses are reported in earnings. Investments classified as available-for-sale debt securities are carried at estimated fair value with unrealized gains and 46 losses recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Available-for-sale securities available for current operations are classified as current assets otherwise, they are classified as long term. Management determines the appropriate classification of its investment in debt and equity securities at the time of purchase and re-evaluates such determination at each balance sheet date. The Company reviews its investments for impairment and adjusts these investments to fair value through earnings, as required. Property, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. The Company utilizes the straight-line method of depreciation over the estimated useful lives of the assets: Building and building equipment 30 years Land and leasehold improvements 10 - 20 years Machinery and equipment 2 - 13 years The Company capitalizes certain computer software and development costs, included in machinery and equipment, when incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use. Capitalized software costs are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the software, which generally range from 3 to 8 years. The Company reviews long-lived assets to assess recoverability using undiscounted cash flows. When certain events or changes in operating or economic conditions occur, an impairment assessment may be performed on the recoverability of the carrying value of these assets. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset’s fair value and its carrying value. If quoted market prices are not available, the Company will estimate fair value using a discounted value of estimated future cash flows. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the goods to customers. The Company's global payment terms are typically between 30 to 90 days. Provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns, discounts to customers and governmental clawback provisions are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales. The liability is recognized within Accrued Rebates, Returns, and Promotions on the consolidated balance sheet. Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants, as well as market conditions, including consideration of competitor pricing. Rebates are estimated based on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served. A significant portion of the liability related to rebates is from the sale of the Company's pharmaceutical products within the U.S., primarily t he Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid programs, which amounted to $ 9.6 billion and $ 7.7 billion as of January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022, respectively. The Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through the analysis of wholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally generated information. Sales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals. Sales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in the field, or in specific areas, product recall. The sales returns reserve is based on historical return trends by product and by market as a percent to gross sales. In accordance with the Company’s accounting policies, the Company generally issues credit to customers for returned goods. The Company’s sales returns reserves are accounted for in accordance with the U.S. GAAP guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns reserves are recorded at full sales value. Sales returns in the Consumer Health and Pharmaceutical segments are almost exclusively not resalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the MedTech segment are typically resalable but are not material. The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products. The sales returns reserve for the total Company has been approximately 1.0 % of annual net trade sales during each of the fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020. Promotional programs, such as product listing allowances and cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in the same period as related sales. Continuing promotional programs include coupons and volume-based sales incentive programs. The redemption cost of consumer coupons is based on historical redemption experience by product and value. Volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales volumes for the incentive period and are recorded as products are sold. These arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred or recorded as a reduction of revenue. The Company also earns profit-share payments through collaborative arrangements for certain products, which are included in sales to customers. Profit-share payments were less than 2.0 % of the total revenues in fiscal year 2022 and less than 3.0 % of the total revenues in fiscal years 2021 and 2020 and are included in sales to customers. 47 See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further disaggregation of revenue. Shipping and Handling Shipping and handling costs incurred were $ 1.1 billion, $ 1.1 billion and $ 1.0 billion in fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and are included in selling, marketing and administrative expense. The amount of revenue received for shipping and handling is less than 1.0 % of sales to customers for all periods presented. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value determined by the first-in, first-out method. Intangible Assets and Goodwill The authoritative literature on U.S. GAAP requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives be assessed annually for impairment. The Company completed its annual impairment test for 2022 in the fiscal fourth quarter. Future impairment tests will be performed annually in the fiscal fourth quarter, or sooner if warranted. Purchased in-process research and development is accounted for as an indefinite lived intangible asset until the underlying project is completed, at which point the intangible asset will be accounted for as a definite lived intangible asset. If warranted the purchased in-process research and development could be written off or partially impaired depending on the underlying program. Intangible assets that have finite useful lives continue to be amortized over their useful lives, and are reviewed for impairment when warranted by economic conditions. See Note 5 for further details on Intangible Assets and Goodwill. Financial Instruments As required by U.S. GAAP, all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Fair value is the exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is a market-based measurement determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The authoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value, with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction. The Company documents all relationships between hedged items and derivatives. The overall risk management strategy includes reasons for undertaking hedge transactions and entering into derivatives. The objectives of this strategy are: (1) minimize foreign currency exposure’s impact on the Company’s financial performance; (2) protect the Company’s cash flow from adverse movements in foreign exchange rates; (3) ensure the appropriateness of financial instruments; and (4) manage the enterprise risk associated with financial institutions. See Note 6 for additional information on Financial Instruments. Leases The Company determines whether an arrangement is a lease at contract inception by establishing if the contract conveys the right to control the use of identified property, plant, or equipment for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Right of Use (ROU) Assets and Lease Liabilities for operating leases are included in Other assets , Accrued liabilities , and Other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. The ROU Assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent an obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Commitments under finance leases are not significant, and are included in Property, plant and equipment, Loans and notes payable, and Long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheet. ROU Assets and Lease Liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of all minimum lease payments over the lease term. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments, when the implicit rate is not readily determinable. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease. These options are included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company has elected the following policy elections on adoption: use of portfolio approach on leases of assets under master service agreements, exclusion of short term leases on the balance sheet, and not separating lease and non-lease components. The Company primarily has operating lease for space, vehicles, manufacturing equipment and data processing equipment. The ROU asset pertaining to operating leases was $ 1.1 billion and $ 0.9 billion in fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. The lease liability was $ 1.3 billion and $ 1.0 billion in fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. The operating lease costs were $ 0.3 billion in fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities were $ 0.3 billion in fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Product Liability Accruals for product liability claims are recorded, on an undiscounted basis, when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information and actuarially determined estimates where applicable. The accruals are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available. The Company 48 accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to defend each matter when those costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. To the extent adverse verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals in the self insurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated. Research and Development Research and development expenses are expensed as incurred in accordance with ASC 730, Research and Development. Upfront and milestone payments made to third parties in connection with research and development collaborations are expensed as incurred up to the point of regulatory approval. Payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related product. Amounts capitalized for such payments are included in other intangibles, net of accumulated amortization. The Company enters into collaborative arrangements, typically with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies, to develop and commercialize drug candidates or intellectual property. These arrangements typically involve two (or more) parties who are active participants in the collaboration and are exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of the activities. These collaborations usually involve various activities by one or more parties, including research and development, marketing and selling and distribution. Often, these collaborations require upfront, milestone and royalty or profit share payments, contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development. Amounts due from collaborative partners related to development activities are generally reflected as a reduction of research and development expense because the performance of contract development services is not central to the Company’s operations. In general, the income statement presentation for these collaborations is as follows: Nature/Type of Collaboration Statement of Earnings Presentation Third-party sale of product & profit share payments received Sales to customers Royalties/milestones paid to collaborative partner (post-regulatory approval)* Cost of products sold Royalties received from collaborative partner Other income (expense), net Upfront payments & milestones paid to collaborative partner (pre-regulatory approval) Research and development expense Research and development payments to collaborative partner Research and development expense Research and development payments received from collaborative partner or government entity Reduction of Research and development expense * Milestones are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to cost of products sold over the useful life. For all years presented, there was no individual project that represented greater than 5 % of the total annual consolidated research and development expense. The Company has a number of products and compounds developed in collaboration with strategic partners including XARELTO, co-developed with Bayer HealthCare AG and IMBRUVICA, developed in collaboration and co-marketed with Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie company. Separately, the Company has a number of licensing arrangements for products and compounds including DARZALEX, licensed from Genmab A/S. Advertising Costs associated with advertising are expensed in the year incurred and are included in selling, marketing and administrative expenses. Advertising expenses worldwide, which comprised television, radio, print media and Internet advertising, were $ 2.1 billion, $ 2.7 billion and $ 2.1 billion in fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Income Taxes Income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and include the results of any difference between U.S. GAAP accounting and tax reporting, recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities. The Company estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on enacted tax regulations and rates. Future changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. The Company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company follows U.S. GAAP which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Management believes that changes in these estimates would not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial position. In 2017, the United States enacted into law new U.S. tax legislation, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). This law included provisions for a comprehensive overhaul of the corporate income tax code, including a reduction of the statutory corporate tax rate from 35 % to 21 %, effective on January 1, 2018. The TCJA included a provision for a tax on all previously 49 undistributed earnings of U.S. companies located in foreign jurisdictions. Undistributed earnings in the form of cash and cash equivalents were taxed at a rate of 15.5 % and all other earnings were taxed at a rate of 8.0 %. This tax is payable over 8 years and will not accrue interest. These payments began in 2018 and will continue through 2025. The remaining balance at the end of the 2022 was approximately $ 6.1 billion, of which $ 4.6 billion is classified as noncurrent and reflected as “Long-term taxes payable” on the Company’s balance sheet. The balance of this account is related to receivables from tax authorities not expected to be received in the next 12 months. The TCJA also includes provisions for a tax on global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI). GILTI is described as the excess of a U.S. shareholder’s total net foreign income over a deemed return on tangible assets, as provided by the TCJA. In January 2018, the FASB issued guidance that allows companies to elect as an accounting policy whether to record the tax effects of GILTI in the period the tax liability is generated (i.e., “period cost”) or provide for deferred tax assets and liabilities related to basis differences that exist and are expected to effect the amount of GILTI inclusion in future years upon reversal (i.e., “deferred method”). The Company has elected to account for GILTI under the deferred method. The deferred tax amounts recorded are based on the evaluation of temporary differences that are expected to reverse as GILTI is incurred in future periods. The Company has recorded deferred tax liabilities on all undistributed earnings prior to December 31, 2017 from its international subsidiaries. The Company has not provided deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings subsequent to January 1, 2018 from certain international subsidiaries where the earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. The Company intends to continue to reinvest these earnings in those international operations. If the Company decides at a later date to repatriate these earnings to the U.S., the Company would be required to provide for the net tax effects on these amounts. The Company estimates that the tax effect of this repatriation would be approximately $ 0.5 billion under currently enacted tax laws and regulations and at current currency exchange rates. This amount does not include the possible benefit of U.S. foreign tax credits, which may substantially offset this cost. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding income taxes. Net Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities were exercised or converted into common stock using the treasury stock method. Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Estimates are used when accounting for sales discounts, rebates, allowances and incentives, product liabilities, income taxes, withholding taxes, depreciation, amortization, employee benefits, contingencies and intangible asset and liability valuations. Actual results may or may not differ from those estimates. The Company follows the provisions of U.S. GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies. A liability is recorded when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. The best estimate of a loss within a range is accrued; however, if no estimate in the range is better than any other, the minimum amount is accrued. Annual Closing Date The Company follows the concept of a fiscal year, which ends on the Sunday nearest to the end of the month of December. Normally each fiscal year consists of 52 weeks, but every five or six years the fiscal year consists of 53 weeks, and therefore includes additional shipping days, as was the case in fiscal year 2020, and will be the case again in fiscal year 2026. Reclassification Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation. 50 2. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Current Marketable Securities At the end of the fiscal year 2022 and 2021, cash, cash equivalents and current marketable securities were comprised of: (Dollars in Millions) 2022 Carrying Amount Unrecognized Loss Estimated Fair Value Cash & Cash Equivalents Current Marketable Securities Cash $ 4,926 — 4,926 4,926 — U.S. Reverse repurchase agreements 1,419 — 1,419 1,419 — Corporate debt securities (1) 873 ( 1 ) 872 — 873 Money market funds 5,368 — 5,368 5,368 — Time deposits (1) 446 — 446 446 — Subtotal $ 13,032 ( 1 ) 13,031 12,159 873 U.S. Gov't Securities $ 9,959 ( 28 ) 9,931 1,922 8,009 U.S. Gov't Agencies 210 ( 5 ) 205 — 205 Corporate and other debt securities 352 ( 1 ) 351 46 305 Subtotal available for sale (2) $ 10,521 ( 34 ) 10,487 1,968 8,519 Total cash, cash equivalents and current marketable securities $ 14,127 9,392 (Dollars in Millions) 2021 Carrying Amount Unrecognized Loss Estimated Fair Value Cash & Cash Equivalents Current Marketable Securities Cash $ 2,936 — 2,936 2,936 — Non-U.S. Sovereign Securities (1) 1,006 — 1,006 90 916 U.S. Reverse repurchase agreements 1,659 — 1,659 1,659 — Corporate debt securities (1) 3,479 ( 1 ) 3,478 200 3,279 Money market funds 1,901 — 1,901 1,901 — Time deposits (1) 900 — 900 900 — Subtotal 11,881 ( 1 ) 11,880 7,686 4,195 U.S. Gov't Securities $ 19,485 ( 4 ) 19,481 6,785 12,696 Corporate and other debt securities 246 — 246 16 230 Subtotal available for sale (2) $ 19,731 ( 4 ) 19,727 6,801 12,926 Total cash, cash equivalents and current marketable securities $ 14,487 17,121 (1) Held to maturity investments are reported at amortized cost and realized gains or losses are reported in earnings. (2) Available for sale debt securities are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported net of taxes in other comprehensive income. Fair value of government securities and obligations and corporate debt securities were estimated using quoted broker prices and significant other observable inputs. 51 The contractual maturities of the available for sale debt securities at January 1, 2023 are as follows: (Dollars in Millions) Cost Basis Fair Value Due within one year $ 10,430 10,399 Due after one year through five years 91 88 Due after five years through ten years — — Total debt securities $ 10,521 10,487 The Company invests its excess cash in both deposits with major banks throughout the world and other high-quality money market instruments. The Company has a policy of making investments only with commercial institutions that have at least an investment grade credit rating. 3. Inventories At the end of fiscal years 2022 and 2021, inventories were comprised of: (Dollars in Millions) 2022 2021 Raw materials and supplies $ 2,070 1,592 Goods in process 1,700 2,287 Finished goods 8,713 6,508 Total inventories $ 12,483 10,387 4. Property, Plant and Equipment At the end of fiscal years 2022 and 2021, property, plant and equipment at cost and accumulated depreciation were: (Dollars in Millions) 2022 2021 Land and land improvements $ 859 884 Buildings and building equipment 12,989 12,882 Machinery and equipment 30,431 29,774 Construction in progress 4,974 4,139 Total property, plant and equipment, gross $ 49,253 47,679 Less accumulated depreciation 29,450 28,717 Total property, plant and equipment, net $ 19,803 18,962 The Company capitalizes interest expense as part of the cost of construction of facilities and equipment. Interest expense capitalized in fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $ 49 million, $ 49 million and $ 63 million, respectively. Depreciation expense, including the amortization of capitalized interest in fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $ 2.7 billion, $ 2.7 billion and $ 2.6 billion, respectively. Upon retirement or other disposal of property, plant and equipment, the costs and related amounts of accumulated depreciation or amortization are eliminated from the asset and accumulated depreciation accounts, respectively. The difference, if any, between the net asset value and the proceeds are recorded in earnings. 52 5. Intangible Assets and Goodwill At the end of fiscal years 2022 and 2021, the gross and net amounts of intangible assets were: (Dollars in Millions) 2022 2021 Intangible assets with definite lives: Patents and trademarks — gross $ 44,012 38,572 Less accumulated amortization ( 22,266 ) ( 20,088 ) Patents and trademarks — net (1) $ 21,746 18,484 Customer relationships and other intangibles — gross $ 22,987 23,011 Less accumulated amortization ( 12,901 ) ( 11,925 ) Customer relationships and other intangibles — net (2) $ 10,086 11,086 Intangible assets with indefinite lives: Trademarks $ 6,807 6,985 Purchased in-process research and development (3) 9,686 9,837 Total intangible assets with indefinite lives $ 16,493 16,822 Total intangible assets — net $ 48,325 46,392 (1) The change was primarily related to the intangible assets acquired with the acquisition of Abiomed, Inc. which was partially offset by amortization expense of previously existing intangible assets and the result of currency translation effects. (2) The majority is comprised of customer relationships (3) The reduction was primarily related to an intangible asset impairment charge of approximately $ 0.8 billion recorded in the fiscal year 2022 related to an in-process research and development asset, bermekimab (JnJ-77474462), an investigational drug for the treatment of Atopic Dermatitis (AD) and Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS) acquired with the acquisition of XBiotech, Inc. in the fiscal year 2020. Additional information regarding efficacy of the AD and HS indications became available which led the Company to the decision to terminate the development of bermekimab for AD and HS. An additional reduction of $ 0.7 billion was driven by Monarch assets that reached commercialization and are now classified as having definite lives. This was partially offset by approximately $ 1.1 billion of IPR&D acquired with Abiomed, Inc. Goodwill as of January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022, as allocated by segment of business, was as follows: (Dollars in Millions) Consumer Health Pharmaceutical MedTech Total Goodwill at January 3, 2021 $ 10,336 11,009 15,048 36,393 Goodwill, related to acquisitions — — — — Goodwill, related to divestitures ( 9 ) — — ( 9 ) Currency translation/other ( 517 ) ( 429 ) ( 192 ) ( 1,138 ) Goodwill at January 2, 2022 $ 9,810 10,580 14,856 35,246 Goodwill, related to acquisitions — — 11,056 11,056 Goodwill, related to divestitures — — — — Currency translation/other ( 626 ) ( 396 ) ( 49 ) ( 1,071 ) Goodwill at January 1, 2023 $ 9,184 10,184 25,863 45,231 The weighted average amortization period for patents and trademarks is 12 years. The weighted average amortization period for customer relationships and other intangible assets is 21 years. The amortization expense of amortizable assets included in Cost of products sold was $ 4.3 billion, $ 4.7 billion and $ 4.7 billion before tax, for the fiscal years ended January 1, 2023, January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021, respectively. Intangible asset write-downs are included in Other (income) expense, net. The estimated amortization expense for approved products, before tax, for the five succeeding years is approximately: (Dollars in Millions) 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 $ 4,600 4,400 3,600 3,000 2,400 See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to acquisitions and divestitures. 53 6. Fair Value Measurements The Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to manage its exposure to the variability of cash flows, primarily related to the foreign exchange rate changes of future intercompany products and third-party purchases of materials denominated in a foreign currency. The Company uses cross currency interest rate swaps to manage currency risk primarily related to borrowings. Both types of derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges. Additionally, the Company primarily uses interest rate swaps as an instrument to manage interest rate risk related to fixed rate borrowings. These derivatives are designated as fair value hedges. The Company uses cross currency interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges. Additionally, the Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to offset its exposure to certain foreign currency assets and liabilities. These forward foreign exchange contracts are not designated as hedges and therefore, changes in the fair values of these derivatives are recognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the related foreign currency assets and liabilities. In the fiscal fourth quarter of 2022, the Company entered into forward starting interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling $ 2.4 billion in contemplation of hedging interest rate risk associated with long-term financing for the Consumer Health segment separation. These forward starting interest rate swaps are not designated as hedges and therefore, changes in the fair values of these derivatives are recognized in earnings. At the end of the fiscal year 2022, the changes in fair value was not material and therefore not included in the table below. The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes, or that contain credit risk related contingent features. The Company maintains credit support agreements (CSA) with certain derivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on respective credit ratings and netting agreements. As of January 1, 2023, the total amount of cash collateral paid by the Company under the CSA amounted to $ 0.8 billion net, related to net investment and cash flow hedges. On an ongoing basis, the Company monitors counter-party credit ratings. The Company considers credit non-performance risk to be low, because the Company primarily enters into agreements with commercial institutions that have at least an investment grade credit rating. Refer to the table on significant financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value contained in this footnote for receivables and payables with these commercial institutions. As of January 1, 2023, the Company had notional amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange contracts, cross currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps of $ 43.3 billion, $ 36.2 billion and $ 12.4 billion, respectively. As of January 2, 2022, the Company had notional amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange contracts, cross currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps of $ 45.8 billion, $ 37.4 billion and $ 10.0 billion, respectively. All derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction. The designation as a cash flow hedge is made at the entrance date of the derivative contract. At inception, all derivatives are expected to be highly effective. Foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges are accounted for under the forward method and all gains/losses associated with these contracts will be recognized in the income statement when the hedged item impacts earnings. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income until the underlying transaction affects earnings, and are then reclassified to earnings in the same account as the hedged transaction. Gains and losses associated with interest rate swaps and changes in fair value of hedged debt attributable to changes in interest rates are recorded to interest expense in the period in which they occur. Gains and losses on net investment hedges are accounted through the currency translation account within accumulated other comprehensive income. The portion excluded from effectiveness testing is recorded through interest (income) expense using the spot method. On an ongoing basis, the Company assesses whether each derivative continues to be highly effective in offsetting changes of hedged items. If and when a derivative is no longer expected to be highly effective, hedge accounting is discontinued. The Company designated its Euro denominated notes issued in May 2016 with due dates ranging from 2022 to 2035 as a net investment hedge of the Company's investments in certain of its international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their functional currency in order to reduce the volatility caused by changes in exchange rates. As of January 1, 2023, the balance of deferred net loss on derivatives included in accumulated other comprehensive income was $ 230 million after-tax. For additional information, see the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and Note 13. The Company expects that substantially all of the amounts related to forward foreign exchange contracts will be reclassified into earnings over the next 12 months as a result of transactions that are expected to occur over that period. The maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging transaction exposure is 18 months, excluding interest rate contracts and net investment hedges. The amount ultimately realized in earnings may differ as foreign exchange rates change.

There were offsetting impacts of $ 142 million and $ 422 million, respectively, of changes in the fair value reflected in net income due to changes in observable prices and gains on the disposal of investments. The impact in fiscal year 2021, was driven by the gain on disposal of the Grail investment. In fiscal year 2022, the Company sold all of its equity investments in argenx SE for proceeds of $ 0.6 billion. Fair value is the exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is a market-based measurement determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. In accordance with ASC 820, a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels within the hierarchy are described below with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest. The fair value of a derivative financial instrument (i.e., forward foreign exchange contracts, interest rate contracts) is the aggregation by currency of all future cash flows discounted to its present value at the prevailing market interest rates and subsequently converted to the U.S. Dollar at the current spot foreign exchange rate. The Company does not believe that fair values of these derivative instruments materially differ from the amounts that could be realized upon settlement or maturity, or that the changes in fair value will have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position. The Company also holds equity investments which are classified as Level 1 and debt securities which are classified as Level 2. The Company holds acquisition related contingent liabilities based upon certain regulatory and commercial events, which are classified as Level 3, whose values are determined using discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques for which the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimations. The following three levels of inputs are used to measure fair value: Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. Level 2 — Significant other observable inputs. Level 3 — Significant unobservable inputs. 57 The Company’s significant financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value as of the fiscal year ended January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022 were as follows: 2022 2021 (Dollars in Millions) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Total (1) Derivatives designated as hedging instruments: Assets: Forward foreign exchange contracts $ — 629 — 629 540 Interest rate contracts (2) — 1,534 — 1,534 796 Total $ — 2,163 — 2,163 1,336 Liabilities: Forward foreign exchange contracts — 511 — 511 881 Interest rate contracts (2) — 2,778 — 2,778 979 Total $ — 3,289 — 3,289 1,860 Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments: Assets: Forward foreign exchange contracts $ — 38 — 38 24 Liabilities: Forward foreign exchange contracts — 68 — 68 28 Available For Sale Other Investments: Equity investments (3) 576 — — 576 1,884 Debt securities (4) — 10,487 — 10,487 19,727 Other Liabilities Contingent Consideration (5) $ 1,120 1,120 533 Gross to Net Derivative Reconciliation 2022 2021 (Dollars in Millions) Total Gross Assets $ 2,201 1,360 Credit Support Agreement (CSA) ( 2,176 ) ( 1,285 ) Total Net Asset 25 75 Total Gross Liabilities 3,357 1,888 Credit Support Agreement (CSA) ( 3,023 ) ( 1,855 ) Total Net Liabilities $ 334 33 Summarized information about changes in liabilities for contingent consideration is as follows: 2022 2021 2020 (Dollars in Millions) Beginning Balance $ 533 633 1,715 Changes in estimated fair value (6) ( 194 ) ( 52 ) ( 1,089 ) Additions (7) 792 — 106 Payments ( 11 ) ( 48 ) ( 99 ) Ending Balance $ 1,120 533 633 (1) 2021 assets and liabilities are all classified as Level 2 with the exception of equity investments of $ 1,884 million, which are classified as Level 1 and contingent consideration of $ 533 million, classified as Level 3.

Includes $ 4 million, $ 13 million and $ 39 million classified as current liabilities as of January 1, 2023, January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021, respectively. (6) Ongoing fair value adjustment amounts are recorded primarily in Research and Development expense. The Company recorded a contingent consideration reversal of $ 1,148 million in 2020 related to the timing of certain developmental milestones associated with the Auris Health acquisition. The reversal of the contingent consideration was recorded in Other income and expense. (7) In fiscal year 2022, the Company recorded $ 704 million of contingent consideration related to Abiomed.

Fair value of the long-term debt was estimated using market prices, which were corroborated by quoted broker prices and significant other observable inputs. The Company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous banks worldwide. In September 2022, the Company secured a new 364-day Credit Facility of $ 10 billion, which expires on September 7, 2023. In November 2022, the Company secured an additional 364-day Credit Facility of $ 10 billion, which expires on November 21, 2023. Interest charged on borrowings under the credit line agreement is based on either the Term SOFR Reference Rate or other applicable market rates as allowed under the terms of the agreement, plus applicable margins. Commitment fees under the agreements are not material. Throughout fiscal years 2022 and 2021, the Company continued to have access to liquidity through the commercial paper market. Short-term borrowings and the current portion of long-term debt amounted to approximately $ 12.8 billion and $ 3.8 billion at the end of fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. The current portion of the long term debt was $ 1.6 billion and $ 2.1 billion in 2022 and 2021, respectively, and the remainder is commercial paper and local borrowing by international subsi diaries. The current debt balance as of January 1, 2023 includes $ 11.2 billion of commercial paper which has a weighted average interest rate of 4.23 % and a weighted average maturity of approximately two months .

International operations reflect the impacts of operations in jurisdictions with statutory tax rates different than the U.S., particularly Ireland, Switzerland and Puerto Rico, which is a favorable impact on the effective tax rate as compared with the U.S. statutory rate. The 2021 amounts include the reorganization of international subsidiaries; the 2020 amounts include the impact of the new tax legislation enactment in Switzerland, both of which are further described below. (2) Includes the impact of the GILTI tax, the Foreign-Derived Intangible Income deduction and other foreign income that is taxable under the U.S. tax code. The 2022 amount includes the impact of certain provisions of the 2017 TCJA that became effective in fiscal 2022. The 2021 amounts include the reorganization of international subsidiaries; the 2020 amounts include the impact of the new tax legislation enactment in Switzerland, both of which are further described below. (3) Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation. The fiscal year 2022 effective tax rate increased 9.1 % as compared to the fiscal year 2021 effective tax rate. As part of the planned separation of the Company’s Consumer Health business, the Company has recognized approximately $ 0.5 billion in net incremental tax costs in fiscal year 2022, which increased the 2022 effective tax rate by approximately 2.2 %. Additionally, the Company recorded certain non-recurring favorable tax items in fiscal year 2021 which resulted in an unfavorable impact to the Company’s fiscal 2022 effective tax rate when compared to the prior fiscal year. These items are described below. The Company’s 2022 tax rate also benefited from certain provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that became effective in fiscal 2022, the impairment of bermekimab for AD and HS IPR&D (for further information see Note 5 of the 2022 10-K Consolidated Financial Statements) and changes in the fair value of securities in the Company’s investment portfolio, both recorded at the U.S. statutory rate. The fiscal year 2021 tax rate decreased by 2.5 % compared to the fiscal year 2020 tax rate, which was primarily driven by the following items. In fiscal year 2021, the Company reorganized the ownership structure of certain wholly-owned international subsidiaries. As part of this reorganization, the Company increased the tax basis of certain assets to fair value in accordance with applicable local regulations. The net impact of this restructuring was approximately $ 0.6 billion net benefit or 2.7 % benefit to the Company’s annual effective tax rate, comprised of the following items: • approximately $ 2.3 billion of local deferred tax assets to record the remeasurement of the tax basis of these assets to fair value, this benefit has been reflected as “International Operations” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation. • approximately $ 1.7 billion of U.S. deferred tax expense relating to the GILTI deferred tax liability resulting from the remeasurement of these deferred tax assets. This expense has been reflected as “U.S. tax on international income” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation. Also, in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2021, the Company recognized a loss on certain U.S. affiliates related to the previously impaired book value of certain intangibles, which reduced the 2021 tax rate by approximately 1.3 % which is reflected as a “Tax benefits from loss on capital assets” on the effective tax rate reconciliation. Additionally other fiscal 2021 impacts to the rate were primarily driven by litigation and acquisition related items as follows: 62 • the Company accrued additional legal expenses, of approximately $ 1.6 billion for talc at an effective tax rate of 23.5 % and $ 0.8 billion for Risperdal Gynecomastia settlements at an effective tax rate of 16.4 % (See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details). • the Company recorded a partial IPR&D charge of $ 0.9 billion for the Ottava intangible asset (acquired with the Auris Health acquisition in 2019) at an effective rate of 22.4 %. In fiscal year 2019, Switzerland enacted the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (TRAF) and became effective for fiscal year 2020. The Federal transitional provisions of TRAF allow companies, under certain conditions, to adjust the tax basis in certain assets to fair value (i.e., “step-up”) to be depreciated and amortized resulting in an incremental Swiss tax deduction over the transitional period. TRAF also provides for parameters which enable the Swiss cantons to establish localized tax rates and regulations for companies. The new cantonal tax parameters include favorable tax benefits for patents and additional research and development tax deductions. The cantonal transitional provisions of TRAF allowed companies to elect either 1) tax basis step-up similar to the Federal transition benefit or 2) alternative statutory tax rate for a period not to exceed 5 years. The Company has operations located in various Swiss cantons. During the fiscal year 2020, the final canton where the Company maintains significant operations enacted TRAF legislation. Additionally, the Company received rulings from the Swiss Federal and cantonal tax authorities in the remaining jurisdictions where it has significant operations. These rulings resulted in the Company revising its estimate on the tax basis adjustment (i.e., “step-up”) for its assets and as a result, the Company recorded additional deferred tax benefits in 2020. The Company recognized a net benefit in the fiscal year 2020 for Swiss Tax Reform of approximately $ 0.4 billion or 2.6 % benefit to the Company’s annual effective tax rate, comprised of the following items: • approximately $ 0.3 billion tax benefit relating to the remeasurement of Swiss deferred tax assets and liabilities for the change in the Federal and cantonal tax rates, where enactment occurred in the fiscal year 2020; this benefit has been reflected as “International Operations” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation. • a $ 450 million deferred tax asset related to the estimated value of a Federal tax basis step-up of the Company’s Swiss subsidiaries’ assets as described above; this benefit has been reflected as “International Operations” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation. • approximately $ 0.3 billion of U.S. deferred tax expense relating to the GILTI deferred tax liability resulting from the remeasurement of the Swiss deferred tax assets and liabilities in the fiscal year 2020. This benefit has been reflected as “U.S. tax on international income” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation. The Company does not expect to receive future rulings regarding the transitional provisions of TRAF. Also, in the fiscal year 2020, the Company recognized a capital loss on certain U.S. affiliates related to the previously impaired book value of certain intangibles, which reduced the 2020 tax rate by approximately 1.2 % which is reflected as a “Tax benefits from loss on capital assets” on the effective tax rate reconciliation. In addition, in the fiscal year 2020, the Company had lower income in higher tax jurisdictions, primarily driven by: • the impact of the accrual of litigation costs related to talc for $ 4.0 billion which reduced the U.S. earnings before taxes at an effective tax rate of 23.5 %; • the accrual of additional legal costs, including an additional $ 1.0 billion associated with a revised agreement in principle to settle opioid litigation at an effective tax rate of 21.4 % The Company also reduced the contingent consideration liability related to the Auris Health acquisition in 2019 and reversed some of its unrecognized tax benefits due to the completion of several years of tax examinations in certain jurisdictions during the fiscal year 2020. 63 Temporary differences and carryforwards at the end of fiscal years 2022 and 2021 were as follows: 2022 Deferred Tax 2021 Deferred Tax (1) (Dollars in Millions) Asset Liability Asset Liability Employee related obligations $ 725 1,244 Stock based compensation 687 679 Depreciation of property, plant and equipment ( 858 ) ( 876 ) Goodwill and intangibles ( 4,271 ) (3) ( 2,659 ) (2) R&D capitalized for tax 2,611 1,664 Reserves & liabilities 2,761 2,882 Income reported for tax purposes 2,045 2,566 Net realizable operating loss carryforwards (4) 1,260 1,720 Undistributed foreign earnings 1,565 ( 1,693 ) 1,015 ( 1,461 ) Global intangible low-taxed income ( 3,547 ) ( 4,853 ) Miscellaneous international 1,053 ( 65 ) 870 ( 39 ) Miscellaneous U.S. 476 ( 16 ) Total deferred income taxes $ 13,183 ( 10,434 ) 12,640 ( 9,904 ) (1) Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation. (2) Amount is inclusive of the $ 2.3 billion deferred tax asset established as part of the reorganized ownership structure of certain wholly-owned international subsidiaries, as previously described. (3) Amount is inclusive of the $ 1.8 billion deferred tax liability due to the acquisition of Abiomed. (4) Net of valuation allowances of $ 0.9 billion in both 2022 and 2021. The Company has wholly-owned international subsidiaries that have cumulative net losses. The Company believes that it is more likely than not that these subsidiaries will generate future taxable income sufficient to utilize these deferred tax assets. However, in certain jurisdictions, valuation allowances have been recorded against deferred tax assets for loss carryforwards that are not more likely than not to be realized. The following table summarizes the activity related to unrecognized tax benefits: (Dollars in Millions) 2022 2021 2020 Beginning of year $ 3,323 3,373 3,853 Increases related to current year tax positions 523 242 265 Increases related to prior period tax positions 143 23 668 Decreases related to prior period tax positions ( 148 ) ( 128 ) ( 551 ) Settlements ( 1 ) ( 187 ) ( 839 ) Lapse of statute of limitations ( 11 ) — ( 23 ) End of year $ 3,829 3,323 3,373 The unrecognized tax benefits of $ 3.8 billion at January 1, 2023, if recognized, would affect the Company’s annual effective tax rate. The Company conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and currently has tax audits in progress with a number of tax authorities. With respect to the United States, the IRS has completed its audit for the tax years through 2012 and is currently auditing tax years 2013 through 2016. In the fiscal year 2020, the Company made its final payments for approximately $ 0.7 billion to the U.S. Treasury related to the final settlement of 2010-2012 tax audit liability. In other major jurisdictions where the Company conducts business, the years that remain open to tax audits go back to the year 2008. The Company believes it is possible that some tax audits may be completed over the next twelve months by taxing authorities in some jurisdictions, including in the United States. However, the Company is not able to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of any other future tax payments or change in uncertain tax positions, if any. The Company classifies liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties as long-term liabilities. Interest expense and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax expense. The Company recognized after tax interest expense of $ 139 million, $ 44 million and $ 32 million in fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The total amount of accrued interest was $ 651 million and $ 512 million in fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. 64 9. Employee Related Obligations At the end of fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, employee related obligations recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were: (Dollars in Millions) 2022 2021 Pension benefits $ 2,698 4,088 Postretirement benefits 1,734 2,069 Postemployment benefits 2,832 3,117 Deferred compensation 100 181 Total employee obligations 7,364 9,455 Less current benefits payable 597 557 Employee related obligations — non-current $ 6,767 8,898 Prepaid employee related obligations of $ 4,581 million and $ 4,436 million for 2022 and 2021, respectively, are included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 10. Pensions and Other Benefit Plans The Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit, defined contribution and termination indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide. The Company also provides post-retirement benefits, primarily healthcare, to all eligible U.S. retired employees and their dependents. Many international employees are covered by government-sponsored programs and the cost to the Company is not significant. In the U.S, non-union pension benefits for employees hired before January 1, 2015 are primarily based on the employee’s compensation during the last five years before retirement and the number of years of service (the Final Average Pay formula). U.S. pension benefits for employees hired after 2014, are calculated using a different formula based on employee compensation over total years of service (the Retirement Value formula). In January 2021, the Company announced that, effective on January 1, 2026, all eligible U.S. non-union employees, regardless of hire date, will earn benefits under the Retirement Value formula. This amendment does not affect the benefits accrued under the Final Average Pay formula for service before January 1, 2026. International subsidiaries have plans under which funds are deposited with trustees, annuities are purchased under group contracts, or reserves are provided. The Company does not fund retiree healthcare benefits in advance and has the right to modify these plans in the future. In 2022 and 2021 the Company used December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, as the measurement date for all U.S. and international retirement and other benefit plans. Net periodic benefit costs for the Company’s defined benefit retirement plans and other benefit plans for 2022, 2021 and 2020 include the following components: Retirement Plans Other Benefit Plans (Dollars in Millions) 2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 2020 Service cost $ 1,327 1,421 1,380 320 309 287 Interest cost 911 770 955 105 81 133 Expected return on plan assets ( 2,757 ) ( 2,645 ) ( 2,461 ) ( 8 ) ( 7 ) ( 7 ) Amortization of prior service cost ( 184 ) ( 181 ) 2 ( 5 ) ( 31 ) ( 31 ) Recognized actuarial losses (gains) 655 1,257 891 121 151 142 Curtailments and settlements 1 1 23 — — — Net periodic benefit cost (credit) $ ( 47 ) 623 790 533 503 524 65 The service cost component of net periodic benefit cost is presented in the same line items on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings where other employee compensation costs are reported, including Cost of products sold, Research and development expense, and Selling, marketing and administrative expenses. All other components of net periodic benefit cost are presented as part of Other (income) expense, net on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Unrecognized gains and losses for the U.S. pension plans are amortized over the average remaining future service for each plan. For plans with no active employees, they are amortized over the average life expectancy. The amortization of gains and losses for the other U.S. benefit plans is determined by using a 10 % corridor of the greater of the market value of assets or the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation. Total unamortized gains and losses in excess of the corridor are amortized over the average remaining future service. Prior service costs/benefits for the U.S. pension plans are amortized over the average remaining future service of plan participants at the time of the plan amendment. Prior service cost/benefit for the other U.S. benefit plans is amortized over the average remaining service to full eligibility age of plan participants at the time of the plan amendment. The following table represents the weighted-average actuarial assumptions: Retirement Plans Other Benefit Plans Worldwide Benefit Plans 2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 2020 Net Periodic Benefit Cost Service cost discount rate 2.46 % 2.14 2.82 2.59 2.09 3.04 Interest cost discount rate 2.80 % 2.34 3.13 2.64 2.33 3.08 Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.02 % 4.01 4.00 4.21 4.25 4.25 Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets 7.25 % 7.71 8.12 Benefit Obligation Discount rate 5.01 % 2.49 2.14 5.42 2.68 2.23 Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00 % 4.01 4.00 4.21 4.21 4.27 The Company’s discount rates are determined by considering current yield curves representing high quality, long-term fixed income instruments. The resulting discount rates are consistent with the duration of plan liabilities. The Company's methodology in determining service and interest cost uses duration specific spot rates along that yield curve to the plans' liability cash flows. The expected rates of return on plan asset assumptions represent the Company's assessment of long-term returns on diversified investment portfolios globally. The assessment is determined using projections from external financial sources, long-term historical averages, actual returns by asset class and the various asset class allocations by market.

International Plans are funded in accordance with local regulations. Additional discretionary contributions are made when deemed appropriate to meet the long-term obligations of the plans. For certain plans, funding is not a common practice, as funding provides no economic benefit. Consequently, the Company has several pension plans that are not funded. In 2022, the Company contributed $ 119 million and $ 151 million to its U.S. and international pension plans, respectively. The following table displays the funded status of the Company's U.S. Qualified & Non-Qualified pension plans and international funded and unfunded pension plans at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively: U.S. Plans International Plans Qualified Plans Non-Qualified Plans Funded Plans Unfunded Plans (Dollars in Millions) 2022 2021 2022 2021 2022 2021 2022 2021 Plan Assets $ 20,937 27,944 — — 10,577 13,986 — — Projected Benefit Obligation 18,394 25,041 1,937 2,703 9,024 13,428 276 410 Accumulated Benefit Obligation 17,696 23,985 1,872 2,479 8,202 12,212 253 373 Over (Under) Funded Status Projected Benefit Obligation $ 2,543 2,903 ( 1,937 ) ( 2,703 ) 1,553 558 ( 276 ) ( 410 ) Accumulated Benefit Obligation 3,241 3,959 ( 1,872 ) ( 2,479 ) 2,375 1,774 ( 253 ) ( 373 ) Plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets have an accumulated benefit obligation, projected benefit obligation and plan assets of $ 2.9 billion, $ 2.9 billion and $ 0.3 billion, respectively, at the end of 2022, and $ 3.9 billion, $ 4.2 billion and $ 0.3 billion, respectively, at the end of 2021.

In determining investment policies, strategies and goals, each committee or board considers factors including, local pension rules and regulations; local tax regulations; availability of investment vehicles (separate accounts, commingled accounts, insurance funds, etc.); funded status of the plans; ratio of actives to retirees; duration of liabilities; and other relevant factors including: diversification, liquidity of local markets and liquidity of base currency. A majority of the Company’s pension funds are open to new entrants and are expected to be on-going plans. Permitted investments are primarily liquid and/or listed, with little reliance on illiquid and non-traditional investments such as hedge funds. The Company’s retirement plan asset allocation at the end of 2022 and 2021 and target allocations for 2023 are as follows: Percent of Plan Assets Target Allocation 2022 2021 2023 Worldwide Retirement Plans Equity securities 62 % 65 % 61 % Debt securities 38 35 39 Total plan assets 100 % 100 % 100 % Determination of Fair Value of Plan Assets The Plan has an established and well-documented process for determining fair values. Fair value is based upon quoted market prices, where available. If listed prices or quotes are not available, fair value is based upon models that primarily use, as inputs, market-based or independently sourced market parameters, including yield curves, interest rates, volatilities, equity or debt prices, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. While the Plan believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. Valuation Hierarchy The authoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels within the hierarchy are described in the table below with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest. The Net Asset Value (NAV) is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, minus its liabilities, and then divided by the number of shares outstanding. A financial instrument’s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the investments measured at fair value. • Short-term investment funds — Cash and quoted short-term instruments are valued at the closing price or the amount held on deposit by the custodian bank. Other investments are through investment vehicles valued using the NAV provided by the administrator of the fund. The NAV is a quoted price in a market that is not active and classified as Level 2. • Government and agency securities — A limited number of these investments are valued at the closing price reported on the major market on which the individual securities are traded. Where quoted prices are available in an active market, the investments are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. If quoted market prices are not available for the specific security, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows. When quoted market prices for a security are not available in an active market, they are classified as Level 2. • Debt instruments — A limited number of these investments are valued at the closing price reported on the major market on which the individual securities are traded. Where quoted prices are available in an active market, the investments are classified as Level 1. If quoted market prices are not available for the specific security, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows and are classified as Level 2. Level 3 debt instruments are priced based on unobservable inputs. • Equity securities — Equity securities are valued at the closing price reported on the major market on which the individual securities are traded. Substantially all equity securities are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. • Commingled funds — These investment vehicles are valued using the NAV provided by the fund administrator. Assets in the Level 2 category have a quoted market price. 69 • Other assets — Other assets are represented primarily by limited partnerships. These investment vehicles are valued using the NAV provided by the fund administrator. Other assets that are exchange listed and actively traded are classified as Level 1, while inactively traded assets are classified as Level 2. The following table sets forth the Retirement Plans' investments measured at fair value as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021: Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets Significant Other Observable Inputs Significant Unobservable Inputs (1) Investments Measured at Net Asset Value (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Total Assets (Dollars in Millions) 2022 2021 2022 2021 2022 2021 2022 2021 2022 2021 Short-term investment funds $ 33 102 13 1,033 — — — — 46 1,135 Government and agency securities — — 5,863 7,016 — — — — 5,863 7,016 Debt instruments — — 3,681 3,505 — — — — 3,681 3,505 Equity securities 8,846 14,107 2 2 — — — — 8,848 14,109 Commingled funds — — 4,362 5,496 56 105 6,106 8,708 10,524 14,309 Other assets — — 33 34 13 15 2,506 1,807 2,552 1,856 Investments at fair value $ 8,879 14,209 13,954 17,086 69 120 8,612 10,515 31,514 41,930 (1) The activity for the Level 3 assets is not significant for all years presented. The Company's Other Benefit Plans are unfunded except for U.S. commingled funds (Level 2) of $ 78 million and $ 102 million at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The fair value of Johnson & Johnson Common Stock directly held in plan assets was $ 21 million ( 0.1 % of total plan assets) at December 31, 2022 and $ 385 million ( 0.9 % of total plan assets) at December 31, 2021. 11. Savings Plan The Company has voluntary 401(k) savings plans designed to enhance the existing retirement programs covering eligible employees. The Company matches a percentage of each employee’s contributions consistent with the provisions of the plan for which he/she is eligible. Total Company matching contributions to the plans were $ 275 million, $ 256 million and $ 243 million in fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 70 12. Capital and Treasury Stock Changes in treasury stock were: Treasury Stock (Amounts in Millions Except Treasury Stock Shares in Thousands) Shares Amount Balance at December 29, 2019 487,336 $ 38,417 Employee compensation and stock option plans ( 21,765 ) ( 3,148 ) Repurchase of common stock 21,760 3,221 Balance at January 3, 2021 487,331 38,490 Employee compensation and stock option plans ( 17,399 ) ( 2,847 ) Repurchase of common stock 20,946 3,456 Balance at January 2, 2022 490,878 39,099 Employee compensation and stock option plans ( 20,007 ) ( 3,440 ) Repurchase of common stock 35,375 6,035 Balance at January 1, 2023 506,246 $ 41,694 Aggregate shares of common stock issued were approximately 3,119,843,000 shares at the end of fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020. Cash dividends paid were $ 4.45 per share in fiscal year 2022, compared with dividends of $ 4.19 per share in fiscal year 2021, and $ 3.98 per share in fiscal year 2020. On January 3, 2023, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $ 1.13 per share, payable on March 7, 2023 to shareholders of record as of February 21, 2023. On September 14, 2022, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program, authorizing the Company to purchase up to $ 5.0 billion of the Company's shares of common stock. Share repurchases may be made at management’s discretion from time to time on the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. The repurchase program has no time limit and may be suspended for periods or discontinued at any time. Through January 1, 2023, approximately $ 2.5 billion has been repurchased under the program. 13. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) Components of other comprehensive income (loss) consist of the following: (Dollars in Millions) Foreign Currency Translation Gain/(Loss) On Securities Employee Benefit Plans Gain/ (Loss) On Derivatives & Hedges Total Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) December 29, 2019 $ ( 8,705 ) — ( 6,891 ) ( 295 ) ( 15,891 ) Net 2020 changes ( 233 ) 1 ( 66 ) 947 649 January 3, 2021 ( 8,938 ) 1 ( 6,957 ) 652 ( 15,242 ) Net 2021 changes ( 1,079 ) ( 4 ) 4,255 ( 988 ) 2,184 January 2, 2022 ( 10,017 ) ( 3 ) ( 2,702 ) ( 336 ) ( 13,058 ) Net 2022 changes ( 1,796 ) ( 24 ) 1,805 106 91 January 1, 2023 $ ( 11,813 ) ( 27 ) ( 897 ) ( 230 ) ( 12,967 ) Amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income are presented net of the related tax impact. Foreign currency translation is not adjusted for income taxes where it relates to permanent investments in international subsidiaries. For additional details on comprehensive income see the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Details on reclassifications out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income: Gain/(Loss) On Securities - reclassifications released to Other (income) expense, net. Employee Benefit Plans - reclassifications are included in net periodic benefit cost. See Note 10 for additional details. Gain/(Loss) On Derivatives & Hedges - reclassifications to earnings are recorded in the same account as the hedged transaction. See Note 6 for additional details. 71 14. International Currency Translation For translation of its subsidiaries operating in non-U.S. Dollar currencies, the Company has determined that the local currencies of its international subsidiaries are the functional currencies except those in highly inflationary economies, which are defined as those which have had compound cumulative rates of inflation of 100% or more during the past three years, or where a substantial portion of its cash flows are not in the local currency. For the majority of the Company's subsidiaries the local currency is the functional currency. In consolidating international subsidiaries, balance sheet currency effects are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. The other current and non-current assets line within the Statement of Cash flows includes the impact of foreign currency translation. This equity account includes the results of translating certain balance sheet assets and liabilities at current exchange rates and some accounts at historical rates, except for those located in highly inflationary economies, (Argentina and Venezuela). Beginning in the fiscal second quarter of 2022, the Company also accounted for operations in Turkey as highly inflationary. The translation of balance sheet accounts for highly inflationary economies are reflected in the operating results. A rollforward of the changes during fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020 for foreign currency translation adjustments is included in Note 13. Net currency transaction gains and losses included in Other (income) expense were losses of $ 328 million, $ 236 million and $ 209 million in fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 15. Earnings Per Share The following is a reconciliation of basic net earnings per share to diluted net earnings per share for the fiscal years ended January 1, 2023, January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021: (In Millions Except Per Share Amounts) 2022 2021 2020 Basic net earnings per share $ 6.83 7.93 5.59 Average shares outstanding — basic 2,625.2 2,632.1 2,632.8 Potential shares exercisable under stock option plans 140.1 138.0 118.3 Less: shares repurchased under treasury stock method ( 101.4 ) ( 96.1 ) ( 80.4 ) Adjusted average shares outstanding — diluted 2,663.9 2,674.0 2,670.7 Diluted net earnings per share $ 6.73 7.81 5.51 The diluted net earnings per share calculation for the fiscal years 2022 and 2021 included all shares related to stock options, as the exercise price of these options was less than the average market value of the Company's stock. The diluted net earnings per share calculation for fiscal year 2020 excluded 18 million shares related to stock options, as the exercise price of these options was greater than the average market value of the Company's stock. 16. Common Stock, Stock Option Plans and Stock Compensation Agreements At January 1, 2023, the Company had one stock-based compensation plan. The shares outstanding are for contracts under the Company's 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan and the 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan. The 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan expired on April 26, 2022. All awards (stock options, restricted shares units and performance share units) granted subsequent to that date were under the 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan. Under the 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan, the Company may issue up to 150 million shares of common stock, of which up to 110 million shares of common stock may be issued subject to stock options or stock appreciation rights and up to 40 million shares of common stock may be issued subject to full value awards. Awards will generally be counted on a 1-for-1 basis against the share reserve, provided that if more than 40 million full value awards are granted, each full value award in excess of 40 million will be counted on a 5-for-1 basis against the share reserve. Shares available for future grants under the 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan were 150 million at the end of fiscal year 2022. The compensation cost that has been charged against income for these plans was $ 1,138 million, $ 1,135 million and $ 1,005 million for fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The total income tax benefit recognized in the income statement for share-based compensation costs was $ 196 million, $ 218 million and $ 210 million for fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Company also recognized additional income tax benefits of $ 282 million, $ 223 million and $ 248 million for fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, for which options were exercised or restricted shares were vested. The total unrecognized compensation cost was $ 939 million, $ 862 million and $ 804 million for fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The weighted average period for this cost to be recognized was 1.80 years, 1.78 years and 1.76 years for fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Share-based compensation costs capitalized as part of inventory were insignificant in all periods. The Company settles employee benefit equity issuances with treasury shares. Treasury shares are replenished through market purchases throughout the year for the number of shares used to settle employee benefit equity issuances. 72 Stock Options Stock options expire 10 years from the date of grant and vest over service periods that range from 6 months to 4 years. All options are granted at the average of the high and low prices of the Company’s Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of grant. The fair value of each option award was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model that uses the assumptions noted in the following table. For 2022, 2021, and 2020 grants, expected volatility represents a blended rate of 10-year weekly historical overall volatility rate, and a 5-week average implied volatility rate based on at-the-money traded Johnson & Johnson options with a life of 2 years. For all grants, historical data is used to determine the expected life of the option. The risk-free rate was based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The average fair value of options granted was $ 23.23 , $ 20.86 and $ 16.42 , in fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Restricted Share Units and Performance Share Units The Company grants restricted share units which vest over service periods that range from 6 months to 3 years. The Company also grants performance share units, which are paid in shares of Johnson & Johnson Common Stock after the end of a three-year performance period. Performance shares were granted with two equally-weighted goals that directly align with or help drive long-term total shareholder return: adjusted operational earnings per share and relative total shareholder return. The number of shares actually earned at the end of the three-year period will vary, based only on actual performance, from 0 % to 200 % of the target number of performance share units granted . A summary of the restricted share units and performance share units activity under the Plans as of January 1, 2023 is presented below: (Shares in Thousands) Outstanding Restricted Share Units Outstanding Performance Share Units Shares at January 2, 2022 14,122 2,312 Granted 5,154 753 Issued ( 4,866 ) ( 637 ) Canceled/forfeited/adjusted ( 794 ) ( 71 ) Shares at January 1, 2023 13,616 2,357 The average fair value of the restricted share units granted was $ 153.67 , $ 152.62 and $ 139.58 in fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, using the fair market value at the date of grant. The fair value of restricted share units was discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the restricted share units during the vesting period. The fair value of restricted share units issued was $ 591 million, $ 611 million and $ 650 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The weighted average fair value of the performance share units granted was $ 170.46 , $ 179.35 and $ 160.54 in fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, calculated using the weighted average fair market value for each of the component goals at the date of grant. The fair values for the sales and earnings per share goals of each performance share unit were estimated on the date of grant using the fair market value of the shares at the time of the award discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the performance share units during the vesting period. The fair value for the relative total shareholder return goal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo valuation model. The fair value of performance share units issued was $ 94 million, $ 83 million and $ 91 million in fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 74 17.

Acquisitions and Divestitures During the fiscal year 2022, certain businesses were acquired for $ 17.7 billion in cash and $ 1.1 billion of liabilities assumed. These acquisitions were accounted for using the acquisition method and, accordingly, results of operations have been included in the financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition. The excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired amounted to $ 17.3 billion and has been assigned to identifiable intangible assets, with any residual recorded to goodwill. The fiscal year 2022 acquisitions primarily included Abiomed, Inc. (Abiomed). The remaining acquisitions were not material. On December 22, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of Abiomed, a leading, first-to-market provider of cardiovascular medical technology with a first-in-kind portfolio for the treatment of coronary artery disease and heart failure which also has an extensive innovation pipeline of life-saving technologies. The transaction broadens the Company’s position as a growing cardiovascular innovator, advancing the standard of care in heart failure and recovery, one of healthcare’s largest areas of unmet need. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination and the results of operations were included in the MedTech segment as of the date of the acquisition. The acquisition was completed through a tender offer for all outstanding shares. The consideration paid in the acquisition consisted of an upfront payment of $ 380.00 per share in cash, amounting to $ 17.1 billion, net of cash acquired, as well as a non-tradeable contingent value right (“CVR”) entitling the holder to receive up to $ 35.00 per share in cash (which with respect to the CVRs total approximately $ 1.6 billion in the aggregate) if certain commercial and clinical milestones are achieved. The corresponding enterprise value (without taking into account the CVRs) of approximately $ 16.5 billion includes cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities acquired. The milestones of the CVR consist of: a. $ 17.50 per share, payable if net sales for Abiomed products exceeds $ 3.7 billion during Johnson & Johnson’s fiscal second quarter of 2027 through fiscal first quarter of 2028, or if this threshold is not met during this period and is subsequently met during any rolling four quarter period up to the end of Johnson & Johnson’s fiscal first quarter of 2029, $ 8.75 per share; b. $ 7.50 per share payable upon FDA premarket application approval of the use of Impella ® products in ST-elevated myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients without cardiogenic shock by January 1, 2028; and c. $ 10.00 per share payable upon the first publication of a Class I recommendation for the use of Impella ® products in high risk PCI or STEMI with or without cardiogenic shock within four years from their respective clinical endpoint publication dates, but in all cases no later than December 31, 2029. The fair value of the acquisition was allocated to assets acquired of $ 19.9 billion (net of $ 0.3 billion cash acquired), primarily to goodwill for $ 10.9 billion, amortizable intangible assets for $ 6.6 billion, IPR&D for $ 1.1 billion, marketable 82 securities of $ 0.6 billion and liabilities assumed of $ 2.8 billion, which includes the fair value of the contingent consideration mentioned above for $ 0.7 billion and deferred taxes of $ 1.8 billion. The goodwill is primarily attributable to the commercial acceleration and expansion of the portfolio and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The contingent consideration was recorded in Other Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. As the acquisition occurred in December 2022, the Company is still finalizing the allocation of the purchase price to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The allocation of the purchase price included in the current period balance sheet is based on the best estimate of management and is preliminary and subject to change. To assist management in the allocation, the Company engaged valuation specialists to prepare appraisals. The Company will finalize the amounts recognized as the information necessary to complete the analysis is obtained. The Company expects to finalize these amounts as soon as possible but no later than one year from the acquisition date. The amortizable intangible assets were primarily comprised of already in-market products of the Impella ® platform with an average weighted life of 14 years. The IPR&D assets were valued for technology programs for unapproved products. The value of the IPR&D was calculated using probability-adjusted cash flow projections discounted for the risk inherent in such projects. The probability of success factor ranged from 52 % to 70 %. The discount rate applied was 9.5 %. In 2022, the Company recorded acquisition related costs before tax of approximately $ 0.3 billion, which was recorded in Other (income)/expense. During fiscal year 2021, the Company did not make any material acquisitions. During fiscal year 2020, certain businesses were acquired for $ 7.3 billion in cash and $ 0.4 billion of liabilities assumed. These acquisitions were accounted for using the acquisition method and, accordingly, results of operations have been included in the financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition. The excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired amounted to $ 7.5 billion and has been assigned to identifiable intangible assets, with any residual recorded to goodwill. The fiscal year 2020 acquisitions primarily included: all rights to the investigational compound bermekimab, which has multiple dermatological indications, along with certain employees from XBiotech Inc. (XBiotech), Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Momenta), a company that discovers and develops novel therapies for immune-mediated diseases and the outstanding shares in Verb Surgical Inc., a company with significant robotics and data science capabilities. During the fiscal first quarter of 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of all rights to the investigational compound bermekimab, which has multiple dermatological indications, along with certain employees from XBiotech Inc., for a purchase price of $ 0.8 billion. The fair value of the acquisition was allocated primarily to non-amortizable intangible assets, primarily IPR&D, for $ 0.8 billion applying a probability of success factor that ranged from 20 % to 60 % to reflect inherent development, regulatory and commercial risk for the different indications. The discount rate applied was approximately 16 %. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination and included in the Pharmaceutical segment. In fiscal 2022, the Company recorded an intangible asset impairment charge of approximately $ 0.8 billion related to this in-process research and development asset. Additionally, in the fiscal first quarter of 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of all outstanding shares in Verb Surgical Inc., a company with significant robotics and data science capabilities, including those shares previously held by Verily. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination and included in the MedTech segment. The fair value of the acquisition was allocated primarily to non-amortizable intangible assets, primarily IPR&D, for $ 0.4 billion, goodwill for $ 0.2 billion, other assets of $ 0.2 billion and liabilities assumed of $ 0.3 billion. The fair value of the Company's previously held equity investment in Verb Surgical Inc. was $ 0.4 billion. On October 1, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of Momenta for a purchase price of approximately $ 6.1 billion, net of cash acquired. The fair value of the acquisition was allocated primarily to non-amortizable intangible assets (IPR&D) of $ 6.0 billion, goodwill of $ 1.2 billion, other assets of $ 0.5 billion and liabilities of $ 1.6 billion. The assets acquired are intended to address substantial unmet medical need in maternal-fetal disorders, neuro-inflammatory disorders, rheumatology, dermatology and autoimmune hematology. Depending on the asset, probability of success factors ranging from 20 % to 77 % were used in the fair value calculation to reflect inherent development and regulatory risk of the IPR&D. The discount rate applied was approximately 13 %. The goodwill is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise from the business acquisition and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination and included in the Pharmaceutical segment. In accordance with U.S. GAAP standards related to business combinations, and goodwill and other intangible assets, supplemental pro forma information for fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020 is not provided, as the impact of the aforementioned acquisitions did not have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations. Divestitures During fiscal year 2022, the Company did not make any material divestitures. During fiscal year 2021, in separate transactions, the Company divested two brands outside the U.S. within the Pharmaceutical segment. The Company recognized a pre-tax gain recorded in Other (income) expense, net, of approximately $ 0.6 billion. 83 During fiscal year 2020, the Company sold 11.8 million shares of Idorsia LTD (Idorsia), or its 8.3 % ownership in the company at that time. The transaction resulted in gross proceeds of approximately CHF 337 million ($ 357 million) based on a sales price of CHF 28.55 /share and resulted in an immaterial net loss. At the end of fiscal 2020, the Company had rights to approximately 38.7 million shares through a convertible loan with a principal amount of CHF 445 million (due June 2027). During fiscal year 2021, the Company converted CHF 110 million ($ 120 million) of this loan into approximately 9.6 million shares of Idorsia which were reflected at fair value as of January 2, 2022. During the fiscal third quarter of 2021, the Company's undrawn credit facility with Idorsia was terminated. 19. Legal Proceedings Johnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product liability; intellectual property; commercial; indemnification and other matters; governmental investigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of their business. The Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a liability will be incurred, and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of January 1, 2023, the Company has determined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal issue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance with ASC 450-20-25. For these and other litigation and regulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors including, among other things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and unpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements; complexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. To the extent adverse awards, judgments or verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated. In the Company’s opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with counsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company’s balance sheet, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position. However, the resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and cash flows for that period. PRODUCT LIABILITY The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in numerous product liability claims and lawsuits involving multiple products. Claimants in these cases seek substantial compensatory and, where available, punitive damages. While the Company believes it has substantial defenses, it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation. From time to time, even if it has substantial defenses, the Company considers isolated settlements based on a variety of circumstances. The Company has established accruals for product liability claims and lawsuits in compliance with ASC 450-20 based on currently available information, which in some cases may be limited. The Company accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to defend each matter when those costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. For certain of these matters, the Company has accrued additional amounts such as estimated costs associated with settlements, damages and other losses. Product liability accruals can represent projected product liability for thousands of claims around the world, each in different litigation environments and with different fact patterns. Changes to the accruals may be required in the future as additional information becomes available. The most significant of these cases include: the DePuy ASR XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR Hip Resurfacing System; the PINNACLE Acetabular Cup System; pelvic meshes; RISPERDAL; body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON'S Baby Powder; ETHICON PHYSIOMESH Flexible Composite Mesh; ELMIRON; and TYLENOL. As of January 1, 2023, in the United States there were approximately 170 plaintiffs with direct claims in pending lawsuits regarding injuries allegedly due to the DePuy ASR XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR Hip Resurfacing System; 1,400 with respect to the PINNACLE Acetabular Cup System; 9,000 with respect to pelvic meshes; 1,100 with respect to RISPERDAL; 40,300 with respect to body powders containing talc; 2,100 with respect to ETHICON PHYSIOMESH Flexible Composite Mesh; 2,000 with respect to ELMIRON; and 170 with respect to TYLENOL. The number of pending lawsuits is expected to fluctuate as certain lawsuits are settled or dismissed and additional lawsuits are filed. 84 In August 2010, DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. (DePuy) announced a worldwide voluntary recall of its ASR XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR Hip Resurfacing System (ASR Hip) used in hip replacement surgery. Claims for personal injury have been made against DePuy and the Company. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. Litigation has also been filed in countries outside of the United States, primarily in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Ireland, Germany, India and Italy. In November 2013, DePuy reached an agreement with a Court-appointed committee of lawyers representing ASR Hip plaintiffs to establish a program to settle claims with eligible ASR Hip patients in the United States who had surgery to replace their ASR Hips, known as revision surgery, as of August 2013. DePuy reached additional agreements in February 2015 and March 2017, which further extended the settlement program to include ASR Hip patients who had revision surgeries after August 2013 and prior to February 15, 2017. This settlement program has resolved more than 10,000 claims, thereby bringing to resolution significant ASR Hip litigation activity in the United States. However, lawsuits in the United States remain, and the settlement program does not address litigation outside of the United States. In Australia, a class action settlement was reached that resolved the claims of the majority of ASR Hip patients in that country. In Canada, the Company has reached agreements to settle the class actions filed in that country. The Company continues to receive information with respect to potential additional costs associated with this recall on a worldwide basis. The Company has established accruals for the costs associated with the United States settlement program and ASR Hip-related product liability litigation. Claims for personal injury have also been made against DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. and the Company (collectively, DePuy) relating to the PINNACLE Acetabular Cup System used in hip replacement surgery. Product liability lawsuits continue to be filed, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. Most cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas (Texas MDL). Beginning on June 1, 2022, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation ceased transfer of new cases into the Texas MDL, and there are now cases pending in federal court outside the Texas MDL. Litigation also has been filed in state courts and in countries outside of the United States. Prior to 2019, several adverse verdicts had been rendered against DePuy, one of which was reversed on appeal and remanded for retrial. During the first quarter of 2019, DePuy established a United States settlement program to resolve these cases. As part of the settlement program, adverse verdicts have been settled. The Company has established an accrual for product liability litigation associated with the PINNACLE Acetabular Cup System and the related settlement program. Claims for personal injury have been made against Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon) and the Company arising out of Ethicon’s pelvic mesh devices used to treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. The Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and additional cases. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States had been organized as a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia. In March 2021, the MDL Court entered an order closing the MDL. The MDL Court has remanded cases for trial to the jurisdictions where the case was originally filed and additional pelvic mesh lawsuits have been filed, and remain, outside of the MDL. The Company has settled or otherwise resolved the majority of the United States cases and the estimated costs associated with these settlements and the remaining cases are reflected in the Company’s accruals. In addition, class actions and individual personal injury cases or claims seeking damages for alleged injury resulting from Ethicon’s pelvic mesh devices have been commenced in various countries outside of the United States, including claims and cases in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Ireland, Italy, Spain and Slovenia and class actions in Israel, Australia, Canada and South Africa. In November 2019, the Federal Court of Australia issued a judgment regarding its findings with respect to liability in relation to the three Lead Applicants and generally in relation to the design, manufacture, pre and post-market assessments and testing, and supply and promotion of the devices in Australia used to treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. In September 2022, after exhausting its appeals, the Company reached an in-principle agreement to resolve the two pelvic mesh class actions in Australia, pending Federal Court approval. In November 2022, the application for approval of the settlement was filed, and a hearing on the settlement has been scheduled for the end of February 2023. The class actions in Canada were discontinued in 2020 as a result of a settlement of a group of cases and an agreement to resolve the Israeli class action was reached in May 2021. The parties in the Israeli class action are currently finalizing the terms of the settlement. A motion to approve the settlement was filed with the Court. The Company has established accruals with respect to product liability litigation associated with Ethicon’s pelvic mesh products. Following a June 2016 worldwide market withdrawal of ETHICON PHYSIOMESH Flexible Composite Mesh (Physiomesh), claims for personal injury have been made against Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon) and the Company alleging personal injury arising out of the use of this hernia mesh device. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. A multi-county litigation (MCL) also has been formed in New Jersey state court and assigned to Atlantic County for cases pending in New Jersey. In addition to the matters in the MDL and MCL, there are additional lawsuits pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District 85 of Ohio, which are part of the MDL for polypropylene mesh devices manufactured by C.R. Bard, Inc., and lawsuits pending in two New Jersey MCLs formed for Proceed/Proceed Ventral Patch and Prolene Hernia systems, and lawsuits pending outside the United States. In May 2021, Ethicon and lead counsel for the plaintiffs entered into a term sheet to resolve approximately 3,600 Physiomesh cases (covering approximately 4,300 plaintiffs) pending in the MDL and MCL at that time. A master settlement agreement (MSA) was entered into in September 2021 and includes 3,729 cases in the MDL and MCL. All deadlines and trial settings in those proceedings are currently stayed pending the completion of the settlement agreement. Of the cases subject to the MSA, 2,236 have been dismissed with prejudice. Post-settlement cases in the Physiomesh MDL and MCL are subject to docket control orders requiring early expert reports and discovery requirements. As of January 2023, there are approximately 208 active cases subject to these orders which are being reviewed and evaluated. Claims have also been filed against Ethicon and the Company alleging personal injuries arising from the PROCEED Mesh and PROCEED Ventral Patch hernia mesh products. In March 2019, the New Jersey Supreme Court entered an order consolidating these cases pending in New Jersey as an MCL in Atlantic County Superior Court. Additional cases have been filed in various federal and state courts in the United States, and in jurisdictions outside the United States. Ethicon and the Company also have been subject to claims for personal injuries arising from the PROLENE Polypropylene Hernia System. In January 2020, the New Jersey Supreme Court created an MCL in Atlantic County Superior Court to handle such cases. Cases involving this product have also been filed in other federal and state courts in the United States. In October 2022, an agreement in principle, subject to various conditions, was reached to settle the majority of the pending cases involving Proceed, Proceed Ventral Patch, Prolene Hernia System and related multi-layered mesh products. All litigation activities in the two New Jersey MCLs are stayed pending resolution of the proposed settlement. Future cases that are filed in the New Jersey MCLs will be subject to docket control orders requiring early expert reports and discovery requirements. The Company has established accruals with respect to product liability litigation associated with ETHICON PHYSIOMESH Flexible Composite Mesh, PROCEED Mesh and PROCEED Ventral Patch, and PROLENE Polypropylene Hernia System products. Claims for personal injury have been made against Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and the Company arising out of the use of RISPERDAL, and related compounds, indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia, acute manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder and irritability associated with autism. Lawsuits primarily have been filed in state courts in Pennsylvania, California, and Missouri. Other actions are pending in various courts in the United States and Canada. Product liability lawsuits continue to be filed, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. The Company has successfully defended a number of these cases but there have been verdicts against the Company, including a verdict in October 2019 of $ 8.0 billion of punitive damages related to one plaintiff, which the trial judge reduced to $ 6.8 million in January 2020. In September 2021, the Company entered into a settlement in principle with the counsel representing plaintiffs in this matter and in substantially all of the outstanding cases in the United States. The costs associated with this and other settlements are reflected in the Company’s accruals. Claims for personal injury arising out of the use of XARELTO, an oral anticoagulant, have been made against Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI); the Company; and JPI’s collaboration partner for XARELTO, Bayer Healthcare AG, and certain of its affiliates. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. In addition, cases were filed in state courts across the United States. Many of these cases were consolidated into a state mass tort litigation in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and in a coordinated proceeding in Los Angeles, California. Class action lawsuits also have been filed in Canada. In March 2019, JPI and the Company announced an agreement in principle to settle the XARELTO cases in the United States; the settlement agreement was executed in May 2019, the settlement became final in December 2019, and the settlement was funded in January 2020. This resolved the majority of cases pending in the United States. The Company has established accruals for its costs associated with the United States settlement program and XARELTO related product liability litigation. A significant number of personal injury claims alleging that talc causes cancer were made against Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. and the Company arising out of the use of body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S Baby Powder. The number of these personal injury lawsuits, filed in state and federal courts in the United States as well as outside of the United States, continued to increase. In talc cases that previously have gone to trial, the Company has obtained a number of defense verdicts, but there also have been verdicts against the Company, many of which have been reversed on appeal. In June 2020, the Missouri Court of Appeals reversed in part and affirmed in part a July 2018 verdict of $ 4.7 billion in Ingham v. Johnson & Johnson, et al., No. ED 207476 (Mo. App.), reducing the overall award to $ 2.1 billion. An application for transfer of the case to the Missouri Supreme Court 86 was subsequently denied and in June 2021, a petition for certiorari, seeking a review of the Ingham decision by the United States Supreme Court, was denied. In June 2021, the Company paid the award, which, including interest, totaled approximately $ 2.5 billion. The facts and circumstances, including the terms of the award, were unique to the Ingham decision and not representative of other claims brought against the Company. The Company continues to believe that it has strong legal grounds to contest the other talc verdicts that it has appealed. Notwithstanding the Company’s confidence in the safety of its talc products, in certain circumstances the Company has settled cases. In October 2021, Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. (Old JJCI) implemented a corporate restructuring (the 2021 Corporate Restructuring). As a result of that restructuring, Old JJCI ceased to exist and three new entities were created: (a) LTL Management LLC, a North Carolina limited liability company (LTL or Debtor); (b) Royalty A&M LLC, a North Carolina limited liability company and a direct subsidiary of LTL (RAM); and (c) the Debtor’s direct parent, Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc., a New Jersey company (New JJCI). The Debtor received certain of Old JJCI’s assets and became solely responsible for the talc-related liabilities of Old JJCI, including all liabilities related in any way to injury or damage, or alleged injury or damage, sustained or incurred in the purchase or use of, or exposure to, talc, including talc contained in any product, or to the risk of, or responsibility for, any such damage or injury, except for any liabilities for which the exclusive remedy is provided under a workers’ compensation statute or act (the Talc-Related Liabilities). In October 2021, notwithstanding the Company’s confidence in the safety of its talc products, the Debtor filed a voluntary petition with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of North Carolina, Charlotte Division, seeking relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the LTL Bankruptcy Case). As a result of the LTL Bankruptcy Case, the North Carolina Bankruptcy Court entered a temporary restraining order staying all litigation against LTL and Old JJCI. On November 15, 2021, the North Carolina Bankruptcy Court confirmed the scope of the stay, issuing a Preliminary Injunction (PI) prohibiting and enjoining the commencement and prosecution of talc-related claims against LTL, Old JJCI, New JJCI, the Company, other of their corporate affiliates, identified retailers, insurance companies, and certain other parties (the Protected Parties). The LTL Bankruptcy Case was transferred to the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey in November 2021, and that court extended the PI through the end of February 2022. Claimants filed motions to dismiss the LTL Bankruptcy Case and, following a multiple day hearing, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court denied those motions by order issued in March 2022. The New Jersey Bankruptcy Court simultaneously issued another order extending the stay as to the Protected Parties. The claimants subsequently filed notices of appeal as to the denial of the motions to dismiss and the extension of the stay. In May 2022, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals granted the petitions to appeal. The briefing and oral argument on the appeal were completed in September 2022. On January 30, 2023, the Third Circuit reversed the Bankruptcy Court’s ruling and remanded to the Bankruptcy Court to dismiss the LTL bankruptcy. LTL filed a petition for rehearing on the decision. While the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court’s order effectively stays all of the Company’s talc-related personal injury litigation, LTL has agreed to lift the stay on a small number of appeals where appeal bonds have been filed. The Company has agreed to provide funding to LTL for the payment of amounts the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court determines are owed by LTL and the establishment of a $ 2 billion trust in furtherance of this purpose. The Company has established a reserve for approximately $ 2 billion in connection with the aforementioned trust. After and as a result of the filing of the LTL Bankruptcy Case, the Company de-consolidated LTL, which is a related party. The impact of the de-consolidation is not material to the Company. The parties have not yet reached a resolution of all talc matters in the LTL Bankruptcy Case, and the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amount accrued. A class action advancing claims relating to industrial talc was filed against the Company and others in New Jersey state court in May 2022 (the Edley Class Action). The Edley Class Action asserts, among other things, that the Company fraudulently defended past asbestos personal injury lawsuits arising from exposure to industrial talc mined, milled, and manufactured before January 6, 1989 by the Company’s then wholly owned subsidiary, Windsor Minerals, Inc., which is currently a debtor in the Imerys Bankruptcy described hereafter. The Company removed the Edley Class Action to federal court in the District of New Jersey. In July 2022, Imerys filed a motion in the Imerys Bankruptcy to stay the Edley Class Action, which was denied in August 2022. In October 2022, the Company filed motions to dismiss and to deny certification of a class to pursue the Edley Class Action in the New Jersey District Court. In February 2019, the Company’s talc supplier, Imerys Talc America, Inc. and two of its affiliates, Imerys Talc Vermont, Inc. and Imerys Talc Canada, Inc. (collectively, Imerys) filed a voluntary petition under chapter 11 of the United States Code (the Bankruptcy Code) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (Imerys Bankruptcy). The Imerys Bankruptcy relates to Imerys’s potential liability for personal injury from exposure to talcum powder sold by Imerys. In its bankruptcy, Imerys alleges it has claims against the Company for indemnification and rights to joint insurance proceeds. In May 2020, Imerys, its parent Imerys S.A., the Tort Claimants’ Committee (TCC), and the Future Claimants’ Representative (FCR) (collectively, the Plan Proponents) filed their Plan of Reorganization (the Plan) and the Disclosure Statement related 87 thereto. The Plan Proponents have since filed numerous amendments to the Plan and Disclosure Statement. A hearing on the Plan Proponent’s Disclosure Statement was held in January 2021, and the Court entered an order approving the Disclosure Statement, allowing Imerys to proceed with soliciting votes on the Plan. In March 2021, the Company voted to reject the Plan and opted out of the consensual releases in the Plan. In April 2021, the Plan Proponents announced the Plan had received the requisite number of accepting votes to confirm the Plan. The Company challenged certain improprieties with respect to portions of the vote and sought to disqualify those votes. In October 2021, the Bankruptcy Court issued a ruling deeming thousands of votes as withdrawn. In October 2021, Imerys cancelled the confirmation hearing on the Plan. Imerys, the TCC, the FCR, certain of Imerys’s insurers, and certain parties in the Cyprus Mines chapter 11 case (described below) (collectively the Mediation Parties) agreed to engage in mediation. The most recent term of the mediation ended on December 31, 2022. In July 2021, Imerys commenced an adversary proceeding against the Company in the Imerys Bankruptcy (the Imerys Adversary Proceeding). The Imerys Adversary Proceeding sought, among other things, certain declarations with respect to the indemnification obligations allegedly owed by the Company to Imerys. The TCC and FCR simultaneously filed a motion for temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin the Company from undergoing a corporate restructuring that would separate the Company’s talc liabilities from its other assets. The Bankruptcy Court denied the motion. The Company thereafter filed a motion to dismiss the adversary proceeding. The Bankruptcy Court has not yet decided the motion to dismiss. In October 2021, the Company filed a Notice of Bankruptcy Filing and Stay of Proceedings clarifying that the automatic stay arising upon the filing of the LTL Bankruptcy Case should apply to the Imerys Adversary Proceeding. In June 2020, Cyprus Mines Corporation and its parent, Cyprus Amax Minerals Company (CAMC) (together, Cyprus), which had owned certain Imerys talc mines, filed an adversary proceeding against the Company and Imerys in the Imerys Bankruptcy seeking a declaration of indemnity rights under certain contractual agreements (the Cyprus Adversary Proceeding). The Company denies such indemnification is owed, and filed a motion to dismiss the adversary complaint. In February 2021, Cyprus filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code and filed its Disclosure Statement and Plan (the Cyprus Plan). The Cyprus Plan contemplates a settlement with Imerys and talc claimants where Cyprus would make a monetary contribution to a trust established under the Imerys Plan in exchange for an injunction against talc claims asserted against it and certain protected parties. Cyprus has not yet sought approval of its Disclosure Statement and Plan. Cyprus, along with the TCC and FCR appointed in the Cyprus chapter 11 case, have agreed to participate in the mediation with the Mediation Parties. In October 2021, the Company filed a Notice of Bankruptcy Filing and Stay of Proceedings clarifying that the automatic stay arising upon the filing of the LTL Bankruptcy Case should apply to the Cyprus Adversary Proceeding. In June 2022, Cyprus commenced an Adversary Proceeding in its chapter 11 case seeking an order enforcing the automatic stay by enjoining parties from commencing or continuing “talc-related claims” against CAMC. In June 2022, the court entered a preliminary injunction order enjoining claimants from pursuing talc-related claims against CAMC through January 2023. In February 2021, several of the Company’s insurers involved in coverage litigation in New Jersey State Court (the Coverage Action) filed a motion in the Imerys Bankruptcy Court proceeding seeking a determination that the automatic stay does not apply to the Coverage Action and, in the alternative, seeking relief from the automatic stay to allow them to continue to litigate their claims in the Coverage Action. In March 2021, the Company filed a limited response and reservation of rights with respect to the motion. The Court entered an agreed order modifying the stay to allow the litigation in the Coverage Action to continue. In October 2021, LTL filed a Notice of Bankruptcy Filing and Stay of Proceedings clarifying that the automatic stay arising upon the filing of the LTL Bankruptcy Case should apply to the Coverage Action. In March 2022, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court ruled that the LTL automatic stay applied to the Coverage Action. In February 2018, a securities class action lawsuit was filed against the Company and certain named officers in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging that the Company violated the federal securities laws by failing to disclose alleged asbestos contamination in body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S Baby Powder, and that purchasers of the Company’s shares suffered losses as a result. Plaintiff is seeking damages. In April 2019, the Company moved to dismiss the complaint and briefing on the motion was complete as of August 2019. In December 2019, the Court denied, in part, the motion to dismiss. In March 2020, the Company answered the complaint. In April 2021, briefing on Plaintiff’s motion for class certification was completed. In July 2021, the Company filed a notice of supplemental authority in opposition to Plaintiff’s motion for class certification, and Plaintiff filed a response. In December 2021, the Company filed a motion to supplement the class certification record, and in January 2022, Plaintiff responded. In March 2022, LTL asked the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court to stay the securities class action. In April 2022, Defendants filed a second motion to supplement the class certification record. In May 2022, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court entered an order staying the securities class action. Plaintiff has appealed the Bankruptcy Court’s order. 88 A lawsuit was brought against the Company in the Superior Court of California for the County of San Diego alleging violations of California’s Consumer Legal Remedies Act (CLRA) relating to JOHNSON’S Baby Powder. In that lawsuit, the plaintiffs allege that the Company violated the CLRA by failing to provide required Proposition 65 warnings. In July 2019, the Company filed a notice of removal to the United States District Court for the Southern District of California and plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint shortly thereafter. In October 2019, the Company moved to dismiss the second amended complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. In response to those motions, plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint. In December 2019, the Company moved to dismiss the third amended complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. In April 2020, the Court granted the motion to dismiss but granted leave to amend. In May 2020, plaintiffs filed a Fourth Amended Complaint but indicated that they would be filing a motion for leave to file a fifth amended complaint. Plaintiffs filed a Fifth Amended Complaint in August 2020. The Company moved to dismiss the Fifth Amended Complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. In January 2021, the Court issued an Order and opinion ruling in the Company’s favor and granting the motion to dismiss with prejudice. In February 2021, Plaintiffs filed a Notice of Appeal with the Ninth Circuit. Plaintiffs filed their opening brief in July 2021. The company filed its responsive brief in October 2021. In October 2021, Notice of Suggestion of Bankruptcy was filed with the Ninth Circuit. A bankruptcy stay was imposed in December 2021, and the Court held the reply deadline in abeyance. In February 2022, the Bankruptcy Court issued an order extending the stay. The appeal continues to be held in abeyance, with the Company being required to file periodic status updates. In addition, the Company has received inquiries, subpoenas, and requests to produce documents regarding talc matters and the LTL Bankruptcy Case from various governmental authorities. The Company has produced documents and responded to inquiries, and will continue to cooperate with government inquiries. Claims for personal injury have been made against a number of Johnson & Johnson companies, including Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and the Company, arising out of the use of INVOKANA, a prescription medication indicated to improve glycemic control in adults with Type 2 diabetes. In December 2016, lawsuits filed in federal courts in the United States were organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. Cases have also been filed in state courts. Class action lawsuits have been filed in Canada. Product liability lawsuits continue to be filed, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. The Company has settled or otherwise resolved many of the cases and claims in the United States and the costs associated with these settlements are reflected in the Company’s accruals. Claims for personal injury have been made against a number of Johnson & Johnson companies, including Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and the Company, arising out of the use of ELMIRON, a prescription medication indicated for the relief of bladder pain or discomfort associated with interstitial cystitis. These lawsuits, which allege that ELMIRON contributes to the development of permanent retinal injury and vision loss, have been filed in both state and federal courts across the United States. In December 2020, lawsuits filed in federal courts in the United States, including putative class action cases seeking medical monitoring, were organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. In addition, cases have been filed in various state courts of New Jersey, which have been coordinated in a multi-county litigation in Bergen County, as well as the Court of Common Pleas in Philadelphia, which have been coordinated and granted mass tort designation. In addition, three class action lawsuits have been filed in Canada. Product liability lawsuits continue to be filed, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. The Company has established accruals for defense and indemnity costs associated with ELMIRON related product liability litigation. Claims for personal injury have been made against Johnson and Johnson Consumer Inc. (JJCI), arising out of the use of TYLENOL, an over-the-counter pain medication, alleging that prenatal exposure to acetaminophen is associated with the development of autism spectrum disorder and/or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. In October 2022, lawsuits filed in federal courts in the United States were organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. In addition, lawsuits have been filed in Canada. Product liability lawsuits continue to be filed, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. The Company has established accruals for defense costs associated with TYLENOL related product liability litigation. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY Certain subsidiaries of the Company are subject, from time to time, to legal proceedings and claims related to patent, trademark and other intellectual property matters arising out of their businesses. Many of these matters involve challenges to the coverage and/or validity of the patents on various products and allegations that certain of the Company’s products infringe the patents of third parties. Although these subsidiaries believe that they have substantial defenses to these challenges and allegations with respect to all significant patents, there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these matters. A loss in any of these cases could adversely affect the ability of these subsidiaries to sell their products, result in loss of sales due to loss of market exclusivity, 89 require the payment of past damages and future royalties, and may result in a non-cash impairment charge for any associated intangible asset. Significant matters are described below. MedTech In August 2018, Intuitive Surgical, Inc. and Intuitive Surgical Operations, Inc. (collectively, Intuitive) filed a patent infringement suit against Auris Health, Inc. (Auris) in United States District Court for the District of Delaware. In the suit, Intuitive alleges willful infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 6,522,906 (’906); 6,800,056 (’056); 8,142,447 (’447); and 9,452,276 (’276) based on Auris’ MONARCH Platform. Auris filed IPR Petitions with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) regarding the ’056, ’447, ’276 and ’906 patents. In December 2019, the USPTO denied review of the ’056 patent. In February and March 2020, the USPTO instituted review of the ’447, and ’906 patents and denied review of the ’276 patent. In March 2021, the USPTO ruled that the challenged claims of the ’447 and ’906 patents are not invalid. Auris appealed, and in April 2022, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit vacated the decision that the ’447 patent was not invalid and remanded the decision to the USPTO for further review. In May 2022, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit confirmed the ruling that claim 53 of the ’906 patent was not invalid, vacated the decision that the remaining claims of the ’906 patent were not invalid and remanded the decision to the USPTO for further review. Auris filed a request for reexamination of the ’276 patent in November 2021, and in January 2022, the USPTO granted the reexamination request. Trial is scheduled to begin in September 2023. In August 2019, RSB Spine LLC (RSB Spine) filed a patent infringement suit against DePuy Synthes, Inc. in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. In October 2019, RSB Spine amended the complaint to change the named defendants to DePuy Synthes Sales, Inc. and DePuy Synthes Products, Inc. In the suit, RSB Spine alleges willful infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 6,984,234 (’234) and 9,713,537 (’537) by one or more of the following products: ZERO-P-VA Spacer, ZERO-P Spacer, ZERO-P NATURAL Plate, SYNFIX LR Spacer and SYNFIX Evolution System. RSB Spine seeks monetary damages and injunctive relief. In November 2019, the suit was consolidated for pre-trial purposes with other patent infringement suits brought by RSB Spine in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware against Life Spine, Inc., Medacta USA, Inc., and Precision Spine, Inc. In June 2022, DePuy filed potentially dispositive summary judgment motions that the ’234 patent is invalid as anticipated and the ’537 patent is not infringed. In November 2022, the Court granted DePuy’s summary judgment motion that the ’234 patent is invalid as anticipated and denied DePuy’s motion that the ’537 patent is not infringed. In December 2022, the Court conducted a jury trial on the ’537 patent where the jury found that the ’537 patent was not literally infringed, but that DePuy infringed under the doctrine of equivalents (DOE). The jury awarded RSB $12 million in damages subject to post-trial motions and appeals. In October 2020, Rasmussen Instruments, LLC (Rasmussen) filed a patent infringement suit against DePuy Synthes Products, Inc., DePuy Synthes Sales, Inc. and Medical Device Business Services, Inc. (collectively, DePuy) in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.

Rasmussen seeks treble damages for willful infringement. Trial concluded in March 2022, with the jury returning a verdict in favor of Rasmussen, finding willful infringement of the ’180 patent, and awarding damages in the amount of $ 20 million. DePuy challenged the verdict in its post-trial motions. In July 2022, a hearing was held on the post-trial motions. Pharmaceutical Litigation Against Filers of Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) The following summarizes lawsuits the Company’s subsidiaries have brought against generic companies that have filed ANDAs with the U.S. FDA or undertaken similar regulatory processes outside of the United States, seeking to market generic forms of products sold by various subsidiaries of the Company prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. These ANDAs typically include allegations of non-infringement and invalidity of the applicable patents. The Inter Partes Review (IPR) process with the USPTO, created under the 2011 America Invents Act, is also being used at times by generic companies in conjunction with ANDAs and lawsuits, to challenge the applicable patents. In the event the Company’s subsidiaries are not successful in an action, or the automatic statutory stay of the ANDAs expires before the United States District Court rulings are obtained, the generic companies involved would have the ability, upon approval of the U.S. FDA, to introduce generic versions of their products to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for the applicable products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. In addition, from time to time, the Company’s subsidiaries may settle these types of actions and such settlements can involve the introduction of generic versions of the products at issue to the market prior to the expiration of the relevant patents. 90 ZYTIGA Beginning in January 2019, Janssen Inc., Janssen Oncology, Inc., and BTG International Ltd.

(collectively, DRL) in response to those parties’ filing of Abbreviated New Drug Submissions (ANDS) seeking approval to market generic versions of ZYTIGA before the expiration of the Canadian Patent No. 2,661,422 (’422). The trial in these actions concluded in November 2020, and the Court issued a decision holding the ’422 patent invalid in January 2021. In February 2021, Janssen appealed the decision. The appeal hearing took place in September 2022. In November 2022, Janssen's appeal was dismissed. In April 2021, July 2021 and April 2022, respectively, Apotex, DRL and Pharmascience initiated Statements of Claim under Section 8 of the Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations against Janssen seeking damages in respect of those parties generic Zytiga tablets.

In August 2021, JPI and Bayer filed a motion before the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (the MDL panel) to transfer this lawsuit to the United States District Court for the District of Delaware for coordinated and consolidated pretrial proceedings. In December 2021, the MDL panel granted the motion. In August 2022, after receiving a second notice letter from Mylan regarding the same ANDA, JPI and Bayer filed a second patent infringement lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of West Virginia against Mylan. In September 2022, Mylan moved to dismiss the second lawsuit. In September 2022, the MDL panel transferred the second lawsuit to the District of Delaware. No trial date has been set for these two lawsuits. In October 2022, Mylan voluntarily withdrew its motion to dismiss. In each of these lawsuits, JPI and Bayer are seeking an order enjoining defendants from marketing their generic version of XARELTO (2.5 mg) before the expiration of the ’310 patent.

In November 2021, Janssen also provided to Alkermes Pharma Ireland Limited three-months’ notice of termination of a License Agreement between Elan Pharma International Limited and Janssen executed in July 2003. In April 2022, in response to these notices, Alkermes Pharma Ireland Limited (Alkermes) initiated arbitration in the International Institute for Conflict Prevention and Resolution. The parties exchanged opening briefs in July 2022 and responsive briefs in September 2022. In December 2022, the Arbitration Tribunal issued an Interim Decision finding that Janssen may terminate the agreements, but it may not continue to sell products developed during the term of the agreements without continuing to pay royalties to Alkermes. GOVERNMENT PROCEEDINGS Like other companies in the pharmaceutical, consumer health and medical devices industries, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation by national, state and local government agencies in the United States and other countries in which they operate. Such regulation has been the basis of government investigations and litigations. The most significant litigation brought by, and investigations conducted by, government agencies are listed below. It is possible that criminal charges and substantial fines and/or civil penalties or damages could result from government investigations or litigation. Average Wholesale Price (AWP) Litigation The Company and several of its pharmaceutical subsidiaries (the J&J AWP Defendants), along with numerous other pharmaceutical companies, were named as defendants in a series of lawsuits in state and federal courts involving allegations that the pricing and marketing of certain pharmaceutical products amounted to fraudulent and otherwise actionable conduct because, among other things, the companies allegedly reported an inflated Average Wholesale Price (AWP) for the drugs at issue. Payors alleged that they used those AWPs in calculating provider reimbursement levels. The plaintiffs in these cases included three classes of private persons or entities that paid for any portion of the purchase of the drugs at issue based on AWP, and state government entities that made Medicaid payments for the drugs at issue based on AWP. Many of these cases, both federal actions and state actions removed to federal court, were consolidated for pre-trial purposes in a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, where all claims against the J&J AWP Defendants were ultimately dismissed. The J&J AWP Defendants also prevailed in a case brought by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Other AWP cases have been resolved through court order or settlement. The case brought by Illinois was settled after trial. In New Jersey, a putative class action based upon AWP allegations is pending against Centocor, Inc. and Ortho Biotech Inc. (both now Janssen Biotech, Inc.), the Company and ALZA Corporation. All other cases have been resolved. Opioid Litigation Beginning in 2014 and continuing to the present, the Company and Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI), along with other pharmaceutical companies, have been named in close to 3,500 lawsuits related to the marketing of opioids, including DURAGESIC, NUCYNTA and NUCYNTA ER. The suits also raise allegations related to previously owned active pharmaceutical ingredient supplier subsidiaries, Tasmanian Alkaloids Pty, Ltd. and Noramco, Inc. (both subsidiaries were divested in 2016). The majority of the cases have been filed by state and local governments. Similar lawsuits have also been filed by private plaintiffs and organizations, including but not limited to the following: individual plaintiffs on behalf of children born with Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome; hospitals; and health insurers/payors. To date, complaints against pharmaceutical manufacturers, including the Company and JPI, have been filed by the state Attorneys General in Arkansas, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, Washington and West Virginia. Complaints against the manufacturers also have been filed in state or federal court by city, county and local government agencies in every state but Alaska. The Government of Puerto Rico filed suit in Superior Court of San Juan. 96 The Company, JPI and other pharmaceutical companies had also received subpoenas or requests for information related to opioids marketing practices from the following state Attorneys General: Alaska, Indiana, Montana, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Washington. In September 2017, the Company and JPI were contacted by the Texas and Colorado Attorney General’s Offices on behalf of approximately 38 states regarding a multi-state Attorney General investigation. In 2019, the trial in the matter filed by the Oklahoma Attorney General resulted in a judgment against the Company and JPI in the amount of $ 465 million. The Company and JPI appealed the judgment, and in November 2021, the Oklahoma Supreme Court reversed the trial court’s judgment and directed entry of judgment for Defendants. In October 2019 the Company and JPI announced a settlement of the first case set for trial in the MDL with two counties in Ohio. In April 2021, three California counties and the City of Oakland commenced a trial in California state court against the Company and JPI, and other affiliates, as well as three other pharmaceutical manufacturers. The trial concluded in October 2021, and in December 2021, the Court entered a final trial judgment in favor of Defendants on all claims. In February 2022, Plaintiffs’ motion to set aside and vacate the judgment was denied. Plaintiffs appealed the judgment, but later filed a request to dismiss the appeal after electing to participate in the national settlement agreement. In October 2019, the Company announced a proposed agreement in principle that would include the Company paying $ 4 billion as settlement of these matters that had not been tried or settled. In October 2020, the Company agreed to contribute up to an additional $ 1 billion to an all-in settlement amount that would resolve opioid lawsuits filed and future claims by states, cities, counties and tribal governments, for a total of $ 5 billion which has been accrued, subject to various conditions and an agreement being finalized. This agreement is not an admission of liability or wrong-doing. In July 2021, the Company announced that the terms of the agreement to settle the state and subdivision claims had been finalized and approximately half of the all-in settlement was expected to be paid by the end of fiscal year 2022, depending upon the level of participation by the states and their subdivisions. The terms provided a period of time for states to elect to participate in the agreement and, thereafter, a period for the subdivisions of the participating states to opt-in. Based on expected participation, the Company committed in advance to proceed with the settlement in five of the participating states (New York, Texas, Florida, Nevada, and New Mexico) and with tribal governments. By late February 2022, 45 states, five territories, the District of Columbia, and the vast majority of eligible subdivisions had elected to participate in the settlement, and the Company confirmed that the level of participation was sufficient to proceed with the agreement as to all participants. The agreement was effective in April 2022. Also in April 2022, the Company entered into settlement agreements with the states of Alabama and West Virginia and their participating subdivisions. In July 2022, the Company reached a settlement agreement with all litigating Oklahoma subdivisions, and in September 2022, the Company settled with the State of New Hampshire and its participating subdivisions. Consequently, by the end of the fiscal year 2022, the Company had settled the opioid claims advanced by all states except Washington. There are approximately 60 cases remaining post-settlement in various state courts. There are approximately 570 remaining federal cases against the Company and JPI coordinated in a federal Multi-District Litigation (MDL) pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, and approximately 20 additional cases pending against the Company and JPI in other federal courts. In addition, the Province of British Columbia filed suit against the Company and its Canadian affiliate Janssen Inc., and many other industry members, in Canada, and is seeking to have that action certified as an opt in class action on behalf of other provincial/territorial and the federal governments in Canada. Additional proposed class actions have been filed in Canada against the Company and Janssen Inc., and many other industry members, by and on behalf of people who used opioids (for personal injuries), municipalities and First Nations bands. In October 2019, an antitrust complaint was filed by private plaintiffs in federal court in Tennessee and is pending transfer to the MDL. These actions allege a variety of claims related to opioid marketing practices, including false advertising, unfair competition, public nuisance, consumer fraud violations, deceptive acts and practices, false claims and unjust enrichment. The suits generally seek penalties and/or injunctive and monetary relief and, in some of the suits, the plaintiffs are seeking joint and several liability among the defendants. An adverse judgment in any of these lawsuits could result in the imposition of large monetary penalties and significant damages including, punitive damages, cost of abatement, substantial fines, equitable remedies and other sanctions. In August 2019, the Company received a grand jury subpoena from the United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York for documents related to the Company’s anti-diversion policies and procedures and distribution of its opioid medications, in what the Company understands to be part of a broader investigation into manufacturers’ and distributors’ monitoring programs and reporting under the Controlled Substances Act. From June 2017 through December 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors received a series of shareholder demand letters alleging breaches of fiduciary duties related to the marketing of opioids. The Board retained independent counsel to investigate the allegations in the demands, and in April 2020, independent counsel delivered a report to the Board recommending that the 97 Company reject the shareholder demands and take the steps that are necessary or appropriate to secure dismissal of related derivative litigation. The Board unanimously adopted the recommendations of the independent counsel’s report. In November 2019, one of the shareholders who sent a demand filed a derivative complaint against the Company as the nominal defendant and certain current and former directors and officers as defendants in the Superior Court of New Jersey. The complaint alleges breaches of fiduciary duties related to the marketing of opioids, and that the Company has suffered damages as a result of those alleged breaches. A series of additional derivative complaints making similar allegations against the same and similar defendants were filed in New Jersey state and federal courts in 2019 and 2020. By 2022, all but two state court cases had been voluntarily dismissed. In February 2022, the state court granted the Company’s motion to dismiss one of the two cases, and the shareholder that brought the second case filed a notice of dismissal. The shareholder whose complaint was dismissed filed a motion for reconsideration. In May 2022, the state court held oral argument on the motion for reconsideration and subsequently denied the motion. The shareholder has appealed the state court’s dismissal order. Other In August 2012, DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc., DePuy, Inc. (now known as DePuy Synthes, Inc.), and Johnson & Johnson Services, Inc. (collectively DePuy) received an informal request from the United States Attorney’s Office for the District of Massachusetts and the Civil Division of the United States Department of Justice (the United States) for the production of materials relating to the DePuy ASR XL Hip device. In July 2014, the United States notified the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts that it had declined to intervene in a qui tam case filed pursuant to the False Claims Act against the companies concerning the hip devices. In February 2016, the District Court granted the companies’ motion to dismiss with prejudice, unsealed the qui tam complaint, and denied the qui tam relators’ request for leave to file a further amended complaint. The qui tam relators appealed the case to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. In July 2017, the First Circuit affirmed the District Court’s dismissal in part, reversed in part, and affirmed the decision to deny the relators’ request to file a third amended complaint. In March 2021, DePuy filed its motion to strike and dismiss the relators’ second amended complaint; the District Court denied DePuy’s motion to strike and dismiss in July 2021. DePuy filed a motion for reconsideration of the District Court’s July 2021 ruling. In November 2021, the District Court granted DePuy’s motion for reconsideration and dismissed the case with prejudice. The District Court’s order was unsealed in December 2021. The relators filed several post-dismissal motions, including a January 2022 omnibus motion for reconsideration, which the District Court denied. Following the District Court’s order dismissing the case with prejudice, DePuy filed a December 2021 motion seeking the recovery of attorneys’ fees and costs, which the District Court denied except as to costs. The Relators have appealed the District Court’s dismissal of the case to the First Circuit. The briefing on the appeal is complete, the First Circuit held oral argument on December 6, 2022, and the First Circuit’s decision remains pending. In October 2012, the Company was contacted by the California Attorney General’s office regarding a multi-state Attorney General investigation of the marketing of surgical mesh products for hernia and urogynecological purposes by the Company’s subsidiary, Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon). In May 2016, California and Washington filed civil complaints against the Company, Ethicon and Ethicon US, LLC alleging violations of their consumer protection statutes. Similar complaints were filed against the companies by the following states: Kentucky, Mississippi, West Virginia and Oregon. In April 2019, the Company and Ethicon settled the Washington case. In October 2019, the Company and Ethicon settled the multi-state investigation with 41 other states and the District of Columbia. In April 2020, the Company settled the West Virginia case. In October 2020, the Company settled with the Attorney General of Oregon. In November 2020, the Company settled with the Attorney General of Mississippi. Trial in the Kentucky matter is scheduled for June 2023. The California case started trial in July 2019 and concluded in September 2019. In January 2020, the Court in California issued a statement of decision, finding in favor of the State of California, and awarded civil penalties in the amount of $ 344 million. In April 2020, the Court in California denied the Company’s motion for a new trial. In August 2020, the Court entered judgment with respect to the penalties of $ 344 million, but denied the Attorney General’s request for injunctive relief. The Company appealed the penalty judgment. In April 2022, the Court of Appeals reduced the judgment to $ 302 million, but otherwise denied the appeal. In July 2022, the Supreme Court of California denied the Company’s petition to review the Court of Appeals decision, and the Company recorded a charge to reflect the judgment in the second quarter of 2022. In November 2022, the Company petitioned the United States Supreme Court for review. In June 2014, the Mississippi Attorney General filed a complaint in Chancery Court of The First Judicial District of Hinds County, Mississippi against the Company and Johnson & Johnson Consumer Companies, Inc. (now known as Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc.) (collectively, JJCI). The complaint alleges that JJCI violated the Mississippi Consumer Protection Act by failing to disclose alleged health risks associated with female consumers’ use of talc contained in JOHNSON’S Baby Powder and JOHNSON’S Shower to Shower (a product divested in 2012) and seeks injunctive and monetary relief. The Company and JJCI moved for summary judgment on the grounds that the State’s claim was barred by preemption, which the trial court denied. The Mississippi Supreme Court granted the Company and JJCI’s request to file an interlocutory appeal of the denial of the motion for summary judgment in late 2019. Briefing and oral argument were completed. Thereafter, the Court 98 rejected the interlocutory appeal in April 2021 and remanded the matter to the trial court. In August 2021, JJCI filed a Petition for Writ of Certiorari in the United States Supreme Court as to the Mississippi Supreme Court’s ruling of April 2021. In December 2021 the United States Supreme Court denied the Petition for Writ of Certiorari. After the Mississippi Supreme Court remanded the matter to the trial court, the State moved for a trial setting. JJCI objected to any trial setting as barred by the stay arising from the LTL Bankruptcy Case, referenced above, while the State argued that the stay did not apply. In January 2022, the Court granted the State’s motion for trial setting and directed the parties to consult with the Court administrator to secure a trial date. In February 2022, the trial court set the case for trial to begin in February 2023. However, given the efforts to resolve talc-related claims in the LTL Bankruptcy Case, the Company and the State agreed to a temporary stay of discovery until May 2022. The temporary stay expired in May 2022. LTL thereafter moved to enjoin prosecution of the case in the LTL Bankruptcy Case. In October 2022, the bankruptcy court issued an order staying the case. The State filed an appeal to the Third Circuit concerning the stay order. In January 2020, the State of New Mexico filed a consumer protection case alleging that the Company deceptively marketed and sold its talcum powder products by making misrepresentations about the safety of the products and the presence of carcinogens, including asbestos. The State of New Mexico filed an Amended Complaint in March 2020. The Company moved to dismiss certain of the claims in the Amended Complaint, which was granted. The Company then filed a motion for partial judgment on the pleadings in December 2020, which was denied. In March 2022, the New Mexico court denied the Company’s motion to compel the State of New Mexico to engage in discovery of state agencies and denied the Company’s request for interlocutory appeal of that decision. The Company then filed a Petition for Writ of Superintending Control and a Request for a Stay to the New Mexico Supreme Court on the issue of the State of New Mexico’s discovery obligations. In April 2022, in view of the efforts to resolve talc-related claims in the LTL Bankruptcy Case, the Company and the State agreed to a 60-day stay of all matters except for the pending writ before the New Mexico Supreme Court, which expired in June 2022. Thereafter, the Company moved to enjoin prosecution of the case in the LTL Bankruptcy Case. In October 2022, the bankruptcy court issued an order staying the case. In December 2022, the State filed an appeal to the Third Circuit concerning the stay order. Separately, in September 2022, the New Mexico Supreme Court granted the Company's request for a stay pending further briefing on the scope of the State of New Mexico’s discovery obligations. Forty-two states and the District of Columbia have commenced a joint investigation into the Company’s marketing of its talcum powder products. At this time, the multi-state group has not asserted any claims against the Company. Five states have issued Civil Investigative Demands seeking documents and other information. The Company has produced documents to Arizona, North Carolina, Texas, and Washington and entered into confidentiality agreements. The Company has not received any follow up requests from those states. In March 2022, each of the forty-two states (including Mississippi and New Mexico) agreed to mediation of their claims in the LTL Bankruptcy Case. In July 2022, New Mexico and Mississippi indicated they would no longer voluntarily submit to further mediation in the LTL Bankruptcy and would proceed with their respective cases in state court. LTL moved the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court for an order staying further proceedings in those two actions, which the Bankruptcy Court granted in October 2022. In December 2022, the Bankruptcy Court allowed New Mexico and Mississippi to file a direct appeal of its stay. In July 2016, the Company and Janssen Products, LP were served with a qui tam complaint pursuant to the False Claims Act filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey alleging the off-label promotion of two HIV products, PREZISTA and INTELENCE, and anti-kickback violations in connection with the promotion of these products. The complaint was filed under seal in December 2012. The federal and state governments have declined to intervene, and the lawsuit is being prosecuted by the relators. The Court denied summary judgment on all claims in December 2021. Daubert motions were granted in part and denied in part in January 2022, and the case is proceeding to trial. In March 2017, Janssen Biotech, Inc. (JBI) received a Civil Investigative Demand from the United States Department of Justice regarding a False Claims Act investigation concerning management and advisory services provided to rheumatology and gastroenterology practices that purchased REMICADE or SIMPONI ARIA. In August 2019, the United States Department of Justice notified JBI that it was closing the investigation. Subsequently, the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts unsealed a qui tam False Claims Act complaint, which was served on the Company. The Department of Justice had declined to intervene in the qui tam lawsuit in August 2019. The Company filed a motion to dismiss, which was granted in part and denied in part. Discovery is underway. In April and September 2017, the Company received subpoenas from the United States Attorney for the District of Massachusetts seeking documents broadly relating to pharmaceutical copayment support programs for DARZALEX, OLYSIO, REMICADE, SIMPONI, STELARA and ZYTIGA.

In January 2023, the Company, DePuy Synthes, Inc., and DePuy Synthes Sales Inc. entered into a settlement agreement with the United States resolving the matter for an immaterial amount. In July 2018, the Public Prosecution Service in Rio de Janeiro and representatives from the Brazilian antitrust authority CADE inspected the offices of more than 30 companies including Johnson & Johnson do Brasil Indústria e Comércio de Produtos para Saúde Ltda. The authorities appear to be investigating allegations of possible anti-competitive behavior and possible improper payments in the medical device industry. The Company continues to respond to inquiries regarding the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act from the United States Department of Justice and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. From time to time, the Company has received requests from a variety of United States Congressional Committees to produce information relevant to ongoing congressional inquiries. It is the policy of Johnson & Johnson to cooperate with these inquiries by producing the requested information. GENERAL LITIGATION Beginning in September 2017, multiple purported class actions were filed on behalf of indirect purchasers of REMICADE against the Company and Janssen Biotech, Inc. (collectively, Janssen) alleging that Janssen has violated federal antitrust laws through its contracting strategies for REMICADE.

The complaints allege that Actelion violated state and federal antitrust and unfair competition laws by allegedly refusing to supply generic pharmaceutical manufacturers with samples of TRACLEER. TRACLEER is subject to a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy required by the Food and Drug Administration, which imposes restrictions on distribution of the product. In January 2019, the plaintiffs dismissed the District of Columbia case and filed a consolidated complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland. In October 2019, the Court granted Actelion’s motion to dismiss the amended complaint. In April 2021, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed and remanded.

In January 2020, BWI filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. In August 2020, the Court granted in part and denied in part BWI’s motion to dismiss. In December 2021, BWI filed a motion for summary judgment. In March 2022, the Court granted BWI’s motion for summary judgment. In April 2022, Innovative appealed this ruling to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. In November 2019, the Company received a demand for indemnification from Pfizer Inc.

In December 2021, 101 plaintiffs in the consolidated actions filed a motion for preliminary approval of a nationwide class settlement. The settlement was preliminarily approved by the court in March 2022. The Company (subsequently substituted by Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. (JJCI)) along with more than 120 other companies, is a defendant in a cost recovery and contribution action brought by Occidental Chemical Corporation in June 2018 in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, related to the clean-up of a section of the Lower Passaic River in New Jersey. The Company or its subsidiaries are also parties to various proceedings brought under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund, and comparable state, local or foreign laws in which the primary relief sought is the cost of past and/or future remediation. 20. Restructuring In the fiscal second quarter of 2018, the Company announced plans to implement a series of actions across its Global Supply Chain that are intended to focus resources and increase investments in the critical capabilities, technologies and solutions necessary to manufacture and supply its product portfolio, enhance agility and drive growth. The Global Supply Chain actions include expanding the use of strategic collaborations and bolstering initiatives to reduce complexity, improve cost-competitiveness, enhance capabilities and optimize the Supply Chain network. In fiscal year 2022, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $ 0.5 billion, which is included on the following lines of the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, $ 0.3 billion in restructuring, $ 0.1 billion in other (income) expense and $ 0.1 billion in cost of products sold. Total project costs of approximately $ 2.2 billion have been recorded since the restructuring was announced. The program was completed in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2022. The following table summarizes the severance charges and the associated spending under these initiatives through the fiscal year ended 2022: (Dollars in Millions) Severance Asset Write-offs/Sales Other (2) Total Reserve balance, January 3, 2021 $ 135 — 9 144 2021 activity ( 23 ) — 16 ( 7 ) Reserve balance, January 2, 2022 112 — 25 137 Current year activity: Charges — 15 448 463 Cash settlements ( 37 ) 44 (3) ( 439 ) ( 432 ) Settled non cash — ( 59 ) ( 59 ) Reserve balance, January 1, 2023 (1) $ 75 — 34 109 (1) Although the restructuring program has been completed in the fiscal year 2022, the Company expects that severance charges will continue beyond that date.

(3) Represents gain on sale of assets 102 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Johnson & Johnson Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, of comprehensive income, of equity and of cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended January 1, 2023, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 1, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended January 1, 2023 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 1, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. Basis for Opinions The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. As described in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management has excluded Abiomed, Inc., (“Abiomed”) from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of January 1, 2023, because it was acquired by the Company in a business combination during 2022. We have also excluded Abiomed from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. Abiomed is a wholly-owned subsidiary whose total assets and total sales excluded from management’s assessment and our audit of internal control over financial reporting represent less than 1% of each of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the fiscal year ended January 1, 2023. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 103 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. U.S. Pharmaceutical Rebate Reserves – Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied. Rebates and discounts provided to customers are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales. The liability for such rebates and discounts is recognized within Accrued Rebates, Returns, and Promotions on the consolidated balance sheet. A significant portion of the liability related to rebates is from the sale of pharmaceutical goods within the U.S., primarily the Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid programs, which amounted to $9.6 billion as of January 1, 2023. For significant rebate programs, which include the U.S. Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid rebate programs, rebates and discounts estimated by management are based on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis, and projected market conditions in the U.S. pharmaceutical market. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to U.S. pharmaceutical rebate reserves - Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management due to the significant measurement uncertainty involved in developing these reserves and the high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and audit effort in performing procedures and evaluating the assumptions related to contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis, and projected market conditions in the U.S. pharmaceutical market. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to U.S. pharmaceutical rebate reserves - Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid, including controls over the assumptions used to estimate these rebates. These procedures also included, among others, (i) developing an independent estimate of the rebates by utilizing third party information on price and market conditions in the U.S. pharmaceutical market, the terms of the specific rebate programs, and the historical experience and trend analysis of actual rebate claims paid; (ii) testing rebate claims processed by the Company, including evaluating those claims for consistency with the contractual and mandated terms of the Company’s rebate arrangements; and (iii) comparing the independent estimates to management’s estimates. Litigation Contingencies – Talc As described in Notes 1 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with legal matters, including talc, when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. To the extent adverse awards, judgments, or verdicts have been rendered against the Company, management does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated. For these matters, management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors, including, among other things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and unpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements; complexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. Management continues to believe that the Company has strong legal grounds to contest the talc verdicts it has appealed. Notwithstanding management’s confidence in the safety of the Company’s talc products, in certain circumstances the Company has settled cases. In October 2021, Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. (Old JJCI), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, implemented a corporate restructuring and created a subsidiary, LTL Management LLC (LTL), which became solely responsible for the talc-related liabilities, and another subsidiary, New JJCI, which became responsible for the remaining business of Old JJCI. LTL filed a voluntary petition, seeking relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. As a result of the LTL bankruptcy case, the Court entered a temporary restraining order staying all litigation against LTL and Old JJCI. On November 15, 2021, the North Carolina Bankruptcy Court confirmed the scope of the stay, issuing a Preliminary Injunction (PI) prohibiting and enjoining the commencement and prosecution of talc-related claims against LTL, Old JJCI, New JJCI, Johnson & Johnson, other of their corporate affiliates, identified retailers, insurance companies, and certain other parties. The LTL Bankruptcy Case was transferred to the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey in November 2021, and that court extended the PI through the end of 104 February 2022. Claimants filed motions to dismiss the LTL Bankruptcy Case and, following a multiple day hearing, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court denied those motions by order issued in March 2022. The New Jersey Bankruptcy Court simultaneously issued another order extending the stay as to the Protected Parties. The claimants subsequently filed notices of appeal as to the denial of the motions to dismiss and the extension of the stay. In May 2022,the Third Circuit Court of Appeals granted the petitions to appeal. The briefing and oral argument on the appeal were completed in September 2022. On January 30, 2023, the Third Circuit reversed the Bankruptcy Court’s ruling and remanded to the Bankruptcy Court to dismiss the LTL bankruptcy. LTL has filed a petition for rehearing on the decision. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the talc litigation is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when assessing the likelihood of a loss being incurred and when determining whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss for the future and existing talc claims can be made, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s assessment of the loss contingencies associated with this litigation. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s evaluation of the talc litigation, including controls over determining whether a loss is probable and whether the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, as well as financial statement disclosures. These procedures also included, among others, (i) gaining an understanding of the Company’s process around the accounting and reporting for the talc litigation; (ii) discussing the status of significant known actual and potential litigation and the ongoing LTL bankruptcy proceedings with the Company’s in-house legal counsel, as well as external counsel when deemed necessary; (iii) obtaining and evaluating the letters of audit inquiry with internal and external legal counsel for significant litigation; (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assessment regarding whether an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible or probable and reasonably estimable; and (v) evaluating the sufficiency of the Company’s litigation contingencies disclosures. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Florham Park, New Jersey February 16, 2023 We have served as the Company’s auditor since at least 1920. We have not been able to determine the specific year we began serving as auditor of the Company. 105 Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, management is required to assess the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year and report, based on that assessment, whether the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective. Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the reliability of the Company’s financial reporting and the preparation of external financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal controls over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, internal control over financial reporting determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. The Company’s management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of January 1, 2023. In making this assessment, the Company used the criteria established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in “Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013).” These criteria are in the areas of control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communication, and monitoring. The Company’s assessment included extensive documenting, evaluating and testing the design and operating effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting. The Company acquired Abiomed, Inc. (Abiomed), in a business combination in December 2022. Abiomed's total assets, excluding intangible assets and goodwill, and total sales represented less than 1% of each of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the fiscal year ended January 1, 2023. As the acquisition occurred in the fiscal year 2022, the scope of the Company's assessment of the design and effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal year 2022 excluded the above mentioned acquisition. This exclusion is in accordance with the SEC's general guidance that an assessment of a recently acquired business may be omitted from the scope in the year of acquisition. Based on the Company’s processes and assessment, as described above, management has concluded that, as of January 1, 2023, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective. The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of January 1, 2023 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which appears herein. /s/ J.

The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Joaquin Duato, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Joseph J. Wolk, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, reviewed and participated in this evaluation. Based on this evaluation, Messrs. Duato and Wolk concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Report, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

Management and representatives of Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) also may from time to time make forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements do not relate strictly to historical or current facts and reflect management’s assumptions, views, plans, objectives and projections about the future. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as “plans,” “expects,” “will,” “anticipates,” “estimates” and other words of similar meaning in conjunction with, among other things: discussions of future operations; expected operating results and financial performance; impact of planned acquisitions and dispositions; impact and timing of restructuring initiatives, including associated cost savings and other benefits; the planned separation of the Company’s Consumer Health business; the Company’s strategy for growth; product development activities; regulatory approvals; market position and expenditures. Because forward-looking statements are based on current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding future events, they are subject to uncertainties, risks and changes that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of the Company’s control. Investors should realize that if underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, or known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, the Company’s actual results and financial condition could vary materially from expectations and projections expressed or implied in its forward-looking statements. Investors are therefore cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements. Risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: Risks Related to Product Development, Market Success and Competition • Challenges and uncertainties inherent in innovation and development of new and improved products and technologies on which the Company’s continued growth and success depend, including uncertainty of clinical outcomes, additional analysis of existing clinical data, obtaining regulatory approvals, health plan coverage and customer access, and initial and continued commercial success; • Challenges to the Company’s ability to obtain and protect adequate patent and other intellectual property rights for new and existing products and technologies in the United States and other important markets; • The impact of patent expirations, typically followed by the introduction of competing generic, biosimilar or other products and resulting revenue and market share losses; • Increasingly aggressive and frequent challenges to the Company’s patents by competitors and others seeking to launch competing generic, biosimilar or other products and increased receptivity of courts, the United States Patent and Trademark Office and other decision makers to such challenges, potentially resulting in loss of market exclusivity and rapid decline in sales for the relevant product sooner than expected; • Competition in research and development of new and improved products, processes and technologies, which can result in product and process obsolescence; • Competition to reach agreement with third parties for collaboration, licensing, development and marketing agreements for products and technologies; • Competition based on cost-effectiveness, product performance, technological advances and patents attained by competitors; and • Allegations that the Company’s products infringe the patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties, which could adversely affect the Company’s ability to sell the products in question and require the payment of money damages and future royalties. Risks Related to Product Liability, Litigation and Regulatory Activity • Product efficacy or safety concerns, whether or not based on scientific evidence, potentially resulting in product withdrawals, recalls, regulatory action on the part of the United States Food and Drug Administration (or international counterparts), declining sales, reputational damage, increased litigation expense and share price impact; • The impact, including declining sales and reputational damage, of significant litigation or government action adverse to the Company, including product liability claims and allegations related to pharmaceutical marketing practices and contracting strategies; • The impact of an adverse judgment or settlement and the adequacy of reserves related to legal proceedings, including patent litigation, product liability, personal injury claims, securities class actions, government investigations, employment and other legal proceedings; • Increased scrutiny of the healthcare industry by government agencies and state attorneys general resulting in investigations and prosecutions, which carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties, including, but not limited to, debarment from government business; • Failure to meet compliance obligations in compliance agreements with governments or government agencies, which could result in significant sanctions; • Potential changes to applicable laws and regulations affecting United States and international operations, including relating to: approval of new products; licensing and patent rights; sales and promotion of healthcare products; access to, and reimbursement and pricing for, healthcare products and services; environmental protection; and sourcing of raw materials; • Compliance with local regulations and laws that may restrict the Company’s ability to manufacture or sell its products in relevant markets, including requirements to comply with medical device reporting regulations and other requirements such as the European Union’s Medical Devices Regulation; • Changes in domestic and international tax laws and regulations, increasing audit scrutiny by tax authorities around the world and exposures to additional tax liabilities potentially in excess of existing reserves; and • The issuance of new or revised accounting standards by the Financial Accounting Standards Board and regulations by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Risks Related to the Company’s Strategic Initiatives, Healthcare Market Trends and the Planned Separation of the Company’s Consumer Health Business • Pricing pressures resulting from trends toward healthcare cost containment, including the continued consolidation among healthcare providers and other market participants, trends toward managed care, the shift toward governments increasingly becoming the primary payers of healthcare expenses, significant new entrants to the healthcare markets seeking to reduce costs and government pressure on companies to voluntarily reduce costs and price increases; • Restricted spending patterns of individual, institutional and governmental purchasers of healthcare products and services due to economic hardship and budgetary constraints; • Challenges to the Company’s ability to realize its strategy for growth including through externally sourced innovations, such as development collaborations, strategic acquisitions, licensing and marketing agreements, and the potential heightened costs of any such external arrangements due to competitive pressures; • The potential that the expected strategic benefits and opportunities from any planned or completed acquisition or divestiture by the Company may not be realized or may take longer to realize than expected; • The potential that the expected benefits and opportunities related to past and ongoing restructuring actions may not be realized or may take longer to realize than expected; • The Company’s ability to consummate the planned separation of the Company’s Consumer Health business on a timely basis or at all; • The Company’s ability to successfully separate the Company’s Consumer Health business and realize the anticipated benefits from the planned separation; and • The New Consumer Health Company’s ability to succeed as a standalone publicly traded company. Risks Related to Economic Conditions, Financial Markets and Operating Internationally • The risks associated with global operations on the Company and its customers and suppliers, including foreign governments in countries in which the Company operates; • The impact of inflation and fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates and the potential effect of such fluctuations on revenues, expenses and resulting margins; • Potential changes in export/import and trade laws, regulations and policies of the United States and other countries, including any increased trade restrictions or tariffs and potential drug reimportation legislation; • The impact on international operations from financial instability in international economies, sovereign risk, possible imposition of governmental controls and restrictive economic policies, and unstable international governments and legal systems; • The impact of global public health crises and pandemics, including the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic; • Changes to global climate, extreme weather and natural disasters that could affect demand for the Company’s products and services, cause disruptions in manufacturing and distribution networks, alter the availability of goods and services within the supply chain, and affect the overall design and integrity of the Company’s products and operations; and • The impact of armed conflicts and terrorist attacks in the United States and other parts of the world, including social and economic disruptions and instability of financial and other markets. Risks Related to Supply Chain and Operations • Difficulties and delays in manufacturing, internally, through third-party providers or otherwise within the supply chain, that may lead to voluntary or involuntary business interruptions or shutdowns, product shortages, withdrawals or suspensions of products from the market, and potential regulatory action; • Interruptions and breaches of the Company’s information technology systems or those of the Company’s vendors, which could result in reputational, competitive, operational or other business harm as well as financial costs and regulatory action; • Reliance on global supply chains and production and distribution processes that are complex and subject to increasing regulatory requirements that may adversely affect supply, sourcing and pricing of materials used in the Company’s products; and • The potential that the expected benefits and opportunities related to restructuring actions contemplated for the global supply chain may not be realized or may take longer to realize than expected, including due to any required approvals from applicable regulatory authorities. Investors also should carefully read the Risk Factors described in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of certain risks that could, among other things, cause the Company’s actual results to differ materially from those expressed in its forward-looking statements. Investors should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and should not consider the risks described above and in Item 1A to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. The Company does not undertake to publicly update any forward-looking statement that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information or future events or developments. PART I Item 1. BUSINESS General Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 141,700 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the healthcare field. Johnson & Johnson is a holding company, with operating companies conducting business in virtually all countries of the world. The Company’s primary focus is products related to human health and well-being. Johnson & Johnson was incorporated in the State of New Jersey in 1887. The Executive Committee of Johnson & Johnson is the principal management group responsible for the strategic operations and allocation of the resources of the Company. This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities of the Company's three business segments: Consumer Health, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. Within the strategic parameters provided by the Committee, senior management groups at U.S. and international operating companies are each responsible for their own strategic plans and the day-to-day operations of those companies. Each subsidiary within the business segments is, with limited exceptions, managed by residents of the country where located. Segments of Business The Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer Health, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. Additional information required by this item is incorporated herein by reference to the narrative and tabular descriptions of segments and operating results under: “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition” of this Report; and Note 17 “Segments of Business and Geographic Areas” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Consumer Health The Consumer Health segment includes a broad range of products focused on personal healthcare used in the Skin Health/Beauty, Over-the-Counter medicines, Baby Care, Oral Care, Women’s Health and Wound Care markets. Major brands in Skin Health/Beauty include the AVEENO ® ; CLEAN & CLEAR ® ; DR. CI:LABO ® ; NEUTROGENA ® and OGX ® product lines. Over-the-Counter (OTC) medicines include the broad family of TYLENOL ® acetaminophen products; SUDAFED ® cold, flu and allergy products; BENADRYL ® and ZYRTEC ® allergy products; MOTRIN ® IB ibuprofen products; NICORETTE ® smoking cessation products outside the U.S.; ZARBEE’S ® products, inspired by nature, and the PEPCID ® line of acid reflux products.

These products are marketed to the general public and sold online (eCommerce) and to retail outlets and distributors throughout the world.

The Company is targeting completion of the planned separation in 18 to 24 months after initial announcement.

Many of these medicines were developed in collaboration with strategic partners or are licensed from other companies and maintain active lifecycle development programs. Medical Devices The Medical Devices segment includes a broad range of products used in the Interventional Solutions, Orthopaedics, Surgery, and Vision fields. Medical Devices in Interventional Solutions include Electrophysiology products (Biosense Webster) to treat cardiovascular diseases, Neurovascular care (Cerenovus) that treats hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke; the Orthopaedics portfolio (DePuy Synthes) is comprised of products in support of Hips, Knees, Trauma, and Spine, Sports & Other; the Surgery portfolios include advanced and general surgery offerings (Ethicon), solutions that focus on Breast Aesthetics (Mentor) and Ear, Nose and Throat (Acclarent) procedures; and Johnson & Johnson Vision products such as ACUVUE ® Brand disposable contact lenses and ophthalmic products related to cataract and laser refractive surgery. These products are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used predominantly in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics. Beginning in the fiscal first quarter of 2022, the Medical Devices segment will be referred to as the MedTech segment. Geographic Areas Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 141,700 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the healthcare field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world with the primary focus on products related to human health and well-being. The products made and sold in the international business include many of those described above under “– Segments of Business – Consumer Health,” “– Pharmaceutical” and “– Medical Devices.” However, the principal markets, products and methods of distribution in the international business vary with the country and the culture. The products sold in international business include those developed in the U.S. and by subsidiaries abroad. Investments and activities in some countries outside the U.S. are subject to higher risks than comparable U.S. activities because the investment and commercial climate may be influenced by financial instability in international economies, restrictive economic policies and political and legal system uncertainties. Raw Materials Raw materials essential to the Company's business are generally readily available from multiple sources. Where there are exceptions, the temporary unavailability of those raw materials would not likely have a material adverse effect on the financial results of the Company. Patents The Company's subsidiaries have made a practice of obtaining patent protection on their products and processes where possible. They own, or are licensed under, a significant number of patents in the U.S. and other countries relating to their products, product uses, formulations and manufacturing processes, which in the aggregate are believed to be of material importance to the Company in the operation of its businesses. The Company’s subsidiaries face patent challenges from third parties, including challenges seeking to manufacture and market generic and biosimilar versions of the Company's key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. Significant legal proceedings and 2 claims involving the Company's patent and other intellectual property are described in Note 19, “Legal Proceedings— Intellectual Property” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Sales of the Company’s largest product, STELARA ® (ustekinumab), accounted for approximately 9.7% of the Company's total revenues for fiscal 2021. Accordingly, the patents related to this product are believed to be material to the Company. Janssen Biotech, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, owns patents specifically related to STELARA ® . The latest expiring United States composition of matter patent expires in 2023. The latest expiring European composition of matter patent expires in 2024. Sales of the Company’s second largest product, collectively DARZALEX ® (daratumumab) and DARZALEX FASPRO ® (daratumumab and hyaluronidase-fihj), accounted for approximately 6.4% of the Company's total revenues for fiscal 2021. Accordingly, the patents related to this product are believed to be material to the Company. Genmab A/S owns two patent families related to DARZALEX ® , and Janssen Biotech, Inc. has an exclusive license to those patent families. The two patent families both expire in the United States in 2029. The latest expiring licensed European patent expires in 2032. Janssen Biotech, Inc. owns a separate patent portfolio related to DARZALEX FASPRO ® . Trademarks The Company’s subsidiaries have made a practice of selling their products under trademarks and of obtaining protection for these trademarks by all available means. These trademarks are protected by registration in the U.S. and other countries where such products are marketed. The Company considers these trademarks in the aggregate to be of material importance in the operation of its businesses. Seasonality Worldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality; however, spending has been heavier in the fourth quarter of each year than in other quarters. This reflects increased spending decisions, principally for advertising and research and development activity. Competition In all of their product lines, the Company's subsidiaries compete with companies both locally and globally. Competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved. Competition in research, both internally and externally sourced, involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. The development of new and innovative products, as well as protecting the underlying intellectual property of the Company’s product portfolio, is important to the Company's success in all areas of its business. The competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research. In addition, the development and maintenance of customer demand for the Company’s consumer products involve significant expenditures for advertising and promotion. Environment The Company is subject to a variety of U.S. and international environmental protection measures. The Company believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations. The Company’s compliance with these requirements is not expected to have a material effect upon its capital expenditures, cash flows, earnings or competitive position. Regulation The Company’s businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which operations are conducted, and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation and enforcement. The Company is subject to costly and complex U.S. and foreign laws and governmental regulations and any adverse regulatory action may materially adversely affect the Company's financial condition and business operations. In the U.S., the drug, device and cosmetic industries have long been subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies, primarily as to product safety, efficacy, manufacturing, advertising, labeling and safety reporting. The exercise of broad regulatory powers by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the U.S. FDA) continues to result in increases in the amounts of testing and documentation required for U.S. FDA approval of new drugs and devices and a corresponding increase in the expense of product introduction. Similar trends are also evident in major markets outside of the U.S. The new medical device regulatory framework and the new privacy regulations in Europe and in other countries are examples of such increased regulation. The regulatory agencies under whose purview the Company operates have administrative powers that may subject it to actions such as product withdrawals, recalls, seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions. In some cases, the Company’s subsidiaries may deem it advisable to initiate product recalls. The U.S. FDA and regulatory agencies around the globe are also increasing their enforcement activities. If the U.S. FDA were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our drugs or medical 3 devices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, the U.S. FDA could ban such products, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded products, order a recall, repair, replacement, or refund of such products, refuse to grant pending applications for marketing authorization or require certificates of foreign governments for exports, and/or require us to notify health professionals and others that the products present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The U.S. FDA may also assess civil or criminal penalties against us, our officers or employees and impose operating restrictions on a company-wide basis, or enjoin and/or restrain certain conduct resulting in violations of applicable law. The U.S. FDA may also recommend prosecution to the U.S. Department of Justice. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict us from effectively marketing and selling our products and limit our ability to obtain future clearances or approvals, and could result in a substantial modification to our business practices and operations. Equivalent enforcement mechanisms exist in different countries in which we conduct business. The costs of human healthcare have been and continue to be a subject of study, investigation and regulation by governmental agencies and legislative bodies around the world. In the U.S., attention has been focused by states, regulatory agencies and congress on drug prices and profits and programs that encourage doctors to write prescriptions for particular drugs, or to recommend, use or purchase particular medical devices. Laws and regulations have been enacted to require adherence to strict compliance standards and prevent fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. There is increased focus on interactions and financial relationships between healthcare companies and healthcare providers. Various transparency laws and regulations require disclosures of payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals and, beginning with disclosures in 2022, to certain non-physician practitioners. Federal and foreign laws governing international business practices require strict compliance with anti-bribery standards and certain prohibitions with respect to payments to any foreign government official. Payers have become a more potent force in the market place and increased attention is being paid to drug and medical device pricing, appropriate drug and medical device utilization and the quality and costs of healthcare generally. U.S. government actors continue efforts to repeal, modify, or invalidate provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the ACA) which passed in 2010. For example, federal legislation repealed the ACA’s individual mandate tax penalty as well as the tax on generous employer-sponsored healthcare plans; the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) began permitting states to impose work requirements on persons covered by Medicaid expansion plans; certain federal subsidies to insurers have ended; and certain short-term insurance plans not offering the full array of ACA benefits have been allowed to extend in duration. Some of these changes are being challenged in U.S. courts and so their long-term impact remains uncertain. The ACA has also been subject to judicial challenge. In November 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court heard argument in Texas v. Azar , which challenges the constitutionality of the ACA. Pending resolution of the litigation, all of the ACA but the individual mandate to buy health insurance remains in effect. The U.S. government also continues to propose and implement changes to the Medicare Part D benefit including the size of manufacturer discounts in the coverage gap and catastrophic phases of the benefit. There are a number of additional bills pending in Congress and healthcare reform proposals at the state level that would affect drug pricing in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This changing federal landscape has both positive and negative impacts on the U.S. healthcare industry with much remaining uncertain as to how various provisions of federal law, and potential modification or repeal of these laws, will ultimately affect the industry. In addition, business practices in the healthcare industry have come under increased scrutiny, particularly in the U.S., by government agencies and state attorneys general, and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties. Further, the Company relies on global supply chains, and production and distribution processes, that are complex, are subject to increasing regulatory requirements, and may be faced with unexpected changes such as those resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and Brexit that may affect sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in the Company's products. These processes also are subject to complex and lengthy regulatory approvals. The global regulatory landscape is also subject to change as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect the U.S. and global economies. The U.S. FDA and other health authorities have shifted resources and priorities to meet the many challenges presented by the pandemic. Pandemic-related disruptions could negatively impact the processing of regulatory submissions and slow agency review times necessary for the approval or clearance of new drugs and devices. The duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic is unpredictable and difficult to assess. 4 Employees and Human Capital Management As of January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021, the number of employees were approximately: 2021 2020 Employees 1 144,300 136,400 Full-time equivalent (FTE) positions 2 141,700 134,500 1 “Employee” is defined as an individual working full-time or part-time, excluding fixed term employees, interns and co-op employees. Employee data may not include full population from more recently acquired companies and individuals on long-term disability are excluded. Contingent workers, contractors and subcontractors are also excluded. 2 FTE represents the total number of full-time equivalent positions and does not reflect the total number of individual employees as some work part-time. Strategy The Company believes that its employees are critical to its continued success and are an essential element of its long-term strategy. Management is responsible for ensuring that its policies and processes reflect and reinforce the Company's desired corporate culture, including policies and processes related to strategy, risk management, and ethics and compliance. The Company’s human capital management strategy is built on three fundamental focus areas: • Attracting and recruiting the best talent • Developing and retaining talent • Empowering and inspiring talent Underpinning these focus areas are ongoing efforts to cultivate and foster a culture built on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), innovation, health, well-being and safety, where the Company's employees are encouraged to succeed both professionally and personally while helping the Company achieve its business goals. Culture and Employee Engagement At Johnson & Johnson, employees are guided by Our Credo which sets forth the Company's responsibilities to patients, consumers, customers, healthcare professionals, employees, communities and shareholders. Employees worldwide are further guided by the Company’s Code of Business Conduct which sets basic requirements for business conduct and serves as a foundation for the Company policies, procedures and guidelines, all of which provide additional guidance on expected employee behaviors in every market where it operates. The Company conducts global surveys that offer its employees the ability to provide feedback and valuable insight to help address potential human resources risks and identify opportunities to improve. In 2021, 91% of global employees across 77 countries participated in Our Voice Survey which was offered in 36 languages. Growth and Development To continue to lead in the changing healthcare landscape, it is crucial that the Company continue to attract and retain top talent. The Company believes that its employees must be equipped with the right knowledge and skills and be provided with opportunities to grow and develop in their careers. Accordingly, professional development programs and educational resources 5 5 are available to all employees. The Company's objective is to foster a learning culture that helps shape each person’s unique career path while creating a robust pipeline of talent to deliver on the Company’s long-term strategies. In furtherance of this objective, the Company deploys a global approach to ensure development is for everyone, regardless of where they are on their career journey. In 2021, 45.8% of employees in Manager and above job categories took advantage of career opportunities by moving across functions, country or business segment lines (including upward promotion or lateral transfer and excluding employees in the research and development organizations). The Company's voluntary turnover rate was 8%. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) The Company is committed to workplace diversity and to cultivating, fostering, and advancing a culture of equity and inclusion. Enabling employees to perform at their best while being themselves is fundamental to the Company's continued success. The Company’s DEI vision is: Be yourself, change the world . The Company's DEI strategy focuses on three pillars that reflect the strategic priorities identified to enable the Company to address the challenges and opportunities presented by this evolving understanding of diversity: • Accelerate the Company’s efforts to advance a culture of inclusion and innovation • Build a diverse workforce for the future • Enhance business results and reputation The Company's DEI strategy is guided by internal and external insights, global best practices and continual employee feedback which remind the Company that while diversity changes by location, inclusion is the same everywhere. Compensation and Benefits As part of the Company's total rewards philosophy, the Company offers competitive compensation and benefits to attract and retain top talent. The Company is committed to fairness and equitable treatment in its compensation and benefits for employees at all levels. The Company observes legal minimum wage provisions and exceeds them where possible. The Company's total rewards offerings include an array of programs to support its employees' financial, physical, and mental well-being, including annual performance incentive opportunities, pension and retirement savings programs, health and welfare benefits, paid time off, leave programs, flexible work schedules and employee assistance programs. Health, Wellness and Safety The Company’s investment in employee health, well-being and safety is built on its conviction that advancing health for humanity starts with advancing the health of its employees. With the right awareness, focus, practices and tools, the Company ensures that all its employees around the world, as well as temporary contractors and visitors to the Company's sites, can work safely. The Company has continuously expanded health and well-being programs throughout the Company and across the globe, incorporating new thinking and technologies to keep its offerings best-in-class and to help employees achieve their personal health goals. The programs and practices the Company advances for total health—physical, mental, emotional and financial—help ensure employee health protection from emerging health risks. Safety and COVID-19 Pandemic Response Protecting and supporting our employees during the COVID-19 pandemic continues to be a top priority and our approach includes: keeping employees informed of local COVID-19 transmission rates and corresponding risk levels; promoting the health and safety of our employees in the workplace through robust layers of protection; enhanced cleaning and access to cleaning supplies and personal protective equipment; supporting employees with pay continuity, benefits and well-being tools; and recognizing extraordinary employee contributions at work and in our communities. In 2021, in recognition of the new way of working, we initiated J&J Flex, a hybrid model that empowers our office-based employees to find the right productivity and balance of in-person and remote work. This model allows for work to happen seamlessly across a variety of workplaces and is enabled by an array of enhanced collaboration tools and technology to optimize productivity and connection. J&J Flex rolled out in fourth quarter 2021 globally, and will continue deployment through 2022 as protocol and requirements related to the COVID-19 pandemic allow. The Company is evaluating flexible work strategies for its on-site workforce, such as virtual on-boarding and training, to help our employees balance their personal and professional lives. Also, we continued to enhance our benefits offerings with access to wellness tools, on-site vaccine clinics, mental health support resources and delivery of at-home testing kits. In addition, as COVID-19 vaccines were broadly distributed and administered in 2021, including the one developed by Johnson & Johnson, we adopted policies in the U.S., Puerto Rico, and certain other countries to require proof of vaccination from Johnson & Johnson employees and contingent workers, in order to return to our sites, where permitted by local law and regulation. In the U.S. and Puerto Rico, this requirement took effect on October 4, 2021, with processes established for granting accommodations to those with medical or religious needs. Select manufacturing and distribution employees and contractors in the U.S. and Puerto Rico, as well as certain additional countries, are adopting similar policies through early 2022. 6 Available Information The Company’s main corporate website address is www.jnj.com .

RISK FACTORS An investment in the Company’s common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties. The Company seeks to identify, manage and mitigate risks to our business, but uncertainties and risks are difficult to predict and many are outside of the Company’s control and cannot therefore be eliminated. In addition to the other information in this report and the Company’s other filings with the SEC, investors should consider carefully the factors set forth below. Investors should be aware that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and that the following is not meant to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties. If known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, the Company’s business, results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected, potentially in a material way. Risks Related to Our Business, Industry and Operations The Company’s businesses operate in highly competitive product markets and competitive pressures could adversely affect the Company’s earnings. The Company faces substantial competition in all three operating segments and in all geographic markets. The Company’s businesses compete with companies of all sizes on the basis of cost-effectiveness, technological innovations, intellectual property rights, product performance, real or perceived product advantages, pricing and availability and rate of reimbursement. The Company also competes with other market participants in securing rights to acquisitions, collaborations and licensing agreements with third parties. Competition for rights to product candidates and technologies may result in significant investment and acquisition costs and onerous agreement terms for the Company. Competitors’ development of more effective or less costly products, and/or their ability to secure patent and other intellectual property rights and successfully market products ahead of the Company, could negatively impact sales of the Company’s existing products as well as its ability to bring new products to market despite significant prior investment in the related product development. For the Company’s Pharmaceutical businesses, loss of patent exclusivity for a product often is followed by a substantial reduction in sales as competitors gain regulatory approval for generic and other competing products and enter the market. Similar competition can be triggered by the loss of exclusivity for a biological product. For the Company’s Medical Devices businesses, technological innovation, product quality, reputation and customer service are especially important to competitiveness. Development by other companies of new or improved products, processes and technologies could threaten to make the Company’s products or technologies less desirable, less economical or obsolete. The Company’s Consumer Health businesses face intense competition from other branded products and retailers’ private-label brands. If the Company fails to sufficiently differentiate and market its brand name consumer products, this could adversely affect revenues and profitability of those products. Interruptions and delays in manufacturing operations could adversely affect the Company’s business, sales and reputation. The Company’s manufacture of products requires the timely delivery of sufficient amounts of complex, high-quality components and materials. The Company’s subsidiaries operate 85 manufacturing facilities as well as sourcing from thousands of suppliers around the world. The Company has in the past, and may in the future, face unanticipated interruptions and delays in manufacturing through its internal or external supply chain. Manufacturing disruptions can occur for many reasons including regulatory action, production quality deviations or safety issues, labor disputes, labor shortages, site-specific incidents (such as fires), natural disasters such as hurricanes and other severe weather events, raw material shortages, political unrest, terrorist attacks and epidemics or pandemics. Such delays and difficulties in manufacturing can result in product shortages, declines in sales and reputational impact as well as significant remediation and related costs associated with addressing the shortage. The Company relies on third parties to manufacture certain of our products. Any failure by or loss of a third-party manufacturer could result in delays and increased costs, which may adversely affect our business. The Company relies on third parties to manufacture certain of our products. We depend on these third-party manufacturers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis and at acceptable prices. However, we cannot guarantee that these third-party manufacturers will be able to meet our near-term or long-term manufacturing requirements, which could result in lost sales and have an adverse effect on our business. Other risks associated with our reliance on third parties to manufacture these products include reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance, misappropriation of the Company’s intellectual property, limited ability to manage our inventory, possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party and the possible termination or nonrenewal of the manufacturing agreement by the third party at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us. Moreover, if any of our third-party manufacturers suffers any damage to facilities, loses benefits under material agreements, experiences power outages, encounters financial difficulties, is unable to secure necessary raw materials from its suppliers or suffers any other reduction in efficiency, the Company may experience significant business disruption. In the event of any such disruption, the 8 Company would need to seek and source other qualified third-party manufacturers, likely resulting in further delays and increased costs which could affect our business adversely. Counterfeit versions of our products could harm our patients and have a negative impact on our revenues, earnings, reputation and business. Our industry continues to be challenged by the vulnerability of distribution channels to illegal counterfeiting and the presence of counterfeit products in a growing number of markets and over the Internet. Third parties may illegally distribute and sell counterfeit versions of our products, which do not meet our rigorous manufacturing and testing standards. To distributors and patients, counterfeit products may be visually indistinguishable from the authentic version. Counterfeit medicines pose a risk to patient health and safety because of the conditions under which they are manufactured – often in unregulated, unlicensed, uninspected and unsanitary sites – as well as the lack of regulation of their contents. The industry’s failure to mitigate the threat of counterfeit medicines could adversely impact our business and reputation by impacting patient confidence in our authentic products, potentially resulting in lost sales, product recalls, and an increased threat of litigation. In addition, diversion of our products from their authorized market into other channels may result in reduced revenues and negatively affect our profitability. The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted certain aspects of the Company’s business and could cause disruptions or future impact to the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. We are subject to risks associated with global health crises, epidemics and pandemics, including the global outbreak of coronavirus and its variants (COVID-19). The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted, and is expected to continue to adversely impact, certain aspects of the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition, including lower sales and reduced customer demand and usage of certain of our products. The spread of COVID-19 has caused the Company to modify its business practices (including instituting remote work for many of the Company’s employees), and the Company may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or as the Company determines are in the best interests of our patients, customers, employees and business partners. The Company continues to monitor the situation and while we have robust business continuity plans in place across our global supply chain network to help mitigate the impact of COVID-19, these efforts may not completely prevent our business from being adversely affected and future impacts remain uncertain. While the U.S. and other countries have begun or will begin to reopen their economies, the extent to which COVID-19 will impact the Company’s future operations will depend on many factors which cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration of the outbreak and impact of variants. Any resurgence in COVID-19 could result in the imposition of new mandates and prolonged restrictive measures implemented in order to control the spread of the disease. The continued global spread of COVID-19 could adversely impact the Company’s operations, including, among other things, our manufacturing operations, supply chain, including third-party suppliers, sales and marketing and clinical trial operations. Any of these factors could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial results, and global economic conditions generally. We also face uncertainties related to our COVID-19 vaccine, including uncertainties related to the risk that our continued development programs may not be successful, commercially viable or receive approval from regulatory authorities; risks associated with clinical trial and real-world data, including further analyses of its efficacy, safety and durability; the risk that data are subject to differing interpretations and assessments, including during the peer review/publication process, in the scientific community generally, and by national immunization technical advisory groups (NITAGs) and regulatory authorities; disruptions in the relationships between us, our third-party suppliers and external manufacturers; the risk that other companies may produce superior or competitive products; the risk that demand for any products we may develop may no longer exist; risks related to the availability of raw materials to manufacture any such products; the risk that we may not be able to recoup costs associated with our R&D and manufacturing efforts and risks associated with any changes in the way we approach or provide additional research funding for potential drug development related to COVID-19; the risk that we may not be able to create or scale up manufacturing capacity on a timely basis, that we may continue to experience manufacturing delays once a manufacturing site is activated, or have access to logistics or supply channels commensurate with global demand for any potential approved vaccine or product candidate, which would negatively impact our ability to supply the estimated numbers of doses of our vaccine within the projected time periods indicated, and other challenges and risks associated with the pace of our vaccine development program; and pricing and access challenges for such products, including in the U.S. In addition, to the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section and those incorporated by reference herein, i ncluding risks relating to the Company’s effective tax rate as a result of changes in consumption as well as changes in laws relating to supply of the Company’s products . Given that developments concerning the COVID-19 pandemic have been constantly evolving, additional impacts and risks may arise, including litigation, that are not presently known to the Company. 9 Risks Related to Government Regulation and Legal Proceedings Global sales in the Company’s Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices segments may be negatively impacted by healthcare reforms and increasing pricing pressures. Sales of the Company’s Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices products are significantly affected by reimbursements by third-party payers such as government healthcare programs, private insurance plans and managed care organizations. As part of various efforts to contain healthcare costs, these payers are putting downward pressure on prices at which products will be reimbursed. In the U.S., increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of Medicare, Medicaid, and private sector beneficiaries, in part due to continued consolidation among healthcare providers, could result in further pricing pressures. In addition, increased political scrutiny could result in additional pricing pressures. Outside the U.S., numerous major markets, including the EU, United Kingdom, Japan and China, have pervasive government involvement in funding healthcare and, in that regard, directly or indirectly impose price controls, limit access to, or reimbursement for, the Company’s products, or reduce the value of its intellectual property protection. The Company is subject to significant legal proceedings that can result in significant expenses, fines and reputational damage. In the ordinary course of business, Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims and lawsuits involving various issues such as product liability, patent disputes and claims that their product sales, marketing and pricing practices violate various antitrust, unfair trade practices and/or consumer protection laws. The Company’s more significant legal proceedings are described in Note 19, “Legal Proceedings” under Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Litigation, in general, and securities, derivative action, class action and multi-district litigation, in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. Some of these matters may include thousands of plaintiffs, may involve parties seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages, and may remain unresolved for several years. For example, the Company is a defendant in numerous lawsuits arising out of the use of body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S ® Baby Powder, and the Company’s sale, manufacturing and marketing of opioids. While the Company believes it has substantial defenses in these matters, it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation. The Company could in the future be required to pay significant amounts as a result of settlements or judgments in these matters, potentially in excess of accruals, including matters where the Company could be held jointly and severally liable among other defendants. The resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and cash flows for that period. The Company does not purchase third-party product liability insurance; however, the Company utilizes a wholly owned captive insurance company subject to certain limits. Product reliability, safety and effectiveness concerns can have significant negative impacts on sales and results of operations, lead to litigation and cause reputational damage. Concerns about product safety, whether raised internally or by litigants, regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence, can result in safety alerts, product recalls, governmental investigations, regulatory action on the part of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (or its counterpart in other countries), private claims and lawsuits, payment of fines and settlements, declining sales and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in the Company’s products. Product recalls have in the past, and could in the future, prompt government investigations and inspections, the shutdown of manufacturing facilities, continued product shortages and related sales declines, significant remediation costs, reputational damage, possible civil penalties and criminal prosecution. The Company faces significant regulatory scrutiny, which imposes significant compliance costs and exposes the Company to government investigations, legal actions and penalties. Like other companies in the healthcare industry, the Company is subject to extensive regulation, investigations and legal action by national, state and local government agencies in the U.S. and other countries in which it operates. Regulatory issues regarding compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) (and comparable quality regulations in foreign countries) by manufacturers of drugs, devices and consumer products can lead to fines and penalties, product recalls, product shortages, interruptions in production, delays in new product approvals and litigation. In addition, the marketing, pricing and sale of the Company’s products are subject to regulation, investigations and legal actions including under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Medicaid Rebate Program, federal and state false claims acts, state unfair trade practices acts and consumer protection laws. Scrutiny of healthcare industry business practices by government agencies and state attorneys general in the U.S., and any resulting investigations and prosecutions, carry risk of significant civil and criminal penalties including, but not limited to, debarment from participation in government healthcare programs. Any such debarment could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations. The most significant current investigations and litigation brought by government agencies are described in Note 19, “Legal Proceedings—Government Proceedings” under Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. 10 Changes in tax laws or exposures to additional tax liabilities could negatively impact the Company’s operating results. Changes in tax laws or regulations around the world, including in the U.S. and as led by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, could negatively impact the Company’s effective tax rate and results of operations. A change in statutory tax rate or certain international tax provisions in any country would result in the revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the period in which the new tax law is enacted. This change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The Company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the countries where it operates. Changes to tax laws or regulations may occur at any time, and any related expense or benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted. See Note 8, “Income Taxes” under Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report for additional information. The Company conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and is addressing tax audits and disputes with many tax authorities. In connection with various government initiatives, companies are required to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in other countries. The Company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of its tax audits and disputes to determine the appropriateness of its tax reserves. However, any tax authority could take a position on tax treatment that is contrary to the Company’s expectations, which could result in tax liabilities in excess of reserves. Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property The Company faces increased challenges to intellectual property rights central to its business. The Company owns or licenses a significant number of patents and other proprietary rights relating to its products and manufacturing processes. These rights are essential to the Company’s businesses and materially important to the Company’s results of operations. Public policy, both within and outside the U.S., has become increasingly unfavorable toward intellectual property rights. The Company cannot be certain that it will obtain adequate patent protection for new products and technologies in the United States and other important markets or that such protections, once granted, will last as long as originally anticipated. Competitors routinely challenge the validity or extent of the Company’s owned or licensed patents and proprietary rights through litigation, interferences, oppositions and other proceedings, such as inter partes review (IPR) proceedings before the United States Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO). These proceedings absorb resources and can be protracted as well as unpredictable. In addition, challenges that the Company’s products infringe the patents of third parties could result in an injunction and/or the need to pay past damages and future royalties and adversely affect the competitive position and sales of the products in question. The Company has faced increasing patent challenges from third parties seeking to manufacture and market generic and biosimilar versions of the Company’s key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. In the U.S., manufacturers of generic versions of innovative human pharmaceutical products may challenge the validity, or claim non-infringement, of innovator products through the Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, process with the U.S. FDA and related ANDA litigation. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA), enacted in 2010, which created a new regulatory pathway for the approval by the U.S. FDA of biosimilar alternatives to innovator-developed biological products, also created mechanisms for biosimilar applicants to challenge the patents on the innovator biologics. The IPR process with the USPTO is also being used by competitors to challenge patents asserted in litigation. In the event the Company is not successful in defending its patents against such challenges, or upon the “at-risk” launch by the generic or biosimilar firm of its product, the Company can lose a major portion of revenues for the referenced product in a very short period of time. Current legal proceedings involving the Company’s patents and other intellectual property rights are described in Note 19, “Legal Proceedings—Intellectual Property” under Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Risks Related to Product Development, Regulatory Approval and Commercialization Significant challenges or delays in the Company’s innovation and development of new products, technologies and indications could have an adverse impact on the Company’s long-term success. The Company’s continued growth and success depends on its ability to innovate and develop new and differentiated products and services that address the evolving healthcare needs of patients, providers and consumers. Development of successful 11 products and technologies is also necessary to offset revenue losses when the Company’s existing products lose market share due to various factors such as competition and loss of patent exclusivity. New products introduced within the past five years accounted for approximately 25% of 2021 sales. The Company cannot be certain when or whether it will be able to develop, license or otherwise acquire companies, products and technologies, whether particular product candidates will be granted regulatory approval, and, if approved, whether the products will be commercially successful. The Company pursues product development through internal research and development as well as through collaborations, acquisitions, joint ventures and licensing or other arrangements with third parties. In all of these contexts, developing new products, particularly pharmaceutical and biotechnology products and medical devices, requires significant investment of resources over many years. Only a very few biopharmaceutical research and development programs result in commercially viable products. The process depends on many factors including the ability to: discern patients’ and healthcare providers’ future needs; develop promising new compounds, strategies and technologies; achieve successful clinical trial results; secure effective intellectual property protection; obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis; and, if and when they reach the market, successfully differentiate the Company’s products from competing products and approaches to treatment. New products or enhancements to existing products may not be accepted quickly or significantly in the marketplace due to product and price competition, changes in customer preferences or healthcare purchasing patterns, resistance by healthcare providers or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. Even following initial regulatory approval, the success of a product can be adversely impacted by safety and efficacy findings in larger real-world patient populations, as well as market entry of competitive products. Risks Related to Financial and Economic Market Conditions The Company faces a variety of financial, economic, legal, social and political risks associated with conducting business internationally . The Company’s extensive operations and business activity throughout the world are accompanied by certain financial, economic, legal, social and political risks, including those listed below. Foreign Currency Exchange : In fiscal 2021, approximately 50% of the Company’s sales occurred outside of the U.S., with approximately 25% in Europe, 6% in the Western Hemisphere, excluding the U.S., and 19% in the Asia-Pacific and Africa region. Changes in non-U.S. currencies relative to the U.S. dollar impact the Company’s revenues and expenses. While the Company uses financial instruments to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on its cash flows, unhedged exposures continue to be subject to currency fluctuations. In addition, the weakening or strengthening of the U.S. dollar may result in significant favorable or unfavorable translation effects when the operating results of the Company’s non-U.S. business activity are translated into U.S. dollars. Inflation and Currency Devaluation Risks : The Company faces challenges in maintaining profitability of operations in economies experiencing high inflation rates. The Company has accounted for operations in Argentina and Venezuela as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. While the Company strives to maintain profit margins in these areas through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price increases, it might experience operating losses as a result of continued inflation. In addition, the impact of currency devaluations in countries experiencing high inflation rates or significant currency exchange fluctuations could negatively impact the Company’s operating results. Illegal Importation of Pharmaceutical Products : The illegal importation of pharmaceutical products from countries where government price controls or other market dynamics result in lower prices may adversely affect the Company’s sales and profitability in the U.S. and other countries in which the Company operates. With the exception of limited quantities of prescription drugs for personal use, foreign imports of pharmaceutical products are illegal under current U.S. law. However, the volume of illegal imports continues to rise as the ability of patients and other customers to obtain the lower-priced imports has grown significantly. Anti-Bribery and Other Regulations: The Company is subject to various federal and foreign laws that govern its international business practices with respect to payments to government officials. Those laws include the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which prohibits U.S. publicly traded companies from promising, offering, or giving anything of value to foreign officials with the corrupt intent of influencing the foreign official for the purpose of helping the Company obtain or retain business or gain any improper advantage. The Company’s business is heavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with foreign officials. Also, in many countries outside the U.S., the healthcare providers who prescribe human pharmaceuticals are employed by the government and the purchasers of human pharmaceuticals are government entities; 12 therefore, the Company’s interactions with these prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the FCPA. In addition to the U.S. application and enforcement of the FCPA, various jurisdictions in which the Company operates have laws and regulations, including the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, aimed at preventing and penalizing corrupt and anticompetitive behavior. Enforcement activities under these laws could subject the Company to additional administrative and legal proceedings and actions, which could include claims for civil penalties, criminal sanctions, and administrative remedies, including exclusion from healthcare programs. Other Financial, Economic, Legal, Social and Political Risks . Other risks inherent in conducting business globally include: • local and regional economic environments and policies in the markets that we serve, including interest rates, monetary policy, inflation, economic growth, recession, commodity prices, and currency controls or other limitations on the ability to expatriate cash; • protective economic policies taken by governments, such as trade protection measures and import/export licensing requirements; • compliance with local regulations and laws including, in some countries, regulatory requirements restricting the Company’s ability to manufacture or sell its products in the relevant market; • diminished protection of intellectual property and contractual rights in certain jurisdictions; • potential nationalization or expropriation of the Company’s foreign assets; • political or social upheavals, economic instability, repression, or human rights issues; and • geopolitical events, including natural disasters, disruptions to markets due to war, armed conflict, terrorism, epidemics or pandemics. Failure to maintain a satisfactory credit rating could adversely affect our liquidity, capital position, borrowing costs and access to capital markets. We currently maintain investment grade credit ratings with Moody’s Investors Service and Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services. Rating agencies routinely evaluate us, and their ratings of our long-term and short-term debt are based on a number of factors. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency, whether as a result of our actions or factors which are beyond our control, can increase the cost of borrowing under any indebtedness we may incur, reduce market capacity for our commercial paper or require the posting of additional collateral under our derivative contracts. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our credit ratings, and any additional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade, may have a negative impact on our liquidity, capital position and access to capital markets. Risks Related to the Planned Separation of our Consumer Health Business The planned separation of the Company’s Consumer Health business may not be completed on the terms or timeline currently contemplated, if at all, and may not achieve the expected results. In November 2021, the Company announced its intention to separate the Company’s Consumer Health business, with the intention to create a new, publicly traded company. The planned separation is intended to qualify as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Company is targeting completion of the planned separation in 18 to 24 months after initial announcement. Completion of the planned separation will be subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including, among others, consultations with works councils and other employee representative bodies, as required, final approval of the Company’s Board of Directors, receipt of a favorable opinion and Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) ruling with respect to the tax-free nature of the transaction, and the receipt of other regulatory approvals. There can be no assurance regarding the ultimate timing of the planned separation or that such separation will be completed. Unanticipated developments could delay, prevent or otherwise adversely affect the planned separation, including but not limited to disruptions in general or financial market conditions or potential problems or delays in obtaining various regulatory and tax approvals or clearances. The costs to complete the planned separation will be significant. In addition, the Company may be unable to achieve some or all of the strategic and financial benefits that it expects to achieve from the planned separation of the Company’s Consumer Health business. The Company will incur significant expenses in connection with the planned separation. In addition, the Company may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits that are expected to result from the planned separation. The anticipated benefits of the planned separation are based on a number of assumptions, some of which may prove incorrect. 13 Following the planned separation, the price of shares of the Company’s common stock may fluctuate significantly. The Company cannot predict the effect of the planned separation on the trading price of shares of its common stock, and the market value of shares of its common stock may be less than, equal to or greater than the market value of shares of its common stock prior to the planned separation. In addition, the price of the Company’s common stock may be more volatile around the time of the planned separation. The planned separation could result in substantial tax liability. The Company intends to obtain an opinion from its U.S. tax advisors and a ruling from the IRS as to the tax-free nature of the planned separation under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The opinion and ruling will be based on, among other things, various factual assumptions and representations that the Company and the New Consumer Health Company will make regarding the past and future conduct of the companies’ respective businesses and other matters. If any of these assumptions or representations are, or become, inaccurate or incomplete, reliance on the opinion and ruling may be jeopardized. If subsequent to the planned separation it is determined that the transaction does not qualify for tax-free treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the resulting tax liability to the Company and its shareholders could be substantial. The planned separation may also not qualify for tax-free treatment in other countries around the world, and as a result may trigger substantial tax liability to the Company. Other Risks Our business depends on our ability to recruit and retain talented, highly skilled employees and a diverse workforce. Our continued growth requires us to recruit and retain talented employees representing diverse backgrounds, experiences, and skill sets. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive and our ability to compete depends on our ability to hire, develop and motivate highly skilled personnel in all areas of our organization. Maintaining our brand and reputation, as well as a diverse, equitable and inclusive work environment enables us to attract top talent. If we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain highly skilled workers and key leaders, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected. In addition, effective succession planning is important to our long-term success. Any unsuccessful implementation of our succession plans or failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Climate change or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change may negatively affect our business and results of operations. Climate change resulting from increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could present risks to our operations, including an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. Natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, such as a hurricane, tornado, earthquake, wildfire or flooding, may pose physical risks to our facilities and disrupt the operation of our supply chain. The impacts of the changing climate on water resources may result in water scarcity, limiting our ability to access sufficient high-quality water in certain locations, which may increase operational costs. Concern over climate change may also result in new or additional legal or regulatory requirements designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and/or mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment. If such laws or regulations are more stringent than current legal or regulatory obligations, we may experience disruption in, or an increase in the costs associated with sourcing, manufacturing and distribution of our products, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. Further, the impacts of climate change have an influence on customer preferences, and failure to provide climate-friendly products could potentially result in loss of market share. An information security incident, including a cybersecurity breach, could have a negative impact to the Company’s business or reputation. To meet business objectives, the Company relies on both internal information technology (IT) systems and networks, and those of third parties and their vendors, to process and store sensitive data, including confidential research, business plans, financial information, intellectual property, and personal data that may be subject to legal protection, and ensure the continuity of the Company’s supply chain. The extensive information security and cybersecurity threats, which affect companies globally, pose a risk to the security and availability of these systems and networks, and the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the Company’s sensitive data. The Company continually assesses these threats and makes investments to increase internal protection, detection, and response capabilities, as well as ensure the Company’s third-party providers have required capabilities and controls, to address this risk . To date, the Company has not experienced any material impact to the business or operations resulting from information or cybersecurity attacks; however, because of the frequently changing attack techniques, along with the increased volume and sophistication of the attacks, there is the potential for the Company to be adversely 14 impacted. This impact could result in reputational, competitive, operational or other business harm as well as financial costs and regulatory action. The Company maintains cybersecurity insurance in the event of an information security or cyber incident; however, the coverage may not be sufficient to cover all financial, legal, business or reputational losses. A breach of privacy laws or unauthorized access, loss or misuse of personal data could have a negative impact to the Company’s business or reputation. The Company is subject to privacy and data protection laws across the globe that impose broad compliance obligations on the collection, use, storage, access, transfer and protection of personal data. Breach of such requirements could result in substantial fines, penalties, private right of actions, claims and damage to our reputation and business. New privacy laws are expected in other territories, together with greater privacy enforcement by governmental authorities globally, particularly on data localization requirements and international data flows. The Company has established privacy compliance programs and controls that our businesses worldwide are required to comply with, but with many technology and data-driven initiatives being prioritized across the Company and involving multiple vendors and third parties, there are potential risks of controls imposed on cross border data flows, unauthorized access, and loss of personal data through internal and external threats that could impact our business operations and research activities.

McNEIL-PPC, Inc. (now Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc.) (McNEIL-PPC) operated under a consent decree, signed in 2011 with the U.S. FDA, which governed certain McNeil Consumer Healthcare manufacturing operations, and required McNEIL-PPC to remediate the facilities it operates in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, Fort Washington, Pennsylvania, and Las Piedras, Puerto Rico (the “Consent Decree”). Following U.S. FDA inspections McNEIL-PPC received notifications from the U.S FDA that all three manufacturing facilities were in conformity with applicable laws and regulations, and commercial production restarted in 2015. Under the Consent Decree, after receiving notice from the U.S. FDA of being in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, each of the three facilities was subject to a five-year audit period by a third-party cGMP expert.

Item 6. Reserved 20 Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION Organization and Business Segments Description of the Company and Business Segments Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 141,700 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the healthcare field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world with the primary focus on products related to human health and well-being. The Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer Health, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. The Consumer Health segment includes a broad range of products used in the Baby Care, Oral Care, Skin Health/Beauty, Over-the-Counter pharmaceutical, Women’s Health and Wound Care markets. These products are marketed to the general public and sold online (eCommerce) and to retail outlets and distributors throughout the world. The Pharmaceutical segment is focused on six therapeutic areas, including Immunology, Infectious diseases, Neuroscience, Oncology, Pulmonary Hypertension, and Cardiovascular and Metabolic diseases. Products in this segment are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers, distributors, hospitals and healthcare professionals for prescription use. The Medical Devices segment includes a broad range of products used in the Orthopaedic, Surgery, Interventional Solutions (cardiovascular and neurovascular) and Vision fields. These products are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics. The Executive Committee of Johnson & Johnson is the principal management group responsible for the strategic operations and allocation of the resources of the Company. This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities of the Consumer Health, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices business segments. In all of its product lines, the Company competes with other companies both locally and globally, throughout the world. Competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved. Competition in research, involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. The development of new and innovative products, as well as protecting the underlying intellectual property of the Company's product portfolio, is important to the Company’s success in all areas of its business. The competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research. In addition, the development and maintenance of customer demand for the Company’s consumer products involves significant expenditures for advertising and promotion. Management’s Objectives With “Our Credo” as the foundation, the Company’s purpose is to blend heart, science and ingenuity to profoundly change the trajectory of health for humanity. The Company is committed to bringing its full breadth and depth to ensure health for people today and for future generations. United around this common ambition, the Company is poised to fulfill its purpose and successfully meet the demands of the rapidly evolving markets in which it competes. The Company is broadly based in human healthcare, and is committed to creating value by developing accessible, high quality, innovative products and services. New products introduced within the past five years accounted for approximately 25% of 2021 sales. In 2021, $14.7 billion was invested in research and development reflecting management’s commitment to create life-enhancing innovations and to create value through partnerships that will profoundly change the trajectory of health for humanity. A critical driver of the Company’s success is the diversity of its 141,700 employees worldwide. Employees are empowered and inspired to lead with the Company’s Our Credo and purpose as guides. This allows every employee to use the Company’s reach and size to advance the Company's purpose, and to also lead with agility and urgency. Leveraging the extensive resources across the enterprise enables the Company to innovate and execute with excellence. This ensures the Company can remain focused on addressing the unmet needs of society every day and invest for an enduring impact, ultimately delivering value to its patients, consumers and healthcare professionals, employees, communities and shareholders. 21 Results of Operations Analysis of Consolidated Sales For discussion on results of operations and financial condition pertaining to the fiscal years 2020 and 2019 see the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021, Item 7.

Sales by companies in the Asia-Pacific, Africa region achieved growth of 14.1% as compared to the prior year, including operational growth of 11.4% and a positive currency impact of 2.7%. The Company estimated that the inclusion of a 53rd week in the fiscal year 2020 results negatively impacted the 2021 comparative sales growth by approximately 1.0%. (See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for Annual Closing Date details). While the additional week added a few days to sales, it also added a full week's worth of operating costs; therefore, the net earnings impact was negligible. In 2021, the Company utilized three wholesalers distributing products for all three segments that represented approximately 14.0%, 11.0% and 11.0% of the total consolidated revenues. In 2020, the Company had three wholesalers distributing products for all three segments that represented approximately 16.0%, 12.0% and 12.0% of the total consolidated revenues. Note: values may have been rounded 22 Analysis of Sales by Business Segments Consumer Health Segment Consumer Health segment sales in 2021 were $14.6 billion, an increase of 4.1% from 2020, which included 2.8% operational growth and a positive currency impact of 1.3%. U.S. Consumer Health segment sales were $6.5 billion, an increase of 2.4%. International sales were $8.1 billion, an increase of 5.6%, which included 3.1% operational growth and a positive currency impact of 2.5%. In 2021, acquisitions and divestitures had a net negative impact of 1.0% on the operational sales growth of the worldwide Consumer Health segment. Major Consumer Health Franchise Sales: % Change (Dollars in Millions) 2021 2020 ’21 vs. ’20 OTC $ 5,227 4,824 8.4 % Skin Health/Beauty 4,541 4,450 2.0 Oral Care 1,645 1,641 0.2 Baby Care 1,566 1,517 3.2 Women’s Health 917 901 1.8 Wound Care/Other 739 720 2.6 Total Consumer Health Sales $ 14,635 14,053 4.1 % The OTC franchise sales of $5.2 billion increased 8.4% as compared to the prior year. Growth was primarily attributable to Analgesics, TYLENOL ® and MOTRIN ® , digestive health and the hydration benefit offering (ORSL). The Skin Health/Beauty franchise sales of $4.5 billion increased 2.0% as compared to the prior year. Growth was primarily due to COVID-19 recovery, strong performance of NEUTROGENA ® and AVEENO ® , and eCommerce acceleration partially offset by the divestiture of DR. CI:LABO - Sedona business in Asia Pacific and external supply constraints. The Oral Care franchise sales of $1.6 billion increased 0.2% as compared to the prior year. Market growth in the U.S. along with strong performance in the Asia Pacific region due to successful brand building and promotional campaigns and the positive impact of currency offset the negative impact of the floss divestiture and U.S. external supply constraints. The Baby Care franchise sales of $1.6 billion increased 3.2% compared to the prior year. Growth was driven by AVEENO ® Asia Pacific eCommerce strength, innovation and COVID-19 recovery. The Women’s Health franchise sales of $0.9 billion increased 1.8% as compared to the prior year primarily driven by COVID-19 market recovery, favorable price and strong brand building in Asia Pacific partially offset by disruptions in Europe due to flooding. The Wound Care/Other franchise sales of $0.7 billion increased 2.6% as compared to the prior year. Growth was due to strong performance of BAND-AID ® Brand Adhesive Bandages in the U.S. partially offset by product discontinuations and competitive pressures in Asia Pacific. In November 2021, the Company announced its intention to separate the Company’s Consumer Health business, with the intention to create a new, publicly traded company. The Company is targeting completion of the planned separation in 18 to 24 months after initial announcement. 23 Pharmaceutical Segment Pharmaceutical segment sales in 2021 were $52.1 billion, an increase of 14.3% from 2020, which included operational growth of 13.1% and a positive currency impact of 1.2%. U.S. sales were $28.0 billion, an increase of 8.6%. International sales were $24.1 billion, an increase of 21.6%, which included 18.8% operational growth and a positive currency impact of 2.8%. In 2021, acquisitions and divestitures had a net negative impact of 0.5% on the operational sales growth of the worldwide Pharmaceutical segment. Adjustments to previous sales reserve estimates were approximately $0.7 billion and $0.6 billion in fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively.

This was partially offset by lower sales of REMICADE ® (infliximab) due to biosimilar competition. Biosimilar versions of REMICADE ® have been introduced in the United States and certain markets outside the United States and additional competitors continue to enter the market. Continued infliximab biosimilar competition will result in a further reduction in sales of REMICADE ® . The latest expiring United States patent for STELARA ® (ustekinumab) will expire in September 2023. STELARA ® (ustekinumab) U.S. sales in fiscal 2021 were approximately $5.9 billion. The expiration of a product patent or loss of market exclusivity is likely to result in a reduction in sales. Infectious disease products achieved sales of $5.9 billion in 2021, representing an increase of 64.0% as compared to the prior year. Growth was primarily driven by the contribution of the COVID-19 vaccine. This was partially offset by lower sales of PREZISTA ® and PREZCOBIX ® /REZOLSTA ® (darunavir/cobicistat) due to increased competition and loss of exclusivity of PREZISTA ® in certain countries outside the U.S. Neuroscience products achieved sales of $7.0 billion, representing an increase of 7.1% as compared to the prior year. Paliperidone long-acting injectables growth was driven by sales of INVEGA SUSTENNA ® /XEPLION ® (paliperidone palmitate) and INVEGA TRINZA ® /TREVICTA ® from new patient starts and persistence as well as the launch of INVEGA HAFYERA™. Oncology products achieved sales of $14.5 billion in 2021, representing an increase of 17.6% as compared to the prior year. Contributors to the growth were strong sales of DARZALEX ® (daratumumab) driven by continued strong market growth, share gains in all regions and solid uptake of the subcutaneous formulation launched in 2020; the continued global launch uptake of ERLEADA ® (apalutamide) and IMBRUVICA ® (ibrutinib) growth primarily driven by market and continued share leadership. The growth of IMBRUVICA ® (ibrutinib) was partially offset by competitive pressures from novel oral agents and COVID-19 related market dynamics including delays in new patient starts. Pulmonary Hypertension products achieved sales of $3.5 billion, representing an increase of 9.6% as compared to the prior year. Sales growth of OPSUMIT ® (macitentan) and UPTRAVI ® (selexipag) were due to continued share gains and market growth. Cardiovascular/Metabolism/Other products sales were $4.5 billion, a decline of 8.6% as compared to the prior year. The decline was primarily attributable to lower sales of INVOKANA ® /INVOKAMET ® (canagliflozin) due to share erosion and PROCRIT ® / EPREX ® (epoetin alfa) due to biosimilar competition. 25 During 2021, the Company advanced its pipeline with several regulatory submissions and approvals for new drugs and additional indications for existing drugs as follows: Product Name (Chemical Name) Indication US Approval EU Approval US Filing EU Filing BYANNLI ® Maintenance Treatment of Schizophrenia in Adults • CABENUVA (rilpivirine and cabotegravir) HIV treatment for use every two months • COVID-19 Vaccine COVID-19 Emergency Use • • COVID-19 Vaccine Booster Shot COVID-19 Emergency Use • • DARZALEX ® (daratumumab) Subcutaneous (SC) formulation Treatment for Newly Diagnosed Systemic Light Chain Amyloidosis and Gains an Additional Approval in Pre-Treated Multiple Myeloma • DARZALEX FASPRO ® (daratumumab and hyaluronidase-fihj) Combination with Carfilzomib and Dexamethasone for Patients with Multiple Myeloma After First or Subsequent Relapse • INVEGA HAFYERA (paliperidone palmitate) First and Only Twice-Yearly Treatment for Adults with Schizophrenia • PONVORY (Ponesimod) Treatment of Adults with Relapsing Forms of Multiple Sclerosis with Active Disease Defined by Clinical or Imaging Features • PONVORY (Ponesimod) Oral Treatment for Adults with Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis • RYBREVANT (amivantamab-vmjw) Treatment for Patients with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer with EGFR Exon 20 Insertion Mutations • SPRAVATO ® (esketamine) Rapid reduction of depressive symptoms in a psychiatric emergency for patients with major depressive disorder • STELARA ® (ustekinumab) Treatment of Pediatric Patients with Juvenille Psoriatic Arthritis • Teclistamab Treatment of Patients with Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma • UPTRAVI ® (selexipag) Intravenous Use in Adult Patients with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) • XARELTO ® (rivaroxaban) Help Prevent and Treat Blood Clots in Pediatric Patients • • XARELTO ® (rivaroxaban) Expanded Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) Indication to Include Patients After Lower-Extremity Revascularization (LER) • 26 Medical Devices Segment The Medical Devices segment sales in 2021 were $27.1 billion, an increase of 17.9% from 2020, which included operational growth of 16.2% and a positive currency impact of 1.7%. U.S. sales were $12.7 billion, an increase of 14.9% as compared to the prior year. International sales were $14.4 billion, an increase of 20.6% as compared to the prior year, which included operational growth of 17.3% and a positive currency impact of 3.3%. In 2021, the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures on the Medical Devices segment worldwide operational sales growth was a negative 0.6% primarily due to the divestiture of Advanced Sterilization Products (ASP). The Company has seen a market recovery in global procedural volumes in the Medical Devices segment as compared to the prior year which had significant negative impacts from COVID-19. This procedural volume recovery is the primary driver of sales and earnings growth as compared to the prior year.

The growth in Advanced Surgery was primarily driven by Endocutter, Biosurgery and Energy products attributable to market recovery, market expansion and the success of new products offsetting competitive pressures in the U.S. The growth in General Surgery was primarily driven by market recovery and the continued strength of the suture portfolio partially offset by the impact of the ASP divestiture in the prior year. The Orthopaedics franchise achieved sales of $8.6 billion in 2021, representing an increase of 10.6% from 2020. The growth in hips reflects the market recovery combined with continued strength of the portfolio including the ACTIS ® stem and enabling technologies – KINCISE™ and VELYS™ Hip Navigation. The growth in knees was primarily driven by procedure recovery and new product introductions. The growth in Trauma was driven by global market recovery and uptake of new products. The growth in Spine, Sports & Other was primarily driven by procedure recovery and new product introductions. The Vision franchise achieved sales of $4.7 billion in 2021, representing an increase of 19.6% from 2020. The Contact Lenses/Other operational growth was due to market recovery and market share gains from new products. Surgical Vision operational growth was primarily due to market recovery and uptake of recently launched products. The Interventional Solutions franchise achieved sales of $4.0 billion in 2021, an increase of 30.4% from 2020. Growth in the electrophysiology and stroke businesses were driven by market recovery and success of new products and commercial strategies. Beginning in the fiscal first quarter of 2022, the Medical Devices segment will be referred to as the MedTech segment. 27 Analysis of Consolidated Earnings Before Provision for Taxes on Income Consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income was $22.8 billion and $16.5 billion for the years 2021 and 2020, respectively. As a percent to sales, consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income was 24.3% and 20.0%, in 2021 and 2020, respectively. (Dollars in billions. Percentages in chart are as a percent to total sales) Cost of Products Sold and Selling, Marketing and Administrative Expenses: (Dollars in billions. Percentages in chart are as a percent to total sales) Cost of products sold decreased as a percent to sales driven by: • Non-recurring prior year COVID-19 production related slow-downs and related inventory impacts • Fixed cost deleveraging in the Medical Devices business in the fiscal 2020 • Favorable mix within the Pharmaceutical business as well as at the enterprise level with a higher percentage of sales coming from the Pharmaceutical business • Supply chain efficiencies in the Consumer Health segment The intangible asset amortization expense included in cost of products sold was $4.7 billion for both fiscal years 2021 and 2020. 28 Selling, Marketing and Administrative Expenses decreased as a percent to sales driven by: • Leveraging in the Medical Devices business resulting from the recovery of sales from the prior years impact of COVID-19 Partially offset by: • Increased brand marketing expenses in the Consumer Health business Research and Development Expense: Research and development expense by segment of business was as follows: 2021 2020 (Dollars in Millions) Amount % of Sales* Amount % of Sales* Consumer Health $ 455 3.1 % $ 422 3.0 % Pharmaceutical 11,882 22.8 9,563 21.0 Medical Devices 2,377 8.8 2,174 9.5 Total research and development expense $ 14,714 15.7 % $ 12,159 14.7 % Percent increase/(decrease) over the prior year 21.0 % 7.1 % *As a percent to segment sales Research and development activities represent a significant part of the Company's business. These expenditures relate to the processes of discovering, testing and developing new products, upfront payments and developmental milestones, improving existing products, as well as ensuring product efficacy and regulatory compliance prior to launch. The Company remains committed to investing in research and development with the aim of delivering high quality and innovative products. Research and Development increased as a percent to sales primarily driven by: • General portfolio progression in the Pharmaceutical business • COVID-19 vaccine expenses, net of governmental reimbursements In-Process Research and Development (IPR&D): In fiscal year 2021, the Company recorded a partial IPR&D charge of $0.9 billion primarily related to expected development delays in the general surgery digital robotics platform (Ottava) acquired with the Auris Health acquisition in 2019. The impairment charge was calculated based on revisions to the discounted cash flow valuation model reflecting a delay of first in human procedures of approximately two years from the initial acquisition model assumption of the second half of 2022. The Company will continue to monitor the remaining $1.5 billion Ottava platform intangible asset as development program activities are ongoing. In fiscal year 2020, the Company recorded an IPR&D charge of $0.2 billion primarily related to a partial impairment due to timing and progression of one of the digital surgery platforms acquired with the Auris Health acquisition. On January 28, 2022, subsequent to the fiscal year 2021, additional information regarding efficacy became available which led the Company to the decision to terminate the development of bermekimab for Atopic Dermatitis (AD). The Company recorded an intangible asset impairment charge of approximately $0.6 billion related to an in-process research and development asset, bermekimab (JnJ-77474462), an investigational drug for the treatment of AD and Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS). The impairment charge is related to the AD indication and is a nonrecognized subsequent event and will be reflected in the first quarter 2022 financial statements. The Company acquired all rights to bermekimab from XBiotech, Inc. in fiscal year 2020. Other (Income) Expense, Net: Other (income) expense, net is the account where the Company records gains and losses related to the sale and write-down of certain investments in equity securities held by Johnson & Johnson Innovation - JJDC, Inc. (JJDC), unrealized gains and losses on investments, income and losses associated with certain employee benefit programs, gains and losses on divestitures, certain transactional currency gains and losses, acquisition-related costs, litigation accruals and settlements, as well as royalty income. 29 Other (income) expense, net for the fiscal year 2021 was favorable by $2.4 billion as compared to the prior year primarily due to the following: (Dollars in Billions)(Income)/Expense 2021 2020 Change Litigation expense (1) $ 2.3 5.1 (2.8) Acquisition, Integration and Divestiture related (2) (0.5) (1.1) 0.6 (Gains)/losses on securities (0.5) (0.5) 0.0 Restructuring related 0.1 0.1 0.0 Employee benefit plan related (0.6) (0.4) (0.2) Other (3) (0.3) (0.3) — Total Other (Income) Expense, Net $ 0.5 2.9 (2.4) ( 1) 2021 is primarily related to talc and Risperdal. 2020 is primarily related to talc and the opioid litigation settlement. (2) 2021 is p rimarily related to divestiture gains of two pharmaceutical brands outside the U.S. 2020 is primarily driven by a contingent consideration reversal of approximately $1.1 billion related to the timing of certain developmental milestones associated with the Auris Health acquisition. (3 ) 2021 includes Consumer Health separation costs of $0.1 billion. Costs in future years are expected to be significantly higher. Interest (Income) Expense: The fiscal year 2021 included net interest expense of $130 million as compared to $90 million net interest expense in the fiscal year 2020. This was primarily due to lower rates of interest earned on cash balances and a higher average debt balance, partially offset by the benefit from net investment hedging. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $31.6 billion at the end of 2021, and averaged $28.4 billion as compared to the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities total of $25.2 billion and $22.2 billion average cash balance in 2020. The total debt balance at the end of 2021 was $33.8 billion with an average debt balance of $34.5 billion as compared to $35.3 billion at the end of 2020 and an average debt balance of $31.5 billion. Income Before Tax by Segment Income (loss) before tax by segment of business were as follows: Income Before Tax Segment Sales Percent of Segment Sales (Dollars in Millions) 2021 2020 2021 2020 2021 2020 Consumer Health $ 1,294 (1,064) 14,635 14,053 8.8 % (7.6) Pharmaceutical 18,181 15,462 52,080 45,572 34.9 33.9 Medical Devices 4,373 3,044 27,060 22,959 16.2 13.3 Total (1) 23,848 17,442 93,775 82,584 25.4 21.1 Less: Net expense not allocated to segments (2) 1,072 945 Earnings before provision for taxes on income $ 22,776 16,497 93,775 82,584 24.3 % 20.0 (1) See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details. (2) Amounts not allocated to segments include interest (income) expense and general corporate (income) expense. Consumer Health Segment: In 2021, the Consumer Health segment income before tax as a percent of sales was 8.8% versus a loss before tax of 7.6% in 2020. The increase in the income before tax as a percent of sales was primarily driven by the following: • 2021 litigation expense includes $1.6 billion of talc expenses; 2020 includes $3.9 billion of talc expenses • Supply chain efficiencies partially offset by: • Increased brand marketing expenses and commodity inflation Pharmaceutical Segment: In 2021, the Pharmaceutical segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 34.9% versus 33.9% in 2020. The increase in the income before tax as a percent of sales was primarily driven by the following: • Divestiture gains of $0.6 billion related to two pharmaceutical brands outside the U.S. in fiscal 2021 • 2021 litigation expense includes $0.6 billion primarily related to Risperdal; 2020 includes $0.8 billion primarily related to the opioid litigation settlement partially offset by: • Research & Development investment in the COVID-19 vaccine net of governmental reimbursements and general portfolio progression 30 Medical Devices Segment: In 2021, the Medical Devices segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 16.2% versus 13.3% in 2020. The increase in the income before tax as a percent to sales was primarily driven by the following: • Recovery of prior year COVID-19 production related slow downs and related inventory impacts • Overall expense leveraging resulting from the Medical Devices sales recovery • Litigation expense of $0.1 billion in 2021 vs. $0.3 billion in 2020 partially offset by: • A contingent consideration reversal of approximately $1.1 billion in the fiscal 2020 related to the timing of certain developmental milestones associated with the Auris Health acquisition • A higher IPR&D charge of $0.7 billion ($0.9 billion in 2021 related to the general surgery offering in digital robotics (Ottava) acquired with the Auris Health acquisition in 2019) Restructuring: In the fiscal second quarter of 2018, the Company announced plans to implement actions across its Global Supply Chain that are intended to enable the Company to focus resources and increase investments in critical capabilities, technologies and solutions necessary to manufacture and supply its product portfolio of the future, enhance agility and drive growth. The Company expects these supply chain actions will include expanding its use of strategic collaborations, and bolstering its initiatives to reduce complexity, improving cost-competitiveness, enhancing capabilities and optimizing its network. Discussions regarding specific future actions are ongoing and are subject to all relevant consultation requirements before they are finalized. In total, the Company expects these actions to generate approximately $0.6 to $0.8 billion in annual pre-tax cost savings that will be substantially delivered by the end of 2022. The Company expects to record pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $2.1 to $2.3 billion. The Company estimates that approximately 70% of the cumulative pre-tax costs will result in cash outlays. In 2021, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $0.5 billion, which is included on the following lines of the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, $0.3 billion in restructuring, $0.1 billion in other (income) expense and $0.1 billion in cost of products sold. Total project costs of approximately $1.8 billion have been recorded since the restructuring was announced. The program is set to be completed at the end of 2022. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the restructuring programs. Provision for Taxes on Income: The worldwide effective income tax rate was 8.3% in 2021 and 10.8% in 2020. For discussion related to the fiscal 2021 provision for taxes refer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity & Cash Flows Cash and cash equivalents were $14.5 billion at the end of 2021 as compared to $14.0 billion at the end of 2020. The primary sources and uses of cash that contributed to the $0.5 billion increase were: (Dollars In Billions) $ 14.0 Q4 2020 Cash and cash equivalents balance 23.4 cash generated from operating activities (8.7) net cash used by investing activities (14.0) net cash used by financing activities (0.2) effect of exchange rate and rounding $ 14.5 Q4 2021 Cash and cash equivalents balance In addition, the Company had $17.1 billion in marketable securities at the end of fiscal year 2021 and $11.2 billion at the end of fiscal year 2020. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. 31 Cash flow from operations of $23.4 billion was the result of: (Dollars In Billions) $ 20.9 Net Earnings 6.8 non-cash expenses and other adjustments primarily for depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation and asset write-downs partially offset by the deferred tax provision, net gain on sale of assets/businesses and credit losses and accounts receivable allowances (1.1) a decrease in current and non-current liabilities 2.4 an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities (5.6) an increase in accounts receivable, inventories and other current and non-current assets $ 23.4 Cash Flow from operations Investing activities use of $8.7 billion of cash was primarily used for: (Dollars In Billions) $ (3.7) additions to property, plant and equipment (5.4) net purchases of investments 0.7 proceeds from the disposal of assets/businesses, net 0.2 Credit support agreements activity, net (0.1) acquisitions (0.4) other (primarily licenses and milestones) and rounding $ (8.7) Net cash used for investing activities Financing activities use of $14.0 billion of cash was primarily used for: (Dollars In Billions) $ (11.0) dividends to shareholders (3.5) repurchase of common stock for employee share programs (1.0) net repayment from short and long term debt 1.0 proceeds from stock options exercised/employee withholding tax on stock awards, net 0.3 Credit support agreements activity, net 0.2 other and rounding $ (14.0) Net cash used for financing activities As of January 2, 2022, the Company's notes payable and long-term debt was in excess of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. As of January 2, 2022, the net debt position was $2.1 billion as compared to the prior year of $10.1 billion. There was a decrease in the net debt position due to repayment of debt and an increase in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities generating from operations. The debt balance at the end of 2021 was $33.8 billion as compared to $35.3 billion in 2020. Considering recent market conditions and the on-going COVID-19 crisis, the Company has evaluated its operating cash flows and liquidity profile and does not foresee any significant incremental risk. The Company anticipates that operating cash flows, the ability to raise funds from external sources, borrowing capacity from existing committed credit facilities and access to the commercial paper markets will continue to provide sufficient resources to fund operating needs, including the Company's approximate $1.1 billion in contractual supply commitments associated with its development of the COVID-19 vaccine, the opioid litigation settlement for $5.0 billion and the establishment of the $2.0 billion trust for talc related liabilities (See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details). In addition, the Company monitors the global capital markets on an ongoing basis and from time to time may raise capital when market conditions are favorable. Effective beginning in fiscal 2022, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Job Act of 2017 currently requires the Company to deduct U.S. and international research and development expenditures for tax purposes over 5 to 15 years, instead of in the current fiscal year. As a result, the Company is expecting an increase in annual cash tax payments to the U.S Treasury of an incremental $1.0 to 1.5 billion beginning in fiscal 2022. The Company will concurrently record a deferred tax benefit for the future amortization of the research and development (R&D) for tax purposes and therefore, the Company is not expecting a significant impact to its effective tax rate related to this change. The requirement to expense R&D as incurred is unchanged for U.S. GAAP purposes and the impact to pre-tax R&D expense is not affected by this provision. Additionally, as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), the Company has access to its cash outside the U.S. at a significantly reduced cost. During the fiscal third quarter of 32 2021, in accordance with the terms of the agreement associated with the acquisition of Actelion, the Company's undrawn credit facility with Idorsia was terminated. The following table summarizes the Company’s material contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as of January 2, 2022: To satisfy these obligations, the Company intends to use cash from operations. (Dollars in Millions) Tax Legislation (TCJA) Debt Obligations Interest on Debt Obligations Total 2022 $ 812 2,131 909 3,852 2023 1,522 1,551 893 3,966 2024 2,029 1,518 843 4,390 2025 2,536 1,732 789 5,057 2026 — 1,995 744 2,739 After 2026 — 23,189 8,786 31,975 Total $ 6,899 32,116 12,964 51,979 For tax matters, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The table does not include activity related to business combinations or the Company’s approximate $1.1 billion in contractual supply commitments associated with its development of a COVID-19 vaccine. Financing and Market Risk The Company uses financial instruments to manage the impact of foreign exchange rate changes on cash flows. Accordingly, the Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to protect the value of certain foreign currency assets and liabilities and to hedge future foreign currency transactions primarily related to product costs. Gains or losses on these contracts are offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions. A 10% appreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the January 2, 2022 market rates would increase the unrealized value of the Company’s forward contracts by $0.1 billion. Conversely, a 10% depreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the January 2, 2022 market rates would decrease the unrealized value of the Company’s forward contracts by $0.1 billion. In either scenario, the gain or loss on the forward contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated earnings and cash flows. The Company hedges the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and the effect on certain assets and liabilities in foreign currency, by entering into currency swap contracts. A 1% change in the spread between U.S. and foreign interest rates on the Company’s interest rate sensitive financial instruments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of the Company’s swap contracts by approximately $2.2 billion. In either scenario, at maturity, the gain or loss on the swap contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated cash flows. The Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Further, the Company has a policy of only entering into contracts with parties that have at least an investment grade credit rating. The counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions and there is no significant concentration of exposure with any one counterparty. Management believes the risk of loss is remote. The Company entered into credit support agreements (CSA) with certain derivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on respective credit ratings and netting agreements. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on credit support agreements. The Company invests in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities which carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. A 1% (100 basis points) change in spread on the Company’s interest rate sensitive investments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of cash equivalents and current marketable securities by approximately $0.1 billion. The Company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous banks worldwide. In September 2021, the Company secured a new 364-day Credit Facility. Total credit available to the Company approximates $10 billion, which expires on September 8, 2022. Interest charged on borrowings under the credit line agreement is based on either Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) Reference Rate or other applicable market rate as allowed plus applicable margins. Commitment fees under the agreement are not material. Total borrowings at the end of 2021 and 2020 were $33.8 billion and $35.3 billion, respectively. The decrease in borrowings was due to the repayment of debt. In 2021, net debt (cash and current marketable securities, net of debt) was $2.1 billion compared to net debt of $10.1 billion in 2020. Total debt represented 31.3% of total capital (shareholders’ equity and total debt) in 2021 and 35.8% of total capital in 2020. Shareholders’ equity per share at the end of 2021 was $28.16 compared to $24.04 at year-end 2020. A summary of borrowings can be found in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 33 Dividends The Company increased its dividend in 2021 for the 59th consecutive year. Cash dividends paid were $4.19 per share in 2021 and $3.98 per share in 2020. On January 4, 2022, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $1.06 per share, payable on March 8, 2022 to shareholders of record as of February 22, 2022. Other Information Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are based on the Company’s consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and other related disclosures. Actual results may or may not differ from these estimates. The Company believes that the understanding of certain key accounting policies and estimates are essential in achieving more insight into the Company’s operating results and financial condition. These key accounting policies include revenue recognition, income taxes, legal and self-insurance contingencies, valuation of long-lived assets, assumptions used to determine the amounts recorded for pensions and other employee benefit plans and accounting for stock based awards. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts the Company’s business and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors including, but not limited to, the magnitude and duration of COVID-19, the extent to which it will impact worldwide macroeconomic conditions including interest rates, employment rates and health insurance coverage, the speed of the anticipated recovery, and governmental and business reactions to the pandemic. The Company assessed certain accounting matters that generally require consideration of forecasted financial information in context with the information reasonably available to the Company and the unknown future impacts of COVID-19 as of January 2, 2022 and through the date of this report. The accounting matters assessed included, but were not limited to, the Company’s allowance for doubtful accounts and credit losses, inventory and related reserves, accrued rebates and associated reserves, and the carrying value of the goodwill and other long-lived assets. While there was not a material impact to the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended January 2, 2022, the Company’s future assessment of the magnitude and duration of COVID-19, as well as other factors, could result in material impacts to the Company’s consolidated financial statements in future reporting periods. Revenue Recognition: The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the goods to customers. The Company's global payment terms are typically between 30 to 90 days. Provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns, discounts to customers and governmental clawback provisions are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales. Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants, as well as market conditions, including consideration of competitor pricing. Rebates are estimated based on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served. The Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through the analysis of wholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally generated information. Sales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals. Sales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in the field, or in specific areas, product recall. The sales returns reserve is based on historical return trends by product and by market as a percent to gross sales. In accordance with the Company’s accounting policies, the Company generally issues credit to customers for returned goods. The Company’s sales returns reserves are accounted for in accordance with the U.S. GAAP guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns reserves are recorded at full sales value. Sales returns in the Consumer Health and Pharmaceutical segments are almost exclusively not resalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the Medical Devices segment are typically resalable but are not material. The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products. The sales returns reserve for the total Company has been approximately 1.0% of annual net trade sales during the fiscal years 2021 and 2020. Promotional programs, such as product listing allowances and cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in the same period as related sales. Continuing promotional programs include coupons and volume-based sales incentive programs. The redemption cost of consumer coupons is based on historical redemption experience by product and value. Volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales volumes for the incentive period and are recorded as products are sold. These arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred or recorded as a reduction of revenue. The Company also earns profit-share payments through collaborative arrangements of certain products, which are included in 34 sales to customers. For all years presented, profit-share payments were less than 3.0% of the total revenues and are included in sales to customers. In addition, the Company enters into collaboration arrangements that contain multiple revenue generating activities. Amounts due from collaborative partners for these arrangements are recognized as each activity is performed or delivered, based on the relative selling price. Upfront fees received as part of these arrangements are deferred and recognized over the performance period. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures on collaborations. Reasonably likely changes to assumptions used to calculate the accruals for rebates, returns and promotions are not anticipated to have a material effect on the financial statements. The Company currently discloses the impact of changes to assumptions in the quarterly or annual filing in which there is a material financial statement impact. Below are tables that show the progression of accrued rebates, returns, promotions, reserve for doubtful accounts and reserve for cash discounts by segment of business for the fiscal years ended January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021.

The Company estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on enacted tax regulations and rates. Future changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company follows U.S. GAAP, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Management believes that changes in these estimates would not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial position. The Company has recorded deferred tax liabilities on all undistributed earnings prior to December 31, 2017 from its international subsidiaries. The Company has not provided deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings subsequent to January 1, 2018 from certain international subsidiaries where the earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. The Company intends to continue to reinvest these earnings in those international operations. If the Company decides at a later date to repatriate these earnings to the U.S., the Company would be required to provide for the net tax effects on these amounts. The Company estimates that the tax effect of this repatriation would be approximately $0.7 billion under currently enacted tax laws and regulations and at current currency exchange rates. This amount does not include the possible benefit of U.S. foreign tax credits, which may substantially offset this cost. See Note 1 and Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding income taxes. Legal and Self Insurance Contingencies: The Company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal proceedings and product liability claims as these arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on management’s judgment as to the probability of losses and, where applicable, actuarially determined estimates. The Company has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals in the self insurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated. The Company follows the provisions of U.S. GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies. A liability is recorded when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. See Notes 1 and 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding product liability and legal proceedings. Long-Lived and Intangible Assets: The Company assesses changes, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows in evaluating the value of the Company’s property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets. As these assumptions and estimates may change over time, it may or may not be necessary for the Company to record impairment charges. Employee Benefit Plans: The Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit, defined contribution and termination indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide. These plans are based on assumptions for the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, expected salary increases, healthcare cost trend rates and attrition rates. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on these rates. Stock Based Compensation: The Company recognizes compensation expense associated with the issuance of equity instruments to employees for their services. Based on the type of equity instrument, the fair value is estimated on the date of grant using either the Black-Scholes option valuation model or a combination of both the Black-Scholes option valuation model and Monte Carlo valuation model, and is expensed in the financial statements over the service period. The input assumptions used in determining fair value are the expected life, expected volatility, risk-free rate and expected dividend yield. Prior to fiscal 2020, for performance share units, the fair market value was calculated for each of the three component goals at the date of grant: operational sales, adjusted operational earnings per share and relative total shareholder return. Beginning in fiscal 2020, for performance share units, the fair market value is calculated for the two component goals at the date of grant: adjusted operational earnings per share and relative total shareholder return. The fair values for the earnings per share goal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the fair market value of the shares at the time of the award, discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the performance share units during the vesting period. The fair value for the relative total shareholder return goal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo valuation model. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. New Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of January 2, 2022. 37 Economic and Market Factors COVID-19 considerations and business continuity The Company has considered various internal and external factors in assessing the potential impact of COVID-19 on its business and financial results based upon information available at this time, as follows: • Operating Model: The Company has a diversified business model across the healthcare industry with flexibility designed into its manufacturing, research and development clinical operations and commercial capabilities. • Supply Chain: The Company continues to leverage its global manufacturing footprint and dual-source capabilities while closely monitoring and maintaining critical inventory at major distribution centers away from high-risk areas to help ensure adequate and effective distribution. • Business Continuity: The robust, active business continuity plans across the Company's network have been instrumental in preparing the Company for events like COVID-19 and the ability to meet the majority of patient and consumer needs remains uninterrupted. • Workforce: The Company has put procedures in place to protect its essential workforce in manufacturing, distribution, commercial and research operations while ensuring appropriate remote working protocols have been established for other employees. • Liquidity: The Company's high-quality credit rating allows the Company superior access to the financial capital markets for the foreseeable future. • Domestic and Foreign Legislation: The Company will continue to assess and evaluate the on-going global legislative efforts to combat the COVID-19 impact on economies and the sectors in which it participates. Currently, the recent legislative acts put in place are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s operations. In fiscal 2020 and 2021, the Company entered into a series of contract manufacturing arrangements for vaccine production with third party contract manufacturing organizations. These arrangements provide the Company with future supplemental commercial capacity for vaccine production and potentially transferable rights to such production if capacity is not required. Amounts paid for services to be delivered and contractually obligated to be paid to these contract manufacturing organizations of approximately $1.1 billion are reflected in the prepaid expenses and other, other assets, accrued liabilities and other liabilities accounts in the Company's consolidated balance sheet upon execution of each agreement. Additionally, the Company has entered into certain vaccine development cost sharing arrangements with government related organizations. The Company continues to evaluate and monitor both its internal and external supply arrangements, including its contract with Emergent BioSolutions and related production activities at its Bayview, Maryland facility. The Company has established a global vaccine supply network, where, in addition to its internal manufacturing site in Leiden, the Netherlands, ten other manufacturing sites will be involved in the production of vaccine across different countries and continents. The Company does not believe that a disruption at a vaccine manufacturing site, or the resulting delay would have a material financial impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements or results. The Company is aware that its products are used in an environment where, for more than a decade, policymakers, consumers and businesses have expressed concerns about the rising cost of healthcare. In response to these concerns, the Company has a long-standing policy of pricing products responsibly. For the period 2011 - 2021, in the U.S., the weighted average compound annual growth rate of the Company’s net price increases for healthcare products (prescription and over-the-counter drugs, hospital and professional products) was below the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI). The Company operates in certain countries where the economic conditions continue to present significant challenges. The Company continues to monitor these situations and take appropriate actions. Inflation rates continue to have an effect on worldwide economies and, consequently, on the way companies operate. The Company has accounted for operations in Argentina and Venezuela as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. This did not have a material impact to the Company's results in the period. In the face of increasing costs, the Company strives to maintain its profit margins through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price increases. The Company is exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. A 1% change in the value of the U.S. Dollar as compared to all foreign currencies in which the Company had sales, income or expense in 2021 would have increased or decreased the translation of foreign sales by approximately $0.5 billion and net income by approximately $0.2 billion. Governments around the world consider various proposals to make changes to tax laws, which may include increasing or decreasing existing statutory tax rates. In connection with various government initiatives, companies are required to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in other countries. A change in statutory tax rate in any country would result in the revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the period in which the new tax law is enacted. This change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The Company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the countries where it operates. Changes to the statutory tax rate may occur at any time, and any related expense or benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted. The Company faces various worldwide healthcare changes that may continue to result in pricing pressures that include healthcare cost containment and government legislation relating to sales, promotions and reimbursement of healthcare products. 38 Changes in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of healthcare products and services, including delaying medical procedures, rationing prescription medications, reducing the frequency of physician visits and foregoing healthcare insurance coverage, as a result of the current global economic downturn, may continue to impact the Company’s businesses. The Company also operates in an environment increasingly hostile to intellectual property rights. Firms have filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications or Biosimilar Biological Product Applications with the U.S. FDA or otherwise challenged the coverage and/or validity of the Company's patents, seeking to market generic or biosimilar forms of many of the Company’s key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. In the event the Company is not successful in defending the patent claims challenged in the resulting lawsuits, generic or biosimilar versions of the products at issue will be introduced to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for those products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. There is also a risk that one or more competitors could launch a generic or biosimilar version of the product at issue following regulatory approval even though one or more valid patents are in place. Legal Proceedings Johnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial, employment, indemnification and other matters; governmental investigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. The Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of January 2, 2022, the Company has determined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal issue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance with ASC 450-20-25. For these and other litigation and regulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors including, among other things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and unpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements; complexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. To the extent adverse awards, judgments or verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated. In the Company's opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with counsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company's balance sheet, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position. However, the resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and cash flows for that period. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further information regarding legal proceedings. Common Stock The Company’s Common Stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol JNJ. As of February 10, 2022, there were 127,899 record holders of Common Stock of the Company.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company). Intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated. Columns and rows within tables may not add due to rounding. Percentages have been calculated using actual, non-rounded figures. Description of the Company and Business Segments The Company has approximately 141,700 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the healthcare field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world and its primary focus is on products related to human health and well-being. The Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer Health, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. The Consumer Health segment includes a broad range of products used in the Baby Care, Oral Care, Skin Health/Beauty, Over-the-Counter pharmaceutical, Women’s Health and Wound Care markets. These products are marketed to the general public and sold online (eCommerce) and to retail outlets and distributors throughout the world. The Pharmaceutical segment is focused on six therapeutic areas, including Immunology, Infectious diseases, Neuroscience, Oncology, Pulmonary Hypertension, and Cardiovascular and Metabolic diseases. Products in this segment are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers, distributors, hospitals and healthcare professionals for prescription use. The Medical Devices segment includes a broad range of products used in the Orthopaedic, Surgery, Interventional Solutions (cardiovascular and neurovascular) and Vision fields. These products are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics. In November 2021, the Company announced its intention to separate the Company’s Consumer Health business, with the intention to create a new, publicly traded company. The Company is targeting completion of the planned separation in 18 to 24 months after initial announcement. New Accounting Standards Recently Adopted Accounting Standards There were no new material accounting standards adopted in fiscal 2021. Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Adopted as of January 2, 2022 The Company assesses the adoption impacts of recently issued accounting standards by the Financial Accounting Standards Board on the Company's financial statements as well as material updates to previous assessments, if any, from the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021. There were no new material accounting standards issued in fiscal 2021 that impacted the Company. ASU 2021-01: Reference Rate Reform In mid- 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announced that it will no longer require banks to submit rates for the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) after 2021 hence market participants should work to transition to alternative reference rates (Reference Rate Reform) and should not rely on LIBOR being available after the end of 2021. Reference rate reform is the term used to refer to the efforts that have been undertaken by regulators and other market participants to introduce new reference rates that are based on a larger and more liquid population of observable transactions. The Company evaluated the implications of reference rate reform and applicable financial reporting guidance in ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting on its key financial and commercial contracts that referenced LIBOR including any hedging relationships. Most contracts reviewed will mature prior to the termination of LIBOR or will be modified to apply a new reference rate (primarily the Secured Overnight Financing Rate “SOFR” where applicable). The company also applied available practical expedients under ASC 848 to in scope financial and commercial contracts that previously referenced LIBOR when applicable. As a result, the Company's implementation of any reference rate reform provisions to commercial and financial contracts did not result in any material change for the Company. Cash Equivalents The Company classifies all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of three months or less from date of purchase as cash equivalents and all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of greater than three months from the date of purchase as current marketable securities. The Company has a policy of making investments only with commercial institutions that have 47 at least an investment grade credit rating. The Company invests its cash primarily in government securities and obligations, corporate debt securities, money market funds and reverse repurchase agreements (RRAs). RRAs are collateralized by deposits in the form of Government Securities and Obligations for an amount not less than 102 % of their value. The Company does not record an asset or liability as the Company is not permitted to sell or repledge the associated collateral. The Company has a policy that the collateral has at least an A (or equivalent) credit rating. The Company utilizes a third party custodian to manage the exchange of funds and ensure that collateral received is maintained at 102 % of the value of the RRAs on a daily basis. RRAs with stated maturities of greater than three months from the date of purchase are classified as marketable securities. Investments Investments classified as held to maturity investments are reported at amortized cost and realized gains or losses are reported in earnings. Investments classified as available-for-sale debt securities are carried at estimated fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Available-for-sale securities available for current operations are classified as current assets otherwise, they are classified as long term. Management determines the appropriate classification of its investment in debt and equity securities at the time of purchase and re-evaluates such determination at each balance sheet date. The Company reviews its investments for impairment and adjusts these investments to fair value through earnings, as required. Property, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. The Company utilizes the straight-line method of depreciation over the estimated useful lives of the assets: Building and building equipment 20 - 30 years Land and leasehold improvements 10 - 20 years Machinery and equipment 2 - 13 years The Company capitalizes certain computer software and development costs, included in machinery and equipment, when incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use. Capitalized software costs are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the software, which generally range from 3 to 8 years. The Company reviews long-lived assets to assess recoverability using undiscounted cash flows. When certain events or changes in operating or economic conditions occur, an impairment assessment may be performed on the recoverability of the carrying value of these assets. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset’s fair value and its carrying value. If quoted market prices are not available, the Company will estimate fair value using a discounted value of estimated future cash flows. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the goods to customers. The Company's global payment terms are typically between 30 to 90 days. Provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns, discounts to customers and governmental clawback provisions are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales. The liability is recognized within Accrued Rebates, Returns, and Promotions on the consolidated balance sheet. Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants, as well as market conditions, including consideration of competitor pricing. Rebates are estimated based on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served. A significant portion of the liability related to rebates is from the sale of the Company's pharmaceutical products within the U.S., primarily t he Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid programs, which amounted to $ 7.7 billion and $ 7.2 billion as of January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021, respectively. The Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through the analysis of wholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally generated information. Sales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals. Sales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in the field, or in specific areas, product recall. The sales returns reserve is based on historical return trends by product and by market as a percent to gross sales. In accordance with the Company’s accounting policies, the Company generally issues credit to customers for returned goods. The Company’s sales returns reserves are accounted for in accordance with the U.S. GAAP guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns reserves are recorded at full sales value. Sales returns in the Consumer Health and Pharmaceutical segments are almost exclusively not resalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the 48 Medical Devices segment are typically resalable but are not material. The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products. The sales returns reserve for the total Company has been approximately 1.0 % of annual net trade sales during each of the fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019. Promotional programs, such as product listing allowances and cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in the same period as related sales. Continuing promotional programs include coupons and volume-based sales incentive programs. The redemption cost of consumer coupons is based on historical redemption experience by product and value. Volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales volumes for the incentive period and are recorded as products are sold. These arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred or recorded as a reduction of revenue. The Company also earns profit-share payments through collaborative arrangements for certain products, which are included in sales to customers. For all years presented, profit-share payments were less than 3.0 % of the total revenues and are included in sales to customers. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further disaggregation of revenue. Shipping and Handling Shipping and handling costs incurred were $ 1.1 billion, $ 1.0 billion and $ 1.0 billion in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and are included in selling, marketing and administrative expense. The amount of revenue received for shipping and handling is less than 0.5 % of sales to customers for all periods presented. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value determined by the first-in, first-out method. Intangible Assets and Goodwill The authoritative literature on U.S. GAAP requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives be assessed annually for impairment. The Company completed its annual impairment test for 2021 in the fiscal fourth quarter. Future impairment tests will be performed annually in the fiscal fourth quarter, or sooner if warranted. Purchased in-process research and development is accounted for as an indefinite lived intangible asset until the underlying project is completed, at which point the intangible asset will be accounted for as a definite lived intangible asset, or abandoned, at which point the intangible asset will be written off or partially impaired. Intangible assets that have finite useful lives continue to be amortized over their useful lives, and are reviewed for impairment when warranted by economic conditions. See Note 5 for further details on Intangible Assets and Goodwill. Financial Instruments As required by U.S. GAAP, all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Fair value is the exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is a market-based measurement determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The authoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value, with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction. The Company documents all relationships between hedged items and derivatives. The overall risk management strategy includes reasons for undertaking hedge transactions and entering into derivatives. The objectives of this strategy are: (1) minimize foreign currency exposure’s impact on the Company’s financial performance; (2) protect the Company’s cash flow from adverse movements in foreign exchange rates; (3) ensure the appropriateness of financial instruments; and (4) manage the enterprise risk associated with financial institutions. See Note 6 for additional information on Financial Instruments. Leases The Company determines whether an arrangement is a lease at contract inception by establishing if the contract conveys the right to control the use of identified property, plant, or equipment for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Right of Use (ROU) Assets and Lease Liabilities for operating leases are included in Other assets , Accrued liabilities , and Other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. The ROU Assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent an obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Commitments under finance leases are not significant, and are included in Property, plant and equipment, Loans and notes payable, and Long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheet. ROU Assets and Lease Liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of all minimum lease payments over the lease term. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments, when the implicit rate is not readily determinable. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease. These options are included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company has elected the following policy elections on adoption: use of portfolio approach 49 on leases of assets under master service agreements, exclusion of short term leases on the balance sheet, and not separating lease and non-lease components. The Company primarily has operating lease for space, vehicles, manufacturing equipment and data processing equipment. The ROU asset pertaining to operating leases was $ 0.9 billion and $ 1.0 billion in 2021 and 2020, respectively. The lease liability was $ 1.0 billion and $ 1.1 billion in 2021and 2020, respectively. The operating lease costs were $ 0.3 billion, $ 0.3 billion and $ 0.3 billion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities were $ 0.3 billion, $ 0.3 billion and $ 0.3 billion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Product Liability Accruals for product liability claims are recorded, on an undiscounted basis, when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information and actuarially determined estimates where applicable. The accruals are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available. The Company accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to defend each matter when those costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. To the extent adverse verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals in the self insurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated. Research and Development Research and development expenses are expensed as incurred in accordance with ASC 730, Research and Development. Upfront and milestone payments made to third parties in connection with research and development collaborations are expensed as incurred up to the point of regulatory approval. Payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related product. Amounts capitalized for such payments are included in other intangibles, net of accumulated amortization. The Company enters into collaborative arrangements, typically with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies, to develop and commercialize drug candidates or intellectual property. These arrangements typically involve two (or more) parties who are active participants in the collaboration and are exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of the activities. These collaborations usually involve various activities by one or more parties, including research and development, marketing and selling and distribution. Often, these collaborations require upfront, milestone and royalty or profit share payments, contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development. Amounts due from collaborative partners related to development activities are generally reflected as a reduction of research and development expense because the performance of contract development services is not central to the Company’s operations. In general, the income statement presentation for these collaborations is as follows: Nature/Type of Collaboration Statement of Earnings Presentation Third-party sale of product & profit share payments received Sales to customers Royalties/milestones paid to collaborative partner (post-regulatory approval)* Cost of products sold Royalties received from collaborative partner Other income (expense), net Upfront payments & milestones paid to collaborative partner (pre-regulatory approval) Research and development expense Research and development payments to collaborative partner Research and development expense Research and development payments received from collaborative partner or government entity Reduction of Research and development expense * Milestones are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to cost of products sold over the useful life. For all years presented, there was no individual project that represented greater than 5 % of the total annual consolidated research and development expense. The Company has a number of products and compounds developed in collaboration with strategic partners including XARELTO ® , co-developed with Bayer HealthCare AG and IMBRUVICA ® , developed in collaboration and co-marketed with Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie company. Separately, the Company has a number of licensing arrangements for products and compounds including DARZALEX ® , licensed from Genmab A/S. Advertising Costs associated with advertising are expensed in the year incurred and are included in selling, marketing and administrative expenses. Advertising expenses worldwide, which comprised television, radio, print media and Internet advertising, were $ 2.7 billion, $ 2.1 billion and $ 2.2 billion in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 50 Income Taxes Income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and include the results of any difference between U.S. GAAP accounting and tax reporting, recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities. The Company estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on enacted tax regulations and rates. Future changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. The Company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company follows U.S. GAAP which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Management believes that changes in these estimates would not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial position. In 2017, the United States enacted into law new U.S. tax legislation, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). This law included provisions for a comprehensive overhaul of the corporate income tax code, including a reduction of the statutory corporate tax rate from 35 % to 21 %, effective on January 1, 2018. The TCJA included a provision for a tax on all previously undistributed earnings of U.S. companies located in foreign jurisdictions. Undistributed earnings in the form of cash and cash equivalents were taxed at a rate of 15.5 % and all other earnings were taxed at a rate of 8.0 %. This tax is payable over 8 years and will not accrue interest. These payments began in 2018 and will continue through 2025. The remaining balance at the end of the 2021 was approximately $ 6.9 billion, of which $ 6.1 billion is classified as noncurrent and reflected as “Long-term taxes payable” on the Company’s balance sheet. The balance of this account is related to receivables from tax authorities not expected to be received in the next 12 months. The TCJA also includes provisions for a tax on global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI). GILTI is described as the excess of a U.S. shareholder’s total net foreign income over a deemed return on tangible assets, as provided by the TCJA. In January 2018, the FASB issued guidance that allows companies to elect as an accounting policy whether to record the tax effects of GILTI in the period the tax liability is generated (i.e., “period cost”) or provide for deferred tax assets and liabilities related to basis differences that exist and are expected to effect the amount of GILTI inclusion in future years upon reversal (i.e., “deferred method”). The Company has elected to account for GILTI under the deferred method. The deferred tax amounts recorded are based on the evaluation of temporary differences that are expected to reverse as GILTI is incurred in future periods. The Company has recorded deferred tax liabilities on all undistributed earnings prior to December 31, 2017 from its international subsidiaries. The Company has not provided deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings subsequent to January 1, 2018 from certain international subsidiaries where the earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. The Company intends to continue to reinvest these earnings in those international operations. If the Company decides at a later date to repatriate these earnings to the U.S., the Company would be required to provide for the net tax effects on these amounts. The Company estimates that the tax effect of this repatriation would be approximately $ 0.7 billion under currently enacted tax laws and regulations and at current currency exchange rates. This amount does not include the possible benefit of U.S. foreign tax credits, which may substantially offset this cost. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding income taxes. Net Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities were exercised or converted into common stock using the treasury stock method. Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Estimates are used when accounting for sales discounts, rebates, allowances and incentives, product liabilities, income taxes, withholding taxes, depreciation, amortization, employee benefits, contingencies and intangible asset and liability valuations. Actual results may or may not differ from those estimates. The Company follows the provisions of U.S. GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies. A liability is recorded when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. The best estimate of a loss within a range is accrued; however, if no estimate in the range is better than any other, the minimum amount is accrued. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts the Company’s business and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors including, but not limited to: the magnitude and duration of COVID-19, the extent to which it will impact worldwide macroeconomic conditions including interest rates, employment rates and health insurance coverage, the speed of the anticipated recovery, and governmental and business reactions to the pandemic. The Company assessed certain accounting matters that generally require consideration of forecasted financial information in context with the information reasonably available to the Company and the unknown future impacts of COVID-19 as of January 2, 2022 and through the date of this report. The accounting matters assessed included, but were not limited to, the Company’s allowance for doubtful accounts and credit losses, inventory and related reserves, accrued rebates and associated reserves, and the carrying value of the goodwill and other long-lived assets along with the Company’s on-going vaccine development and distribution efforts. While there was not a material impact to the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended January 2, 2022, the Company’s future assessment of the magnitude and duration of COVID-19, as well as other factors, could result in material impacts to the Company’s consolidated financial statements in future reporting periods. 51 Annual Closing Date The Company follows the concept of a fiscal year, which ends on the Sunday nearest to the end of the month of December. Normally each fiscal year consists of 52 weeks, but every five or six years the fiscal year consists of 53 weeks, and therefore includes additional shipping days, as was the case in fiscal year 2020, and will be the case again in fiscal year 2026. Reclassification Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation. 52 2.

The Company has a policy of making investments only with commercial institutions that have at least an investment grade credit rating. 3. Inventories At the end of fiscal years 2021 and 2020, inventories were comprised of: (Dollars in Millions) 2021 2020 Raw materials and supplies $ 1,592 1,410 Goods in process 2,287 2,040 Finished goods 6,508 5,894 Total inventories $ 10,387 9,344 4. Property, Plant and Equipment At the end of fiscal years 2021 and 2020, property, plant and equipment at cost and accumulated depreciation were: (Dollars in Millions) 2021 2020 Land and land improvements $ 884 882 Buildings and building equipment 12,882 12,502 Machinery and equipment 29,774 29,104 Construction in progress 4,139 4,316 Total property, plant and equipment, gross $ 47,679 46,804 Less accumulated depreciation 28,717 28,038 Total property, plant and equipment, net (1) $ 18,962 18,766 The Company capitalizes interest expense as part of the cost of construction of facilities and equipment. Interest expense capitalized in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $ 49 million, $ 63 million and $ 70 million, respectively. Depreciation expense, including the amortization of capitalized interest in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $ 2.7 billion, $ 2.6 billion and $ 2.5 billion, respectively. Upon retirement or other disposal of property, plant and equipment, the costs and related amounts of accumulated depreciation or amortization are eliminated from the asset and accumulated depreciation accounts, respectively. The difference, if any, between the net asset value and the proceeds are recorded in earnings. 54 5. Intangible Assets and Goodwill At the end of fiscal years 2021 and 2020, the gross and net amounts of intangible assets were: (Dollars in Millions) 2021 2020 Intangible assets with definite lives: Patents and trademarks — gross $ 38,572 39,990 Less accumulated amortization ( 20,088 ) ( 17,618 ) Patents and trademarks — net $ 18,484 22,372 Customer relationships and other intangibles — gross $ 23,011 22,898 Less accumulated amortization ( 11,925 ) ( 10,912 ) Customer relationships and other intangibles — net (1) $ 11,086 11,986 Intangible assets with indefinite lives: Trademarks $ 6,985 7,195 Purchased in-process research and development (2) 9,837 11,849 Total intangible assets with indefinite lives $ 16,822 19,044 Total intangible assets — net $ 46,392 53,402 (1) The majority is comprised of customer relationships (2) In fiscal 2021, the Company recorded a partial IPR&D impairment charge of $ 0.9 billion primarily related to expected development delays in the general surgery digital robotics platform (Ottava) acquired with the Auris Health acquisition in 2019. The impairment charge was calculated based on revisions to the discounted cash flow valuation model reflecting a delay of first in human procedures of approximately two years from the initial acquisition model assumption of the second half of 2022. The remaining reduction was driven by assets that reached commercialization and are now classified as having definite lives. Goodwill as of January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021, as allocated by segment of business, was as follows: (Dollars in Millions) Consumer Health Pharmaceutical Medical Devices Total Goodwill at December 29, 2019 $ 9,736 9,169 14,734 33,639 Goodwill, related to acquisitions — 1,222 238 1,460 Currency translation/other 600 618 76 1,294 Goodwill at January 3, 2021 $ 10,336 11,009 15,048 36,393 Goodwill, related to acquisitions — — — — Goodwill, related to divestitures ( 9 ) — — ( 9 ) Currency translation/other ( 517 ) ( 429 ) ( 192 ) ( 1,138 ) Goodwill at January 2, 2022 $ 9,810 10,580 14,856 35,246 The weighted average amortization period for patents and trademarks is 12 years. The weighted average amortization period for customer relationships and other intangible assets is 21 years. The amortization expense of amortizable assets included in Cost of products sold was $ 4.7 billion, $ 4.7 billion and $ 4.5 billion before tax, for the fiscal years ended January 2, 2022, January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019, respectively. Intangible asset write-downs are included in Other (income) expense, net. The estimated amortization expense for approved products, before tax, for the five succeeding years is approximately: (Dollars in Millions) 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 $ 4,600 4,600 4,400 3,600 3,000 See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to acquisitions and divestitures. 6. Fair Value Measurements 55 The Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to manage its exposure to the variability of cash flows, primarily related to the foreign exchange rate changes of future intercompany products and third-party purchases of materials denominated in a foreign currency. The Company uses cross currency interest rate swaps to manage currency risk primarily related to borrowings. Both types of derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges. Additionally, the Company uses interest rate swaps as an instrument to manage interest rate risk related to fixed rate borrowings. These derivatives are designated as fair value hedges. The Company uses cross currency interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges. Additionally, the Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to offset its exposure to certain foreign currency assets and liabilities. These forward foreign exchange contracts are not designated as hedges and therefore, changes in the fair values of these derivatives are recognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the related foreign currency assets and liabilities. The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes, or that contain credit risk related contingent features. The Company maintains credit support agreements (CSA) with certain derivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on respective credit ratings and netting agreements. As of January 2, 2022, the total amount of cash collateral paid by the Company under the CSA amounted to $ 570 million net, related to net investment and cash flow hedges. On an ongoing basis, the Company monitors counter-party credit ratings. The Company considers credit non-performance risk to be low, because the Company primarily enters into agreements with commercial institutions that have at least an investment grade credit rating. Refer to the table on significant financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value contained in this footnote for receivables and payables with these commercial institutions. As of January 2, 2022, the Company had notional amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange contracts, cross currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps of $ 45.8 billion, $ 37.4 billion and $ 10.0 billion, respectively. As of January 3, 2021, the Company had notional amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange contracts and cross currency interest rate swaps of $ 37.8 billion and $ 30.6 billion, respectively. All derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction. The designation as a cash flow hedge is made at the entrance date of the derivative contract. At inception, all derivatives are expected to be highly effective. Foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges are accounted for under the forward method and all gains/losses associated with these contracts will be recognized in the income statement when the hedged item impacts earnings. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income until the underlying transaction affects earnings, and are then reclassified to earnings in the same account as the hedged transaction. Gains and losses associated with interest rate swaps and changes in fair value of hedged debt attributable to changes in interest rates are recorded to interest expense in the period in which they occur. Gains and losses on net investment hedge are accounted through the currency translation account within accumulated other comprehensive income. The portion excluded from effectiveness testing is recorded through interest (income) expense using the spot method. On an ongoing basis, the Company assesses whether each derivative continues to be highly effective in offsetting changes of hedged items. If and when a derivative is no longer expected to be highly effective, hedge accounting is discontinued. The Company designated its Euro denominated notes issued in May 2016 with due dates ranging from 2022 to 2035 as a net investment hedge of the Company's investments in certain of its international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their functional currency in order to reduce the volatility caused by changes in exchange rates. As of January 2, 2022, the balance of deferred net loss on derivatives included in accumulated other comprehensive income was $ 336 million after-tax. For additional information, see the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and Note 13. The Company expects that substantially all of the amounts related to forward foreign exchange contracts will be reclassified into earnings over the next 12 months as a result of transactions that are expected to occur over that period. The maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging transaction exposure is 18 months, excluding interest rate contracts and net investment hedges. The amount ultimately realized in earnings may differ as foreign exchange rates change. Realized gains and losses are ultimately determined by actual exchange rates at maturity of the derivative. 56 The following table is a summary of the activity related to derivatives and hedges for the fiscal years ended January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021, net of tax: January 2, 2022 January 3, 2021 (Dollars in Millions) Sales Cost of Products Sold R&D Expense Interest (Income) Expense Other (Income) Expense Sales Cost of Products Sold R&D Expense Interest (Income) Expense Other (Income) Expense The effects of fair value, net investment and cash flow hedging: Gain (Loss) on fair value hedging relationship: Interest rate swaps contracts: Hedged items $ — — — ( 109 ) — — — — — — Derivatives designated as hedging instruments — — — 109 — — — — — — Gain (Loss) on net investment hedging relationship: Cross currency interest rate swaps contracts: Amount of gain or (loss) recognized in income on derivative amount excluded from effectiveness testing $ — — — 174 — — — — 153 — Amount of gain or (loss) recognized in AOCI — — — 174 — — — — 153 — Gain (Loss) on cash flow hedging relationship: Forward foreign exchange contracts: Amount of gain or (loss) reclassified from AOCI into income 17 119 30 — 47 12 ( 329 ) ( 137 ) — ( 16 ) Amount of gain or (loss) recognized in AOCI ( 94 ) ( 557 ) 123 — 146 44 298 ( 91 ) — ( 52 ) Cross currency interest rate swaps contracts: Amount of gain or (loss) reclassified from AOCI into income — — — 402 — — — — 370 — Amount of gain or (loss) recognized in AOCI $ — — — 9 — — — — 748 — As of January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021, the following amounts were recorded on the consolidated balance sheet related to cumulative basis adjustment for fair value hedges Line item in the Consolidated Balance Sheet in which the hedged item is included Carrying Amount of the Hedged Liability Cumulative Amount of Fair Value Hedging Adjustment Included in the Carrying Amount of the Hedged Liability (Dollars in Millions) January 2, 2022 January 3, 2021 January 2, 2022 January 3, 2021 Long-term Debt $ 9,793 $ — $ ( 142 ) $ — 57 The following table is the effect of derivatives not designated as hedging instrument for the fiscal years ended January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021: (Dollars in Millions) Location of Gain /(Loss) Recognized in Income on Derivative Gain/(Loss) Recognized In Income on Derivative Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments January 2, 2022 January 3, 2021 Foreign Exchange Contracts Other (income) expense $ ( 70 ) 24 The following table is the effect of net investment hedges for the fiscal years ended January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021: Gain/(Loss) Recognized In Accumulated OCI Location of Gain or (Loss) Reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income Into Income Gain/(Loss) Reclassified From Accumulated OCI Into Income (Dollars in Millions) January 2, 2022 January 3, 2021 January 2, 2022 January 3, 2021 Debt $ 387 ( 473 ) Interest (income) expense — — Cross Currency interest rate swaps $ 548 65 Interest (income) expense — — The Company holds equity investments with readily determinable fair values and equity investments without readily determinable fair values. The Company measures equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. The following table is a summary of the activity related to equity investments for the fiscal years ended January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021: January 3, 2021 January 2, 2022 (Dollars in Millions) Carrying Value Changes in Fair Value Reflected in Net Income (1) Sales/ Purchases/Other (2) Carrying Value Non Current Other Assets Equity Investments with readily determinable value $ 1,481 198 205 1,884 1,884 Equity Investments without readily determinable value $ 738 394 ( 632 ) 500 500 December 29, 2019 January 3, 2021 (Dollars in Millions) Carrying Value Changes in Fair Value Reflected in Net Income (1) Sales/ Purchases/Other (2) Carrying Value Non Current Other Assets Equity Investments with readily determinable value $ 1,148 527 ( 194 ) 1,481 1,481 Equity Investments without readily determinable value $ 712 ( 55 ) 81 738 738 (1) Recorded in Other Income/Expense (2) Other includes impact of currency 58 For the fiscal years ended January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021 for equity investments without readily determinable market values, $ 28 million and $ 76 million, respectively, of the changes in fair value reflected in net income were the result of impairments. There were offsetting impacts of $ 422 million and $ 21 million, respectively, of changes in fair value reflected in net income due to changes in observable prices and gains on the disposal of investments. The impact in fiscal 2021 was driven by the gain on disposal of the Grail investment. Fair value is the exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is a market-based measurement determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. In accordance with ASC 820, a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels within the hierarchy are described below with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest. The fair value of a derivative financial instrument (i.e., forward foreign exchange contracts, interest rate contracts) is the aggregation by currency of all future cash flows discounted to its present value at the prevailing market interest rates and subsequently converted to the U.S. Dollar at the current spot foreign exchange rate. The Company does not believe that fair values of these derivative instruments materially differ from the amounts that could be realized upon settlement or maturity, or that the changes in fair value will have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position. The Company also holds equity investments which are classified as Level 1 and debt securities which are classified as Level 2. The Company holds acquisition related contingent liabilities based upon certain regulatory and commercial events, which are classified as Level 3, whose values are determined using discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques for which the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimations. The following three levels of inputs are used to measure fair value: Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. Level 2 — Significant other observable inputs. Level 3 — Significant unobservable inputs. The Company’s significant financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value as of the fiscal year ended January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021 were as follows: 2021 2020 (Dollars in Millions) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Total (1) Derivatives designated as hedging instruments: Assets: Forward foreign exchange contracts $ — 540 — 540 849 Interest rate contracts (2) — 796 — 796 240 Total $ — 1,336 — 1,336 1,089 Liabilities: Forward foreign exchange contracts — 881 — 881 702 Interest rate contracts (2) — 979 — 979 1,569 Total $ — 1,860 — 1,860 2,271 Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments: Assets: Forward foreign exchange contracts $ — 24 — 24 49 Liabilities: Forward foreign exchange contracts — 28 — 28 38 Available For Sale Other Investments: Equity investments (3) 1,884 — — 1,884 1,481 Debt securities (4) — 19,727 — 19,727 14,042 Other Liabilities Contingent Consideration (5) $ 533 533 633 59 Gross to Net Derivative Reconciliation 2021 2020 (Dollars in Millions) Total Gross Assets $ 1,360 1,138 Credit Support Agreement (CSA) ( 1,285 ) ( 1,107 ) Total Net Asset 75 31 Total Gross Liabilities 1,888 2,309 Credit Support Agreement (CSA) ( 1,855 ) ( 2,172 ) Total Net Liabilities $ 33 137 Summarized information about changes in liabilities for contingent consideration is as follows: 2021 2020 2019 (Dollars in Millions) Beginning Balance $ 633 1,715 397 Changes in estimated fair value (6) ( 52 ) ( 1,089 ) 151 Additions — 106 1,246 Payments ( 48 ) ( 99 ) ( 79 ) Ending Balance $ 533 633 1,715 (1) 2020 assets and liabilities are all classified as Level 2 with the exception of equity investments of $ 1,481 million, which are classified as Level 1 and contingent consideration of $ 633 million, classified as Level 3.

Includes $ 13 million, $ 39 million and $ 84 million classified as current liabilities as of January 2, 2022, January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019, respectively. (6) Ongoing fair value adjustment amounts are recorded primarily in Research and Development expense. The Company recorded a contingent consideration reversal of $ 1,148 million in 2020 related to the timing of certain developmental milestones associated with the Auris Health acquisition.

(4) The excess of the fair value over the carrying value of debt was $ 3.2 billion at the end of fiscal year 2021 and $ 5.4 billion at the end of fiscal year 2020. Fair value of the long-term debt was estimated using market prices, which were corroborated by quoted broker prices and significant other observable inputs. The Company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous banks worldwide. In September 2021, the Company secured a new 364-day Credit Facility. Total credit available to the Company approximates $ 10 billion, which expires on September 8, 2022. Interest charged on borrowings under the credit line agreement is based on either the Term SOFR Reference Rate or other applicable market rates as allowed under the terms of the agreement, plus applicable margins. Commitment fees under the agreements are not material. Throughout fiscal years 2021 and 2020, the Company continued to have access to liquidity through the commercial paper market. Short-term borrowings and the current portion of long-term debt amounted to approximately $ 3.8 billion and $ 2.6 billion at the end of fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. The current portion of the long term debt was $ 2.1 billion and $ 1.8 billion in 2021 and 2020, respectively, and the remainder is commercial paper and local borrowing by international subsidiaries. The current debt balance as of January 2, 2022 includes $ 1.6 billion of commercial paper which has a weighted average interest rate of 0.11 % and a weighted average maturity of approximately three months .

International operations reflects the impacts of operations in jurisdictions with statutory tax rates different than the U.S., particularly Ireland, Switzerland and Puerto Rico, which is a favorable impact on the effective tax rate as compared with the U.S. statutory rate. The 2021 amounts include the reorganization of international subsidiaries; the 2020 and 2019 amounts include the impact of the new tax legislation enactment in Switzerland, both of which are further described below. (2) Includes the impact of the GILTI tax, the Foreign-Derived Intangible Income deduction and other foreign income that is taxable under the U.S. tax code. The 2021 amounts include the reorganization of international subsidiaries; the 2020 and 2019 amounts include the impact of the new tax legislation enactment in Switzerland, both of which is further described below. (3) Represents impact of adjustments to balances originally recorded as part of the 2017 TCJA provisional tax charge. Further information provided below. The fiscal year 2021 tax rate decreased by 2.5 % compared to the fiscal year 2020 tax rate, which was primarily driven by the following items. In fiscal year 2021, the Company reorganized the ownership structure of certain wholly-owned international subsidiaries. As part of this reorganization, the Company increased the tax basis of certain assets to fair value in accordance with applicable local regulations. The net impact of this restructuring was approximately $ 0.6 billion net benefit or 2.7 % benefit to the Company’s annual effective tax rate, comprised of the following items: • approximately $ 2.3 billion of local deferred tax assets to record the remeasurement of the tax basis of these assets to fair value, this benefit has been reflected as “International Operations” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation. • approximately $ 1.7 billion of U.S. deferred tax expense relating to the GILTI deferred tax liability resulting from the remeasurement of these deferred tax assets. This expense has been reflected as “U.S. tax on international income” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation. Also, in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2021, the Company recognized a loss on certain U.S. affiliates related to the previously impaired book value of certain intangibles, which reduced the 2021 tax rate by approximately 1.3 % which is reflected as a “Tax benefits from loss on capital assets” on the effective tax rate reconciliation. Additionally other fiscal 2021 impacts to the rate were primarily driven by litigation and acquisition related items as follows: • the Company accrued additional legal expenses, of approximately $ 1.6 billion for talc at an effective tax rate of 23.5 % and $ 0.8 billion for Risperdal settlements at an effective tax rate of 16.4 % (See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details). • the Company recorded a partial IPR&D charge of $ 0.9 billion for the Ottava intangible asset (acquired with the Auris Health acquisition in 2019) at an effective rate of 22.4 % (See Notes 5 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details). The fiscal year 2020 tax rate decreased by 1.9 % compared to the fiscal year 2019 tax rate. which was primarily driven by the following items. In fiscal year 2019, Switzerland enacted the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (TRAF) which became effective on January 1, 2020. The Federal transitional provisions of TRAF allow companies, under certain conditions, to adjust the tax basis in certain assets to fair value (i.e., “step-up”) to be depreciated and amortized resulting in an incremental Swiss tax deduction over the transitional period. TRAF also provides for parameters which enable the Swiss cantons to establish localized tax rates and regulations for companies. The new cantonal tax parameters include favorable tax benefits for patents and additional research and development 63 tax deductions. The cantonal transitional provisions of TRAF allowed companies to elect either 1) tax basis step-up similar to the Federal transition benefit or 2) alternative statutory tax rate for a period not to exceed 5 years. The Company currently has operations located in various Swiss cantons. During the fiscal year 2019, as described in further detail below, the Company recorded the impacts of the TRAF that were enacted in that period. During the fiscal year 2020, the final canton where the Company maintains significant operations enacted TRAF legislation. Additionally, the Company received rulings from the Swiss Federal and cantonal tax authorities in the remaining jurisdictions where it has significant operations. These rulings resulted in the Company revising its estimate on the tax basis adjustment (i.e., “step-up”) for its assets and as a result, the Company recorded additional deferred tax benefits in 2020. The Company recognized a net benefit in the fiscal year 2020 for Swiss Tax Reform of approximately $ 0.4 billion or 2.6 % benefit to the Company’s annual effective tax rate, comprised of the following items: • approximately $ 0.3 billion tax benefit relating to the remeasurement of Swiss deferred tax assets and liabilities for the change in the Federal and cantonal tax rates, where enactment occurred in the fiscal year 2020; this benefit has been reflected as “International Operations” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation. • a $ 450 million deferred tax asset related to the estimated value of a Federal tax basis step-up of the Company’s Swiss subsidiaries’ assets as described above; this benefit has been reflected as “International Operations” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation. • approximately $ 0.3 billion of U.S. deferred tax expense relating to the GILTI deferred tax liability resulting from the remeasurement of the Swiss deferred tax assets and liabilities in the fiscal year 2020. This benefit has been reflected as “U.S. tax on international income” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation. The Company does not expect to receive future rulings regarding the transitional provisions of TRAF. Also, in the fiscal year 2020, the Company recognized a capital loss on certain U.S. affiliates related to the previously impaired book value of certain intangibles, which reduced the 2020 tax rate by approximately 1.2 % which is reflected as a “Tax benefits from loss on capital assets” on the effective tax rate reconciliation. In addition, in the fiscal year 2020, the Company had lower income in higher tax jurisdictions, primarily driven by: • the impact of the accrual of litigation costs related to talc for $ 4.0 billion which reduced the U.S. earnings before taxes at an effective tax rate of 23.5 %; • the accrual of additional legal costs, including an additional $ 1.0 billion associated with a revised agreement in principle to settle opioid litigation at an effective tax rate of 21.4 % The Company also reduced the contingent consideration liability related to the Auris Health acquisition (see Note 18) and reversed of some of its unrecognized tax benefits due to the completion of several years of tax examinations in certain jurisdictions during the fiscal year 2020. In fiscal year 2019, the Company reorganized the ownership structure of certain wholly-owned international subsidiaries in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2019, which resulted in a reduction of certain withholding and local taxes that it had previously recognized as part of the provisional Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) tax charge in the fiscal year 2017 and finalized in the fiscal year 2018. Following the completion of this restructuring and approval by the applicable local authorities, the Company reversed a deferred tax liability of $ 0.6 billion and a related deferred tax asset of $ 0.2 billion for U.S. foreign tax credits, for a net deferred tax benefit of $ 0.4 billion decreasing the annual effective tax rate by 2.2 %. This benefit has been reflected as “TCJA and related impacts” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation. The following items also impacted the fiscal year 2019 effective tax rate: • The impact of the agreement in principle to settle opioid litigation for $ 4 billion (see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) which reduced the U.S. earnings before taxes at an effective tax rate of 23.5 % and decreased the Company’s annual effective tax rate by approximately 2.1 %. • In December of fiscal year 2019, the U.S. Treasury issued final foreign tax credit regulations, which resulted in the Company revising the amount of foreign tax credits that were initially recorded in the fiscal year 2017 as part of the provisional TCJA tax charge. As a result, the Company recorded an increased deferred tax asset related to these foreign tax credits of approximately $ 0.3 billion or 1.7 % to the annual effective tax rate. This benefit has been reflected as “TCJA and related impacts” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation. • The Company reassessed its uncertain tax positions related to the current IRS audit and increased its unrecognized tax benefit by $ 0.3 billion liability which increased the annual effective tax rate by approximately 1.5 % (see section on Unrecognized Tax Benefits for additional information). As these positions were related to uncertain tax regarding international transfer pricing, this expense has been classified as “International Operations” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation. 64 As described above for the Swiss tax legislation, in the fiscal year 2019, the Company recorded a net tax expense of $ 0.1 billion which increased the effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2019 by approximately 0.6 %. This net tax expense related to federal and certain cantonal enactments in the fiscal year 2019 consisting of the following provisions: • approximately $ 0.6 billion tax expense relating to the remeasurement of Swiss deferred tax assets and liabilities for the change in the Federal and cantonal tax rates, where enactment occurred by December 29, 2019; this expense has been reflected as “International Operations” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation. • a $ 0.9 billion deferred tax asset related to the estimated value of a Federal tax basis step-up of the Company’s Swiss subsidiaries’ assets; this benefit has been reflected as “International Operations” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation. • approximately $ 450 million of U.S. deferred tax expense relating to the GILTI deferred tax liability resulting from the remeasurement of the Swiss deferred tax assets and liabilities and the new deferred tax asset for the Federal step-up. This benefit has been reflected as “U.S. tax on international income” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation. Temporary differences and carryforwards at the end of fiscal years 2021 and 2020 were as follows: 2021 Deferred Tax 2020 Deferred Tax (1) (Dollars in Millions) Asset Liability Asset Liability Employee related obligations $ 1,244 2,434 Stock based compensation 679 627 Depreciation of property, plant and equipment ( 876 ) ( 823 ) Goodwill and intangibles ( 2,659 ) (2) ( 5,023 ) R&D capitalized for tax 1,664 1,517 Reserves & liabilities 2,882 3,466 Income reported for tax purposes 2,566 1,777 Net realizable operating loss carryforward 1,073 990 Undistributed foreign earnings 1,015 ( 1,461 ) 812 ( 1,435 ) Global intangible low-taxed income ( 4,853 ) ( 3,606 ) Miscellaneous international 1,006 ( 39 ) 854 ( 211 ) Miscellaneous U.S. 495 ( 59 ) Total deferred income taxes $ 12,624 ( 9,888 ) 12,477 ( 11,157 ) ( 1) Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation (2) Amount is inclusive of the $ 2.3 billion deferred tax asset established as part of the reorganized ownership structure of certain wholly-owned international subsidiaries, as previously described. The Company has wholly-owned international subsidiaries that have cumulative net losses. The Company believes that it is more likely than not that these subsidiaries will generate future taxable income sufficient to utilize these deferred tax assets. However, in certain jurisdictions, valuation allowances have been recorded against deferred tax assets for loss carryforwards that are not more likely than not to be realized. Such valuation allowances are not material. The following table summarizes the activity related to unrecognized tax benefits: (Dollars in Millions) 2021 2020 2019 Beginning of year $ 3,373 3,853 3,326 Increases related to current year tax positions 242 265 249 Increases related to prior period tax positions 23 668 408 Decreases related to prior period tax positions ( 128 ) ( 551 ) ( 105 ) Settlements ( 187 ) ( 839 ) ( 9 ) Lapse of statute of limitations 0 ( 23 ) ( 16 ) End of year $ 3,323 3,373 3,853 65 The unrecognized tax benefits of $ 3.3 billion at January 2, 2022, if recognized, would affect the Company’s annual effective tax rate. The Company conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and currently has tax audits in progress with a number of tax authorities. With respect to the United States, the IRS has completed its audit for the tax years through 2012 and is currently auditing tax years 2013 through 2016. In the fiscal year 2020, the Company made its final payments for approximately$ 0.7 billion to the U.S. Treasury related to the final settlement of 2010-2012 tax audit liability. In other major jurisdictions where the Company conducts business, the years that remain open to tax audit go back to the year 2008. The Company believes it is possible that tax audits may be completed over the next twelve months by taxing authorities in some jurisdictions outside of the United States. However, the Company is not able to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of any other future tax payments relating to uncertain tax positions. The Company classifies liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties as long-term liabilities, except as previously noted on amounts related to the current United States IRS audit. Interest expense and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax expense. The Company recognized after tax interest expense of $ 44 million, $ 32 million and $ 50 million in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The total amount of accrued interest was $ 512 million and $ 468 million in fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. 9. Employee Related Obligations At the end of fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, employee related obligations recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were: (Dollars in Millions) 2021 2020 Pension benefits $ 4,088 5,761 Postretirement benefits 2,069 2,229 Postemployment benefits 3,117 3,078 Deferred compensation 181 250 Total employee obligations 9,455 11,318 Less current benefits payable 557 547 Employee related obligations — non-current $ 8,898 10,771 Prepaid employee related obligations of $ 4,436 million and $ 656 million for 2021 and 2020, respectively, are included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 66 10. Pensions and Other Benefit Plans The Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit, defined contribution and termination indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide. The Company also provides post-retirement benefits, primarily healthcare, to all eligible U.S. retired employees and their dependents. Many international employees are covered by government-sponsored programs and the cost to the Company is not significant. In the U.S, non-union pension benefits for employees hired before January 1, 2015 are primarily based on the employee’s compensation during the last five years before retirement and the number of years of service (the Final Average Pay formula). U.S. pension benefits for employees hired after 2014, are calculated using a different formula based on employee compensation over total years of service (the Retirement Value formula). In January 2021, the Company announced that, effective on January 1, 2026, all eligible U.S. non-union employees, regardless of hire date, will earn benefits under the Retirement Value formula. This amendment does not affect the benefits accrued under the Final Average Pay formula for service before January 1, 2026. The impact of this change decreases the Projected Benefit Obligation as of January 3, 2021 by approximately $ 1.8 billion and is included in the “Amendments” line in the Change in Benefit Obligation. International subsidiaries have plans under which funds are deposited with trustees, annuities are purchased under group contracts, or reserves are provided. The Company does not fund retiree healthcare benefits in advance and has the right to modify these plans in the future. In 2021 and 2020 the Company used December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, as the measurement date for all U.S. and international retirement and other benefit plans. Net periodic benefit costs for the Company’s defined benefit retirement plans and other benefit plans for 2021, 2020 and 2019 include the following components: Retirement Plans Other Benefit Plans (Dollars in Millions) 2021 2020 2019 2021 2020 2019 Service cost $ 1,421 1,380 1,163 309 287 274 Interest cost 770 955 1,096 81 133 185 Expected return on plan assets ( 2,645 ) ( 2,461 ) ( 2,322 ) ( 7 ) ( 7 ) ( 6 ) Amortization of prior service cost ( 181 ) 2 4 ( 31 ) ( 31 ) ( 31 ) Recognized actuarial losses (gains) 1,257 891 579 151 142 129 Curtailments and settlements 1 23 73 — — — Net periodic benefit cost $ 623 790 593 503 524 551 The service cost component of net periodic benefit cost is presented in the same line items on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings where other employee compensation costs are reported, including Cost of products sold, Research and development expense, and Selling, marketing and administrative expenses. All other components of net periodic benefit cost are presented as part of Other (income) expense, net on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Unrecognized gains and losses for the U.S. pension plans are amortized over the average remaining future service for each plan. For plans with no active employees, they are amortized over the average life expectancy. The amortization of gains and losses for the other U.S. benefit plans is determined by using a 10 % corridor of the greater of the market value of assets or the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation. Total unamortized gains and losses in excess of the corridor are amortized over the average remaining future service. Prior service costs/benefits for the U.S. pension plans are amortized over the average remaining future service of plan participants at the time of the plan amendment. Prior service cost/benefit for the other U.S. benefit plans is amortized over the average remaining service to full eligibility age of plan participants at the time of the plan amendment. 67 The following table represents the weighted-average actuarial assumptions: Retirement Plans Other Benefit Plans Worldwide Benefit Plans 2021 2020 2019 2021 2020 2019 Net Periodic Benefit Cost Service cost discount rate 2.14 % 2.82 3.63 2.09 3.04 4.45 Interest cost discount rate 2.34 % 3.13 4.13 2.33 3.08 4.25 Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.01 % 4.00 3.99 4.25 4.25 4.29 Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets 7.71 % 8.12 8.31 Benefit Obligation Discount rate 2.49 % 2.14 2.91 2.68 2.23 3.39 Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.01 % 4.00 4.01 4.21 4.27 4.29 The Company’s discount rates are determined by considering current yield curves representing high quality, long-term fixed income instruments. The resulting discount rates are consistent with the duration of plan liabilities. The Company's methodology in determining service and interest cost uses duration specific spot rates along that yield curve to the plans' liability cash flows. The expected rates of return on plan asset assumptions represent the Company's assessment of long-term returns on diversified investment portfolios globally. The assessment is determined using projections from external financial sources, long-term historical averages, actual returns by asset class and the various asset class allocations by market.

International Plans are funded in accordance with local regulations. Additional discretionary contributions are made when deemed appropriate to meet the long-term obligations of the plans. For certain plans, funding is not a common practice, as funding provides no economic benefit. Consequently, the Company has several pension plans that are not funded. In 2021, the Company contributed $ 102 million and $ 867 million to its U.S. and international pension plans, respectively. The following table displays the funded status of the Company's U.S. Qualified & Non-Qualified pension plans and international funded and unfunded pension plans at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively: U.S. Plans International Plans Qualified Plans Non-Qualified Plans Funded Plans Unfunded Plans (Dollars in Millions) 2021 2020 2021 2020 2021 2020 2021 2020 Plan Assets $ 27,944 25,554 — — 13,986 12,641 — — Projected Benefit Obligation 25,041 25,466 2,703 2,748 13,428 14,541 410 545 Accumulated Benefit Obligation 23,985 24,158 2,479 2,495 12,212 13,210 373 493 Over (Under) Funded Status Projected Benefit Obligation $ 2,903 88 ( 2,703 ) ( 2,748 ) 558 ( 1,900 ) ( 410 ) ( 545 ) Accumulated Benefit Obligation 3,959 1,396 ( 2,479 ) ( 2,495 ) 1,774 ( 569 ) ( 373 ) ( 493 ) Plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets have an accumulated benefit obligation, projected benefit obligation and plan assets of $ 3.9 billion, $ 4.2 billion and $ 0.3 billion, respectively, at the end of 2021, and $ 8.8 billion, $ 9.8 billion and $ 4.4 billion, respectively, at the end of 2020.

In determining investment policies, strategies and goals, each committee or board considers factors 70 including, local pension rules and regulations; local tax regulations; availability of investment vehicles (separate accounts, commingled accounts, insurance funds, etc.); funded status of the plans; ratio of actives to retirees; duration of liabilities; and other relevant factors including: diversification, liquidity of local markets and liquidity of base currency. A majority of the Company’s pension funds are open to new entrants and are expected to be on-going plans. Permitted investments are primarily liquid and/or listed, with little reliance on illiquid and non-traditional investments such as hedge funds. The Company’s retirement plan asset allocation at the end of 2021 and 2020 and target allocations for 2022 are as follows: Percent of Plan Assets Target Allocation 2021 2020 2022 Worldwide Retirement Plans Equity securities 65 % 66 % 61 % Debt securities 35 34 39 Total plan assets 100 % 100 % 100 % Determination of Fair Value of Plan Assets The Plan has an established and well-documented process for determining fair values. Fair value is based upon quoted market prices, where available. If listed prices or quotes are not available, fair value is based upon models that primarily use, as inputs, market-based or independently sourced market parameters, including yield curves, interest rates, volatilities, equity or debt prices, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. While the Plan believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. Valuation Hierarchy The authoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels within the hierarchy are described in the table below with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest. The Net Asset Value (NAV) is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, minus its liabilities, and then divided by the number of shares outstanding. A financial instrument’s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the investments measured at fair value. • Short-term investment funds — Cash and quoted short-term instruments are valued at the closing price or the amount held on deposit by the custodian bank. Other investments are through investment vehicles valued using the NAV provided by the administrator of the fund. The NAV is a quoted price in a market that is not active and classified as Level 2. • Government and agency securities — A limited number of these investments are valued at the closing price reported on the major market on which the individual securities are traded. Where quoted prices are available in an active market, the investments are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. If quoted market prices are not available for the specific security, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows. When quoted market prices for a security are not available in an active market, they are classified as Level 2. • Debt instruments — A limited number of these investments are valued at the closing price reported on the major market on which the individual securities are traded. Where quoted prices are available in an active market, the investments are classified as Level 1. If quoted market prices are not available for the specific security, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows and are classified as Level 2. Level 3 debt instruments are priced based on unobservable inputs. • Equity securities — Equity securities are valued at the closing price reported on the major market on which the individual securities are traded. Substantially all equity securities are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. • Commingled funds — These investment vehicles are valued using the NAV provided by the fund administrator. Assets in the Level 2 category have a quoted market price. 71 • Other assets — Other assets are represented primarily by limited partnerships. These investment vehicles are valued using the NAV provided by the fund administrator. Other assets that are exchange listed and actively traded are classified as Level 1, while inactively traded assets are classified as Level 2. The following table sets forth the Retirement Plans' investments measured at fair value as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020: Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets Significant Other Observable Inputs Significant Unobservable Inputs (1) Investments Measured at Net Asset Value (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Total Assets (Dollars in Millions) 2021 2020 2021 2020 2021 2020 2021 2020 2021 2020 Short-term investment funds $ 102 127 1,033 763 — — — — 1,135 890 Government and agency securities — — 7,016 5,023 — — — — 7,016 5,023 Debt instruments — — 3,505 3,931 — — — — 3,505 3,931 Equity securities 14,107 14,375 2 2 — — — — 14,109 14,377 Commingled funds — — 5,496 4,690 105 160 8,708 8,236 14,309 13,086 Other assets — — 34 11 15 21 1,807 856 1,856 888 Investments at fair value $ 14,209 14,502 17,086 14,420 120 181 10,515 9,092 41,930 38,195 (1) The activity for the Level 3 assets is not significant for all years presented. The Company's Other Benefit Plans are unfunded except for U.S. commingled funds (Level 2) of $ 102 million and $ 90 million at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The fair value of Johnson & Johnson Common Stock directly held in plan assets was $ 385 million ( 0.9 % of total plan assets) at December 31, 2021 and $ 946 million ( 2.5 % of total plan assets) at December 31, 2020. 11. Savings Plan The Company has voluntary 401(k) savings plans designed to enhance the existing retirement programs covering eligible employees. The Company matches a percentage of each employee’s contributions consistent with the provisions of the plan for which he/she is eligible. Total Company matching contributions to the plans were $ 256 million, $ 243 million and $ 235 million in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 72 12. Capital and Treasury Stock Changes in treasury stock were: Treasury Stock (Amounts in Millions Except Treasury Stock Shares in Thousands) Shares Amount Balance at December 30, 2018 457,519 $ 34,362 Employee compensation and stock option plans ( 20,053 ) ( 2,691 ) Repurchase of common stock 49,870 6,746 Balance at December 29, 2019 487,336 38,417 Employee compensation and stock option plans ( 21,765 ) ( 3,148 ) Repurchase of common stock 21,760 3,221 Balance at January 3, 2021 487,331 38,490 Employee compensation and stock option plans ( 17,399 ) ( 2,847 ) Repurchase of common stock 20,946 3,456 Balance at January 2, 2022 490,878 $ 39,099 Aggregate shares of common stock issued were approximately 3,119,843,000 shares at the end of fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019. Cash dividends paid were $ 4.19 per share in fiscal year 2021, compared with dividends of $ 3.98 per share in fiscal year 2020, and $ 3.75 per share in fiscal year 2019. On January 4, 2022, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $ 1.06 per share, payable on March 8, 2022 to shareholders of record as of February 22, 2022. On December 17, 2018, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program, authorizing the Company to purchase up to $ 5.0 billion of the Company's shares of common stock. This share repurchase program was completed as of September 29, 2019. 13. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) Components of other comprehensive income (loss) consist of the following: (Dollars in Millions) Foreign Currency Translation Gain/(Loss) On Securities Employee Benefit Plans Gain/ (Loss) On Derivatives & Hedges Total Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) December 30, 2018 $ ( 8,869 ) — ( 6,158 ) ( 195 ) ( 15,222 ) Net 2019 changes 164 — ( 733 ) ( 100 ) ( 669 ) December 29, 2019 ( 8,705 ) — ( 6,891 ) ( 295 ) ( 15,891 ) Net 2020 changes ( 233 ) 1 ( 66 ) 947 649 January 3, 2021 ( 8,938 ) 1 ( 6,957 ) 652 ( 15,242 ) Net 2021 changes ( 1,079 ) ( 4 ) 4,255 ( 988 ) 2,184 January 2, 2022 $ ( 10,017 ) ( 3 ) ( 2,702 ) ( 336 ) ( 13,058 ) Amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income are presented net of the related tax impact. Foreign currency translation is not adjusted for income taxes where it relates to permanent investments in international subsidiaries. For additional details on comprehensive income see the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Details on reclassifications out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income: Gain/(Loss) On Securities - reclassifications released to Other (income) expense, net. Employee Benefit Plans - reclassifications are included in net periodic benefit cost. See Note 10 for additional details. Gain/(Loss) On Derivatives & Hedges - reclassifications to earnings are recorded in the same account as the hedged transaction. See Note 6 for additional details. 73 14. International Currency Translation For translation of its subsidiaries operating in non-U.S. Dollar currencies, the Company has determined that the local currencies of its international subsidiaries are the functional currencies except those in highly inflationary economies, which are defined as those which have had compound cumulative rates of inflation of 100% or more during the past three years, or where a substantial portion of its cash flows are not in the local currency. For the majority of the Company's subsidiaries the local currency is the functional currency. In consolidating international subsidiaries, balance sheet currency effects are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. The other current and non-current assets line within the Statement of Cash flows includes the impact of foreign currency translation. This equity account includes the results of translating certain balance sheet assets and liabilities at current exchange rates and some accounts at historical rates, except for those located in highly inflationary economies, (Argentina and Venezuela). The translation of balance sheet accounts for highly inflationary economies are reflected in the operating results. A rollforward of the changes during fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019 for foreign currency translation adjustments is included in Note 13. Net currency transaction gains and losses included in Other (income) expense were losses of $ 236 million, $ 209 million and $ 267 million in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 15. Earnings Per Share The following is a reconciliation of basic net earnings per share to diluted net earnings per share for the fiscal years ended January 2, 2022, January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019: (In Millions Except Per Share Amounts) 2021 2020 2019 Basic net earnings per share $ 7.93 5.59 5.72 Average shares outstanding — basic 2,632.1 2,632.8 2,645.1 Potential shares exercisable under stock option plans 138.0 118.3 136.3 Less: shares repurchased under treasury stock method ( 96.1 ) ( 80.4 ) ( 97.8 ) Convertible debt shares — — 0.7 Adjusted average shares outstanding — diluted 2,674.0 2,670.7 2,684.3 Diluted net earnings per share $ 7.81 5.51 5.63 The diluted net earnings per share calculation for fiscal year 2021 included all shares related to stock options, as the exercise price of these options was less than the average market value of the Company's stock. As of January 2, 2022, the Company did not have convertible debt. The diluted net earnings per share calculation for fiscal year 2020 excluded 18 million shares related to stock options, as the exercise price of these options was greater than the average market value of the Company's stock. As of January 3, 2021, the Company did not have convertible debt. The diluted net earnings per share calculation for fiscal year 2019 excluded an insignificant number of shares related to stock options, as the exercise price of these options was greater than the average market value of the Company’s stock. The diluted net earnings per share calculation for fiscal year 2019 included the dilutive effect of convertible debt that was offset by the related reduction in interest expense of $ 1 million after-tax. 16. Common Stock, Stock Option Plans and Stock Compensation Agreements At January 2, 2022, the Company had 2 stock-based compensation plans. The shares outstanding are for contracts under the Company's 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan and the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan. The 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan expired April 26, 2012. All options and restricted shares granted subsequent to that date were under the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan. Under the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan, the Company may issue up to 650 million shares of common stock, plus any shares canceled, expired, forfeited, or not issued from the 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan subsequent to April 26, 2012. Shares available for future grants under the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan were 240 million at the end of fiscal year 2021. The compensation cost that has been charged against income for these plans was $ 1,135 million, $ 1,005 million and $ 977 million for fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The total income tax benefit recognized in the income statement for share-based compensation costs was $ 218 million, $ 210 million and $ 227 million for fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company also recognized additional income tax benefits of $ 223 million, $ 248 million and $ 209 million for fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, for which options were exercised or restricted shares were vested. The total unrecognized compensation cost was $ 862 million, $ 804 million and $ 823 million for fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, 74 respectively. The weighted average period for this cost to be recognized was 1.78 years, 1.76 years and 1.71 years for fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Share-based compensation costs capitalized as part of inventory were insignificant in all periods. The Company settles employee benefit equity issuances with treasury shares. Treasury shares are replenished through market purchases throughout the year for the number of shares used to settle employee benefit equity issuances. Stock Options Stock options expire 10 years from the date of grant and vest over service periods that range from 6 months to 4 years. All options are granted at the average of the high and low prices of the Company’s Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of grant. The fair value of each option award was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model that uses the assumptions noted in the following table. For 2021, 2020 and 2019 grants, expected volatility represents a blended rate of 10-year weekly historical overall volatility rate, and a 5-week average implied volatility rate based on at-the-money traded Johnson & Johnson options with a life of 2 years. For all grants, historical data is used to determine the expected life of the option. The risk-free rate was based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The average fair value of options granted was $ 20.86 , $ 16.42 and $ 17.80 , in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The fair value was estimated based on the weighted average assumptions of: 2021 2020 2019 Risk-free rate 0.83 % 1.47 % 2.56 % Expected volatility 18.59 % 15.33 % 16.27 % Expected life (in years) 7.0 7.0 7.0 Expected dividend yield 2.50 % 2.60 % 2.80 % A summary of option activity under the Plan as of January 2, 2022, January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019, and changes during the years ending on those dates is presented below: (Shares in Thousands) Outstanding Shares Weighted Average Exercise Price Aggregate Intrinsic Value (Dollars in Millions) Shares at December 30, 2018 109,652 $ 98.29 $ 3,214 Options granted 19,745 131.94 Options exercised ( 14,785 ) 82.43 Options canceled/forfeited ( 2,975 ) 125.11 Shares at December 29, 2019 111,637 105.63 4,478 Options granted 20,723 151.41 Options exercised ( 16,275 ) 86.05 Options canceled/forfeited ( 1,835 ) 137.62 Shares at January 3, 2021 114,250 116.22 4,703 Options granted 18,525 164.62 Options exercised ( 13,248 ) 97.48 Options canceled/forfeited ( 2,166 ) 149.75 Shares at January 2, 2022 117,361 $ 125.36 $ 5,364 The total intrinsic value of options exercised was $ 919 million, $ 1,021 million and $ 807 million in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 75 The following table summarizes stock options outstanding and exercisable at January 2, 2022: (Shares in Thousands) Outstanding Exercisable Exercise Price Range Options Average Life (1) Weighted Average Exercise Price Options Weighted Average Exercise Price $ 65.08 -$ 90.44 16,007 1.6 $ 81.92 16,007 $ 81.92 $ 100.06 -$ 101.87 22,647 3.6 $ 101.07 22,647 $ 101.07 $ 115.67 -$ 129.51 24,543 5.6 $ 122.59 23,972 $ 122.43 $ 131.94 -$ 151.41 36,304 7.6 $ 142.23 100 $ 140.72 $ 151.42 -$ 164.62 17,860 9.1 $ 164.62 16 $ 164.62 117,361 5.8 $ 125.36 62,742 $ 104.42 (1) Average contractual life remaining in years. Stock options outstanding at January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019 were 114,250 and an average life of 6.0 years and 111,637 and an average life of 6.0 years, respectively. Stock options exercisable at January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019 were 61,289 at an average price of $ 96.97 and 60,761 at an average price of $ 88.88 , respectively. Restricted Share Units and Performance Share Units The Company grants restricted share units which vest over service periods that range from 6 months to 3 years. The Company also grants performance share units, which are paid in shares of Johnson & Johnson Common Stock after the end of a three-year performance period. Whether any performance share units vest, and the amount that does vest, is tied to the completion of service periods that range from 6 months to 3 years and the achievement, over a three-year period, of three equally-weighted goals that directly align with or help drive long-term total shareholder return: operational sales, adjusted operational earnings per share, and relative total shareholder return. Beginning in fiscal 2020, performance shares were granted with two equally-weighted goals that directly align with or help drive long-term total shareholder return: adjusted operational earnings per share and relative total shareholder return. The number of shares actually earned at the end of the three-year period will vary, based only on actual performance, from 0 % to 200 % of the target number of performance share units granted . A summary of the restricted share units and performance share units activity under the Plans as of January 2, 2022 is presented below: (Shares in Thousands) Outstanding Restricted Share Units Outstanding Performance Share Units Shares at January 3, 2021 14,998 2,236 Granted 4,981 741 Issued ( 5,101 ) ( 610 ) Canceled/forfeited/adjusted ( 756 ) ( 55 ) Shares at January 2, 2022 14,122 2,312 The average fair value of the restricted share units granted was $ 152.62 , $ 139.58 and $ 121.31 in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, using the fair market value at the date of grant. The fair value of restricted share units was discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the restricted share units during the vesting period. The fair value of restricted share units issued was $ 611 million, $ 650 million and $ 586 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The weighted average fair value of the performance share units granted was $ 179.35 , $ 160.54 and $ 124.67 in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, calculated using the weighted average fair market value for each of the component goals at the date of grant. The fair values for the sales and earnings per share goals of each performance share unit were estimated on the date of grant using the fair market value of the shares at the time of the award discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the performance share units during the vesting period. The fair value for the relative total shareholder return goal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo valuation model.

Acquisitions and Divestitures During fiscal year 2021, the Company did not make any material acquisitions. During fiscal year 2020, certain businesses were acquired for $ 7.3 billion in cash and $ 0.4 billion of liabilities assumed. These acquisitions were accounted for using the acquisition method and, accordingly, results of operations have been included in the financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition. The excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired amounted to $ 7.5 billion and has been assigned to identifiable intangible assets, with any residual recorded to goodwill. The fiscal year 2020 acquisitions primarily included: all rights to the investigational compound bermekimab, which has multiple dermatological indications, along with certain employees from XBiotech Inc. (XBiotech), Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Momenta), a company that discovers and develops novel therapies for immune-mediated diseases and the outstanding shares in Verb Surgical Inc., a company with significant robotics and data science capabilities. During the fiscal first quarter of 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of all rights to the investigational compound bermekimab, which has multiple dermatological indications, along with certain employees from XBiotech Inc., for a purchase price of $ 0.8 billion. The fair value of the acquisition was allocated primarily to non-amortizable intangible assets, primarily IPR&D, for $ 0.8 billion applying a probability of success factor that ranged from 20 % to 60 % to reflect inherent development, regulatory and commercial risk for the different indications. The discount rate applied was approximately 16 %. XBiotech may be eligible to receive additional payments upon the receipt of certain commercialization authorizations. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination and included in the Pharmaceutical segment. On January 28, 2022, subsequent to the fiscal year 2021, additional information regarding efficacy became available which led the Company to the decision to terminate the development of bermekimab for Atopic Dermatitis (AD). The Company recorded an intangible asset impairment charge of approximately $ 0.6 billion related to an in-process research and development asset, bermekimab (JnJ-77474462), an investigational drug for the treatment of AD and Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS). The impairment charge is related to the AD indication and is a nonrecognized subsequent event and will be reflected in the first quarter 2022 financial statements. The Company acquired all rights to bermekimab from XBiotech, Inc. in fiscal year 2020. Additionally, in the fiscal first quarter of 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of all outstanding shares in Verb Surgical Inc., a company with significant robotics and data science capabilities, including those shares previously held by Verily. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination and included in the Medical Devices segment. The fair value of the acquisition was allocated primarily to non-amortizable intangible assets, primarily IPR&D, for $ 0.4 billion, goodwill for $ 0.2 billion, other assets of $ 0.2 billion and liabilities assumed of $ 0.3 billion. The fair value of the Company's previously held equity investment in Verb Surgical Inc. was $ 0.4 billion. On October 1, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of Momenta for a purchase price of approximately $ 6.1 billion, net of cash acquired. The fair value of the acquisition was allocated primarily to non-amortizable intangible assets (IPR&D) of $ 6.0 billion, goodwill of $ 1.2 billion, other assets of $ 0.5 billion and liabilities of $ 1.6 billion. The assets acquired are intended to address substantial unmet medical need in maternal-fetal disorders, neuro-inflammatory disorders, rheumatology, dermatology and autoimmune hematology. Depending on the asset, probability of success factors ranging from 20 % to 77 % were used in the fair value calculation to reflect inherent development and regulatory risk of the IPR&D. The discount rate applied was approximately 13 %. The goodwill is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise from the business acquisition and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination and included in the Pharmaceutical segment. During fiscal year 2019 certain businesses were acquired for $ 5.8 billion in cash and $ 1.4 billion of liabilities assumed. These acquisitions were accounted for using the acquisition method and, accordingly, results of operations have been included in the financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition. The excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired amounted to $ 6.8 billion and has been assigned to identifiable intangible assets, with any residual recorded to goodwill. The fiscal year 2019 acquisitions primarily included DR. CI:LABO, a Japanese company focused on the marketing, development and distribution of a broad range of dermocosmetic, cosmetic and skincare products and Auris Health, Inc. a 84 privately held developer of robotic technologies, initially focused in lung cancer, with an U.S. FDA-cleared platform currently used in bronchoscopic diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. On January 17, 2019, the Company acquired DR. CI:LABO, a Japanese company focused on the marketing, development and distribution of a broad range of dermocosmetic, cosmetic and skincare products for a total purchase price of approximately ¥ 230 billion, which equates to approximately $ 2.1 billion, using the exchange rate of 109.06 Japanese Yen to each U.S. Dollar on January 16, 2019. Additionally, in the fiscal first quarter of 2019, the Company recognized a pre-tax gain recorded in Other (income) expense, net, of approximately $ 0.3 billion related to the Company's previously held equity investment in DR. CI:LABO. The Company treated this transaction as a business combination and included it in the Consumer Health segment. During the fiscal first quarter of 2020, the Company finalized the purchase price allocation. The final fair value of the acquisition was allocated primarily to amortizable intangible assets for $ 1.5 billion, goodwill for $ 1.2 billion and liabilities of $ 0.4 billion. The amortizable intangible assets were comprised of brand/trademarks and customer relationships with a weighted average life of 15.3 years. The goodwill is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise from the business acquisition and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. On April 1, 2019 the Company completed the acquisition of Auris Health, Inc. for approximately $ 3.4 billion, net of cash acquired. Additional contingent payments of up to $ 2.35 billion, in the aggregate, may be payable upon reaching certain predetermined milestones. Auris Health was a privately held developer of robotic technologies, initially focused in lung cancer, with a U.S. FDA-cleared platform currently used in bronchoscopic diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. The Company treated this transaction as a business combination and included it in the Medical Devices segment. The fair value of the acquisition was allocated primarily to amortizable and non-amortizable intangible assets, primarily IPR&D for $ 3.0 billion, goodwill for $ 2.0 billion, marketable securities of $ 0.2 billion and liabilities assumed of $ 1.8 billion, which includes the fair value of the contingent payments mentioned above. The goodwill is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise from the business acquisition and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. During the fiscal second quarter of 2020, the Company finalized the purchase price allocation. During fiscal 2020, the Company recorded Other income of approximately $ 1.1 billion for the reversal of all of the contingent consideration related to the timing of certain developmental and commercial milestones, which are not expected to be met based on the Company’s current timelines. During the fiscal third quarter of 2020, the Company recorded a partial IPR&D impairment charge of $ 0.1 billion related to timing and progression of the digital surgery platforms. In the fiscal third quarter of 2021, the Company recorded a partial IPR&D charge of $ 0.9 billion primarily related to expected development delays in the general surgery digital robotics platform (Ottava). A probability of success factor ranging from 18 % to 66 % across Ottava sub-platforms, was used in the fair value calculation to reflect inherent regulatory and commercial risk of the contingent payments and IPR&D. The discount rate applied was approximately 9.5 %. In accordance with U.S. GAAP standards related to business combinations, and goodwill and other intangible assets, supplemental pro forma information for fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019 is not provided, as the impact of the aforementioned acquisitions did not have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position. Divestitures During fiscal year 2021, in separate transactions, the Company divested two brands outside the U.S. within the Pharmaceutical segment. The Company recognized a pre-tax gain recorded in Other (income) expense, net, of approximately $ 0.6 billion. During fiscal year 2020, the Company sold 11.8 million shares of Idorsia LTD (Idorsia), or its 8.3 % ownership in the company at that time. The transaction resulted in gross proceeds of approximately CHF 337 million ($ 357 million) based on a sales price of CHF 28.55 /share and resulted in an immaterial net loss. At the end of fiscal 2020, the Company had rights to approximately 38.7 million shares through a convertible loan with a principal amount of CHF 445 million (due June 2027). During fiscal year 2021, the Company converted CHF 110 million ($ 120 million) of this loan into approximately 9.6 million shares of Idorsia which were reflected at fair value as of January 2, 2022. During the fiscal third quarter of 2021, the Company's undrawn credit facility with Idorsia was terminated. During fiscal year 2019, the Company divested its ASP business to Fortive Corporation for an aggregate value of approximately $ 2.8 billion, consisting of $ 2.7 billion of cash proceeds and $ 0.1 billion of retained net receivables. The Company recognized a pre-tax gain recorded in Other ( income) expense, net, of approximately $ 2.0 billion. 19. Legal Proceedings Johnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product liability; intellectual property; commercial; indemnification and other matters; governmental investigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of their business. Due to the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, certain trials have been rescheduled or delayed. The Company continues to monitor its legal proceedings as the situation evolves and in person trials resume. 85 The Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a liability will be incurred, and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of January 2, 2022, the Company has determined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal issue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance with ASC 450-20-25. For these and other litigation and regulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors including, among other things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and unpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements; complexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. To the extent adverse awards, judgments or verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated. In the Company’s opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with counsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company’s balance sheet, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position. However, the resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and cash flows for that period. PRODUCT LIABILITY Johnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in numerous product liability claims and lawsuits involving multiple products. Claimants in these cases seek substantial compensatory and, where available, punitive damages. While the Company believes it has substantial defenses, it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation. From time to time, even if it has substantial defenses, the Company considers isolated settlements based on a variety of circumstances. The Company has established accruals for product liability claims and lawsuits in compliance with ASC 450-20 based on currently available information, which in some cases may be limited. The Company accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to defend each matter when those costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. For certain of these matters, the Company has accrued additional amounts such as estimated costs associated with settlements, damages and other losses. Product liability accruals can represent projected product liability for thousands of claims around the world, each in different litigation environments and with different fact patterns. Changes to the accruals may be required in the future as additional information becomes available. The most significant of these cases include: the DePuy ASR™ XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR™ Hip Resurfacing System; the PINNACLE ® Acetabular Cup System; pelvic meshes; RISPERDAL ® ; XARELTO ® ; body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON'S ® Baby Powder; INVOKANA ® ; and ETHICON PHYSIOMESH ® Flexible Composite Mesh. As of January 2, 2022, in the United States there were approximately 250 plaintiffs with direct claims in pending lawsuits regarding injuries allegedly due to the DePuy ASR™ XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR™ Hip Resurfacing System; 5,300 with respect to the PINNACLE ® Acetabular Cup System; 10,100 with respect to pelvic meshes; 8,800 with respect to RISPERDAL ® ; 5,500 with respect to XARELTO ® ; 40,400 with respect to body powders containing talc; 100 with respect to INVOKANA ® ; and 4,700 with respect to ETHICON PHYSIOMESH ® Flexible Composite Mesh. The number of pending lawsuits is expected to fluctuate as certain lawsuits are settled or dismissed and additional lawsuits are filed. In August 2010, DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. (DePuy) announced a worldwide voluntary recall of its ASR ™ XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR ™ Hip Resurfacing System (ASR Hip) used in hip replacement surgery. Claims for personal injury have been made against DePuy and Johnson & Johnson. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. Litigation has also been filed in countries outside of the United States, primarily in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Ireland, Germany, India and Italy. In November 2013, DePuy reached an agreement with a Court-appointed committee of lawyers representing ASR Hip plaintiffs to establish a program to settle claims with eligible ASR Hip patients in the United States who had surgery to replace their ASR Hips, known as revision surgery, as of August 2013. DePuy reached additional agreements in February 2015 and March 2017, which further extended the settlement program to include ASR Hip patients who had revision surgeries after August 2013 and prior to February 15, 2017. This settlement program has resolved more than 10,000 claims, thereby bringing to resolution significant ASR Hip litigation activity in the United States. However, lawsuits in the United States remain, and the settlement program does not address litigation outside of the United States. In Australia, a class action settlement was reached that resolved the claims of the majority of ASR Hip patients in that country. In Canada, the Company has reached agreements to settle the class actions filed in that country . The Company continues to receive information with respect to potential additional 86 costs associated with this recall on a worldwide basis. The Company has established accruals for the costs associated with the United States settlement program and ASR Hip-related product liability litigation. Claims for personal injury have also been made against DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. and Johnson & Johnson (collectively, DePuy) relating to the PINNACLE ® Acetabular Cup System used in hip replacement surgery. Product liability lawsuits continue to be filed, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas. Litigation also has been filed in some state courts and in countries outside of the United States. Several adverse verdicts have been rendered against DePuy, one of which was reversed on appeal and remanded for retrial. During the first quarter of 2019, DePuy established a United States settlement program to resolve these cases. As part of the settlement program, adverse verdicts have been settled. The Company has established an accrual for product liability litigation associated with the PINNACLE ® Acetabular Cup System and the related settlement program. Claims for personal injury have been made against Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon) and Johnson & Johnson arising out of Ethicon’s pelvic mesh devices used to treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. The Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and additional cases. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States had been organized as a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia. In March 2021, the MDL Court entered an order closing the MDL. The MDL Court has remanded cases for trial to the jurisdictions where the case was originally filed and additional pelvic mesh lawsuits have been filed, and remain, outside of the MDL. The Company has settled or otherwise resolved the majority of the United States cases and the estimated costs associated with these settlements and the remaining cases are reflected in the Company’s accruals. In addition, class actions and individual personal injury cases or claims seeking damages for alleged injury resulting from Ethicon’s pelvic mesh devices have been commenced in various countries outside of the United States, including claims and cases in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and class actions in Israel, Australia and Canada. In November 2019, the Federal Court of Australia issued a judgment regarding its findings with respect to liability in relation to the three Lead Applicants and generally in relation to the design, manufacture, pre and post-market assessments and testing, and supply and promotion of the devices in Australia used to treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. In March 2020, the Court issued a decision and entered damages awards to the three Lead Applicants. The Company appealed the decision to the intermediate appellate court, the Full Court. The appeal was heard in February 2021 and, in March 2021, the Full Court entered a judgment dismissing the appeal. An application for special leave to the High Court of Australia was filed in April 2021, and the High Court heard oral argument on the application in November 2021. Special leave was refused. While this brings an end to the appellate process, there will now be an individual case assessment process for the remaining group member claims. The parties currently are in discussions with the Court to determine the form and mechanism of that individual case assessment process. The next hearing is scheduled for late February 2022. The class actions in Canada were discontinued in 2020 as a result of a settlement of a group of cases and an agreement to resolve the Israeli class action was reached in May 2021. The parties in the Israeli class action are currently negotiating the wording and some of the terms thereof and once finalized, the settlement will be subject to court approval. The parties are due to update the court on the status of the finalization of the settlement negotiations by the end of February 2022. The Company has established accruals with respect to product liability litigation associated with Ethicon’s pelvic mesh products. Following a June 2016 worldwide market withdrawal of ETHICON PHYSIOMESH ® Flexible Composite Mesh (Physiomesh), claims for personal injury have been made against Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon) and Johnson & Johnson alleging personal injury arising out of the use of this hernia mesh device. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. A multi-county litigation (MCL) also has been formed in New Jersey state court and assigned to Atlantic County for cases pending in New Jersey. In addition to the matters in the MDL and MCL, there are additional lawsuits pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, which are part of the MDL for polypropylene mesh devices manufactured by C.R. Bard, Inc., one multi-plaintiff lawsuit pending in Oklahoma state court and lawsuits pending outside the United States. In May 2021, Ethicon and lead counsel for the plaintiffs entered into a term sheet to resolve approximately 3,600 Physiomesh cases (covering approximately 4,300 plaintiffs) pending in the MDL and MCL at that time. A master settlement agreement (MSA) was entered into in September 2021 and includes 3,729 cases in the MDL and MCL. All deadlines and trial settings in those proceedings are currently stayed pending the completion of the settlement agreement. The deadline for issuance of Individual Allocation amounts by the Special Master is March 2022. The costs associated with this proposed settlement are reflected in the Company’s accruals. Post-Settlement cases in the Physiomesh MDL and MCL are subject to docket control orders requiring early expert reports and discovery requirements. As of February 2022, there are approximately 90 active cases subject to these orders which are being reviewed and evaluated. Claims have also been filed against Ethicon and Johnson & Johnson alleging personal injuries arising from the PROCEED ® Mesh and PROCEED ® Ventral Patch hernia mesh products. In March 2019, the New Jersey Supreme Court entered an order consolidating these cases pending in New Jersey as an MCL in Atlantic County Superior Court. Additional cases have been filed in various federal and state courts in the United States, and in jurisdictions outside the United States. Discovery is underway in the MCL proceedings. 87 Ethicon and Johnson & Johnson also have been subject to claims for personal injuries arising from the PROLENE™ Polypropylene Hernia System. In January 2020, the New Jersey Supreme Court created an MCL in Atlantic County Superior Court to handle such cases. Cases involving this product have also been filed in other federal and state courts in the United States. The Company has established accruals with respect to product liability litigation associated with ETHICON PHYSIOMESH ® Flexible Composite Mesh, PROCEED ® Mesh and PROCEED ® Ventral Patch, and PROLENE™ Polypropylene Hernia System products. Claims for personal injury have been made against Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Johnson & Johnson arising out of the use of RISPERDAL ® , and related compounds, indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia, acute manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder and irritability associated with autism. Lawsuits primarily have been filed in state courts in Pennsylvania, California, and Missouri. Other actions are pending in various courts in the United States and Canada. Product liability lawsuits continue to be filed, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. The Company has successfully defended a number of these cases but there have been verdicts against the Company, including a verdict in October 2019 of $ 8.0 billion of punitive damages related to one plaintiff, which the trial judge reduced to $ 6.8 million in January 2020. In September 2021, the Company entered into a settlement in principle with the counsel representing plaintiffs in this matter and in substantially all of the outstanding cases in the United States. The costs associated with this and other settlements are reflected in the Company’s accruals. Claims for personal injury arising out of the use of XARELTO ® , an oral anticoagulant, have been made against Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI); Johnson & Johnson; and JPI’s collaboration partner for XARELTO ® , Bayer Healthcare AG, and certain of its affiliates. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. In addition, cases have been filed in state courts across the United States. Many of these cases were consolidated into a state mass tort litigation in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and in a coordinated proceeding in Los Angeles, California. Class action lawsuits also have been filed in Canada. In March 2019, JPI and Johnson & Johnson announced an agreement in principle to settle the XARELTO ® cases in the United States; the settlement agreement was executed in May 2019, the settlement became final in December 2019, and the settlement was funded in January 2020. This resolved the majority of cases pending in the United States. The Company has established accruals for its costs associated with the United States settlement program and XARELTO ® related product liability litigation. A significant number of personal injury claims alleging that talc causes cancer were made against Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. and Johnson & Johnson arising out of the use of body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S ® Baby Powder. The number of these personal injury lawsuits, filed in state and federal courts in the United States as well as outside of the United States, continued to increase through fiscal year 2021. In talc cases that previously have gone to trial, the Company has obtained a number of defense verdicts, but there also have been verdicts against the Company, many of which have been reversed on appeal. In June 2020, the Missouri Court of Appeals reversed in part and affirmed in part a July 2018 verdict of $ 4.7 billion in Ingham v. Johnson & Johnson, et al., No. ED 207476 (Mo. App.), reducing the overall award to $ 2.1 billion. An application for transfer of the case to the Missouri Supreme Court was subsequently denied and in June 2021, a petition for certiorari, seeking a review of the Ingham decision by the United States Supreme Court, was denied. In June 2021, the Company paid the award, which, including interest, totaled approximately $ 2.5 billion. The facts and circumstances, including the terms of the award, were unique to the Ingham decision and not representative of other claims brought against the Company. The Company continues to believe that it has strong legal grounds to contest the other talc verdicts that it has appealed. Notwithstanding the Company’s confidence in the safety of its talc products, in certain circumstances the Company has settled cases. In October 2021, Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. (Old JJCI) implemented a corporate restructuring (the 2021 Corporate Restructuring). As a result of that restructuring, Old JJCI ceased to exist and three new entities were created: (a) LTL Management LLC, a North Carolina limited liability company (LTL or Debtor); (b) Royalty A&M LLC, a North Carolina limited liability company and a direct subsidiary of LTL (RAM); and (c) the Debtor’s direct parent, Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc., a New Jersey company (New JJCI). The Debtor received certain of Old JJCI’s assets and became solely responsible for the talc-related liabilities of Old JJCI, including all liabilities related in any way to injury or damage, or alleged injury or damage, sustained or incurred in the purchase or use of, or exposure to, talc, including talc contained in any product, or to the risk of, or responsibility for, any such damage or injury, except for any liabilities for which the exclusive remedy is provided under a workers’ compensation statute or act (the Talc-Related Liabilities). In October 2021, notwithstanding the Company’s confidence in the safety of its talc products, the Debtor filed a voluntary petition with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of North Carolina, Charlotte Division, seeking relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the LTL Bankruptcy Case). As a result of the LTL Bankruptcy Case, the Court entered a temporary restraining order staying all litigation against LTL and Old JJCI. On November 15, 2021, the North 88 Carolina Bankruptcy Court confirmed the scope of the stay, issuing a Preliminary Injunction (PI) prohibiting and enjoining the commencement and prosecution of talc-related claims against LTL, Old JJCI, New JJCI, Johnson & Johnson, other of their corporate affiliates, identified retailers, insurance companies, and certain other parties. The LTL Bankruptcy Case was transferred to the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey in November 2021, and that court subsequently extended the PI through the end of February 2022. Claimants have filed a motion to dismiss the LTL Bankruptcy Case. The court commenced a hearing on February 14, 2022 regarding the motion to dismiss and on whether the PI should be extended. While the PI effectively stays all of the Company’s talc-related personal injury litigation, LTL has agreed to lift the automatic stay on a small number of appeals where appeal bonds have been filed. The Company has agreed to provide funding to LTL for the payment of amounts the Bankruptcy Court determines are owed by LTL through the establishment of a $ 2 billion trust in furtherance of this purpose. The Company has established a reserve for approximately $ 2 billion in connection with the aforementioned trust. Subsequent to the fiscal third quarter of 2021, the Company de-consolidated LTL, which is a related party, as a result of the bankruptcy filing. The impact of the de-consolidation is not material to the Company. The parties have not yet been able to reach a resolution of all matters related to talc, and while certain amounts under various scenarios have recently been referred to in testimony as part of the LTL bankruptcy proceedings, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amount accrued. In February 2019, the Company’s talc supplier, Imerys Talc America, Inc. and two of its affiliates, Imerys Talc Vermont, Inc. and Imerys Talc Canada, Inc. (collectively, Imerys) filed a voluntary petition under chapter 11 of the United States Code (the Bankruptcy Code) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (Imerys Bankruptcy). The Imerys Bankruptcy relates to Imerys’s potential liability for personal injury from exposure to talcum powder sold by Imerys (Talc Claims). In its bankruptcy, Imerys alleges it has claims against the Company for indemnification and rights to joint insurance proceeds. In May 2020, Imerys, its parent Imerys S.A., the Tort Claimants’ Committee (TCC), and the Future Claimants’ Representative (FCR) (collectively, the Plan Proponents) filed their Plan of Reorganization (the Plan) and the Disclosure Statement related thereto. The Plan Proponents have since filed numerous amendments to the Plan and Disclosure Statement. A hearing on the Plan Proponent’s Disclosure Statement was held in January 2021, and the Court entered an order approving the Disclosure Statement, allowing Imerys to proceed with soliciting votes on the Plan. In March 2021, the Company voted to reject the Plan and opted out of the consensual releases in the Plan. In April 2021, the Plan Proponents announced the Plan had received the requisite number of accepting votes to confirm the Plan. The Company challenged certain improprieties with respect to portions of the vote and sought to disqualify those votes. In October 2021, the Bankruptcy Court issued a ruling deeming thousands of votes as withdrawn as improperly voted. In October 2021, Imerys cancelled the confirmation hearing on the Plan. Imerys, the TCC, the FCR, and certain of Imerys’s insurers (the Mediation Parties) have since agreed to engage in mediation. In July 2021, Imerys commenced an adversary proceeding against the Company in the Imerys Bankruptcy (the Imerys adversary proceeding). The Imerys adversary proceeding sought, among other things, certain declarations with respect to the indemnification obligations allegedly owed by the Company to Imerys. The TCC and FCR simultaneously filed a motion for temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin the Company from undergoing a corporate restructuring that would separate the Company’s talc liabilities from its other assets. The Bankruptcy Court denied the motion. The Company thereafter filed a motion to dismiss the adversary proceeding. The Bankruptcy Court has not yet decided the motion to dismiss. In October 2021, the Company filed a Notice of Bankruptcy Filing and Stay of Proceedings clarifying that the automatic stay arising upon the filing of the LTL Bankruptcy Case should apply to the Imerys adversary proceeding. In June 2020, Cyprus Mines Corporation and its parent (together, Cyprus), which had owned certain Imerys talc mines, filed an adversary proceeding against the Company and Imerys in the Imerys Bankruptcy seeking a declaration of indemnity rights under certain contractual agreements (the Cyprus adversary proceeding). The Company denies such indemnification is owed, and filed a motion to dismiss the adversary complaint. In February 2021, Cyprus filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code and filed its Disclosure Statement and Plan. The Plan contemplates a settlement with Imerys and talc claimants where Cyprus would make a monetary contribution to a trust established under the Imerys Plan in exchange for an injunction against Talc Claims asserted against it. Cyprus has not yet sought approval of its Disclosure Statement and Plan. Cyprus, along with the TCC and FCR appointed in the Cyprus chapter 11 case, have agreed to participate in the mediation with the Mediation Parties. In October 2021, the Company filed a Notice of Bankruptcy Filing and Stay of Proceedings clarifying that the automatic stay arising upon the filing of the LTL Bankruptcy Case should apply to the Cyprus adversary proceeding. In February 2021, several of the Company’s insurers involved in coverage litigation in New Jersey State Court (the Coverage Action) filed a motion in the Imerys Bankruptcy Court proceeding seeking a determination that the automatic stay does not apply to the Coverage Action and, in the alternative, seeking relief from the automatic stay to allow them to continue to litigate their claims in the Coverage Action. In March 2021, the Company filed a limited response and reservation of rights with respect to the motion. The Court entered an agreed order modifying the stay to allow the litigation in the Coverage Action to continue. In October 2021, LTL filed a Notice of Bankruptcy Filing and Stay of Proceedings clarifying that the automatic stay arising upon the filing of the LTL Bankruptcy Case should apply to the Coverage Action. 89 In February 2018, a securities class action lawsuit was filed against Johnson & Johnson and certain named officers in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging that Johnson & Johnson violated the federal securities laws by failing to disclose alleged asbestos contamination in body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S ® Baby Powder, and that purchasers of Johnson & Johnson’s shares suffered losses as a result. Plaintiff is seeking damages. In April 2019, the Company moved to dismiss the complaint and briefing on the motion was complete as of August 2019. In December 2019, the Court denied, in part, the motion to dismiss. In March 2020, the Company answered the complaint. In April 2021, briefing on Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification was completed. In July 2021, the Company filed a notice of supplemental authority in opposition to Plaintiff’s motion for class certification, and Plaintiff filed a response. In December 2021, the Company filed a motion to supplement the class certification record, and in January 2022, Plaintiff responded. Discovery is ongoing. In June 2019, a shareholder filed a complaint initiating a summary proceeding in New Jersey state court for a books and records inspection. In August 2019, Johnson & Johnson responded to the books and records complaint and filed a cross motion to dismiss. In September 2019, Plaintiff replied and the Court heard oral argument. In February 2022, the Court granted Johnson & Johnson's cross motion to dismiss. In October 2019, December 2019, and January 2020, four shareholders filed four separate derivative lawsuits against Johnson & Johnson as the nominal defendant and its current directors and certain officers as defendants in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging a breach of fiduciary duties related to the alleged asbestos contamination in body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S ® Baby Powder, and that Johnson & Johnson has suffered damages as a result of those alleged breaches. In February 2020, the four cases were consolidated into a single action under the caption In re Johnson & Johnson Talc Stockholder Derivative Litigation . In July 2020, a report was delivered to the Company’s Board of Directors by independent counsel retained by the Board to investigate the allegations in the derivative lawsuits and in a series of shareholder letters that the Board received raising similar issues and demanding that suit be brought against certain Directors. Four of the shareholders who sent demands are plaintiffs in th e In re Johnson & Johnson Talc Stockholder Derivative Litigation . The independent counsel recommended that the Company reject the shareholder demands and take the steps that are necessary or appropriate to secure dismissal of the derivative lawsuits. The Board unanimously adopted the recommendations of the independent counsel’s report. In October 2020, the shareholders filed a consolidated complaint, and in January 2021, Johnson & Johnson moved to dismiss the consolidated complaint. In March 2021, Plaintiffs filed a motion for discovery. The Court temporarily terminated Johnson & Johnson’s motion to dismiss pending a decision on Plaintiff’s motion for discovery. In November 2021, at the Court’s request, the parties submitted supplemental briefing on Plaintiff’s motion for discovery. In January 2019, two ERISA class action lawsuits were filed by participants in the Johnson & Johnson Savings Plan against Johnson & Johnson, its Pension and Benefits Committee, and certain named officers in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by offering Johnson & Johnson stock as a Johnson & Johnson Savings Plan investment option when it was imprudent to do so because of failures to disclose alleged asbestos contamination in body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S ® Baby Powder. Plaintiffs are seeking damages and injunctive relief. In September 2019, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss. In April 2020, the Court granted Defendants’ motion but granted leave to amend. In June 2020, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, and in July 2020, Defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint. As of October 2020, briefing on Defendants’ motion was complete. In February 2021, the Court granted Defendants’ motion, and granted Plaintiffs leave to amend. In April 2021, Plaintiffs informed the Court that they did not intend to file an amended complaint, and the Court dismissed the case with prejudice. In May 2021, Plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal with the Third Circuit. In July 2021, Plaintiffs filed their opening brief in the Third Circuit and in September 2021, Defendants filed their response brief, and in October 2021, Plaintiffs filed their reply brief. In January 2022, the Third Circuit heard oral argument. A lawsuit was brought against the Company in the Superior Court of California for the County of San Diego alleging violations of California’s Consumer Legal Remedies Act (CLRA) relating to JOHNSON’S ® Baby Powder. In that lawsuit, the plaintiffs allege that Johnson & Johnson violated the CLRA by failing to provide required Proposition 65 warnings. In July 2019, the Company filed a notice of removal to the United States District Court for the Southern District of California and plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint shortly thereafter.

The Company has produced documents and responded to inquiries, and will continue to cooperate with government inquiries. Claims for personal injury have been made against a number of Johnson & Johnson companies, including Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Johnson & Johnson, arising out of the use of INVOKANA ® , a prescription medication indicated to improve glycemic control in adults with Type 2 diabetes. In December 2016, lawsuits filed in federal courts in the United States were organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. Cases have also been filed in state courts. Class action lawsuits have been filed in Canada. Product liability lawsuits continue to be filed, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. The Company has settled or otherwise resolved many of the cases and claims in the United States and the costs associated with these settlements are reflected in the Company’s accruals. Claims for personal injury have been made against a number of Johnson & Johnson companies, including Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Johnson & Johnson, arising out of the use of ELMIRON ® , a prescription medication indicated for the relief of bladder pain or discomfort associated with interstitial cystitis. These lawsuits, which allege that ELMIRON ® contributes to the development of permanent retinal injury and vision loss, have been filed in both state and federal courts across the United States. In December 2020, lawsuits filed in federal courts in the United States, including putative class action cases seeking medical monitoring, were organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey.

Product liability lawsuits continue to be filed, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. The Company has established accruals for defense costs associated with ELMIRON ® related product liability litigation. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY Certain subsidiaries of Johnson & Johnson are subject, from time to time, to legal proceedings and claims related to patent, trademark and other intellectual property matters arising out of their businesses. Many of these matters involve challenges to the coverage and/or validity of the patents on various products and allegations that certain of the Company’s products infringe the patents of third parties. Although these subsidiaries believe that they have substantial defenses to these challenges and allegations with respect to all significant patents, there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these matters. A loss in any of these cases could adversely affect the ability of these subsidiaries to sell their products, result in loss of sales due to loss of market exclusivity, require the payment of past damages and future royalties, and may result in a non-cash impairment charge for any associated intangible asset. Significant matters are described below. Medical Devices In December 2016, Dr. Ford Albritton sued Acclarent, Inc. (Acclarent) in United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas alleging that Acclarent’s RELIEVA ® Spin and RELIEVEA SpinPlus ® products infringe U.S. Patent No. 9,011,412. Dr. Albritton also alleges breach of contract, fraud and that he is the true owner of Acclarent’s U.S. Patent No. 8,414,473. Trial began in October 2021, and shortly thereafter, the parties reached an agreement to settle the case. Plaintiff’s motion to dismiss with prejudice was filed in October 2021. The case was dismissed with prejudice in November 2021. In August 2018, Intuitive Surgical, Inc. and Intuitive Surgical Operations, Inc. (collectively, Intuitive) filed a patent infringement suit against Auris Health, Inc. (Auris) in United States District Court for the District of Delaware.

Auris filed IPR Petitions with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) regarding the ’200, ’056, ’601 ’701, ’447, ’276 and ’906 patents. Intuitive subsequently dropped the ’200, ’473 and ’701 patents from the suit. In December 2019, the USPTO instituted review of the ’601 patent and denied review of the ’056 patent. In February and March 2020, the USPTO instituted review of the ’200, ’447, ’701 and ’906 patents and denied review of the ’276 patent. In December 2020, the USPTO declared all of the challenged claims in the ’601 patent to be invalid. Intuitive has appealed that decision. In March 2021, the USPTO ruled that the challenged claims of the ’447 and ’906 patents are not invalid. Auris has appealed that decision. Auris filed a request for reexamination of the ’276 patent in November 2021, and in January 2022, the USPTO granted the reexamination request. Trial is scheduled to begin in January 2023.

In October 2021, the case was settled and dismissed. In October 2020, Rasmussen Instruments, LLC (Rasmussen) filed a patent infringement suit against DePuy Synthes Products, Inc., DePuy Synthes Sales, Inc. and Medical Device Business Services, Inc.

Pharmaceutical Litigation Against Filers of Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) The following summarizes lawsuits the Company’s subsidiaries have brought against generic companies that have filed ANDAs with the U.S. FDA or undertaken similar regulatory processes outside of the United States, seeking to market generic forms of products sold by various subsidiaries of Johnson & Johnson prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. These ANDAs typically include allegations of non-infringement and invalidity of the applicable patents. In the event the Company’s subsidiaries are not successful in an action, or the automatic statutory stay of the ANDAs expires before the United States District Court rulings are obtained, the generic companies involved would have the ability, upon approval of the U.S. FDA, to introduce generic versions of their products to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for the applicable products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. In addition, from time to time, the Company’s subsidiaries may settle these types of actions and such settlements can involve the introduction of generic versions of the products at issue to the market prior to the expiration of the relevant patents. The Inter Partes Review (IPR) process with the USPTO, created under the 2011 America Invents Act, is also being used at times by generic companies in conjunction with ANDAs and lawsuits, to challenge the applicable patents. ZYTIGA ® Beginning in January 2019, Janssen Inc. and Janssen Oncology, Inc. (collectively, Janssen) initiated Statements of Claim under Section 6 of the Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations in Canada against Apotex Inc. (Apotex), Pharmascience Inc.

(collectively, DRL) in response to those parties’ filing of Abbreviated New Drug Submissions (ANDS) seeking approval to market generic versions of ZYTIGA ® before the expiration of the Canadian Patent No. 2,661,422 (’422). The trial in these actions concluded in November 2020, and the Court issued a decision holding the ’422 patent invalid in January 2021. In February 2021, Janssen appealed the decision.

In December 2021, the MDL panel granted the motion. No trial date has been set in this lawsuit. In each of these lawsuits, JPI and Bayer are seeking an order enjoining defendants from marketing their generic version of XARELTO ® before the expiration of the ’310 patent.

GOVERNMENT PROCEEDINGS Like other companies in the pharmaceutical, consumer health and medical devices industries, Johnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation by national, state and local government agencies in the United States and other countries in which they operate. Such regulation has been the basis of government investigations and litigations. The most significant litigation brought by, and investigations conducted by, government agencies are listed below. It is possible that criminal charges and substantial fines and/or civil penalties or damages could result from government investigations or litigation. Average Wholesale Price (AWP) Litigation Johnson & Johnson and several of its pharmaceutical subsidiaries (the J&J AWP Defendants), along with numerous other pharmaceutical companies, were named as defendants in a series of lawsuits in state and federal courts involving allegations that the pricing and marketing of certain pharmaceutical products amounted to fraudulent and otherwise actionable conduct because, among other things, the companies allegedly reported an inflated Average Wholesale Price (AWP) for the drugs at issue. Payors alleged that they used those AWPs in calculating provider reimbursement levels. The plaintiffs in these cases included three classes of private persons or entities that paid for any portion of the purchase of the drugs at issue based on 95 AWP, and state government entities that made Medicaid payments for the drugs at issue based on AWP. Many of these cases, both federal actions and state actions removed to federal court, were consolidated for pre-trial purposes in a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, where all claims against the J&J AWP Defendants were ultimately dismissed. The J&J AWP Defendants also prevailed in a case brought by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Other AWP cases have been resolved through court order or settlement. The case brought by Illinois was settled after trial. In New Jersey, a putative class action based upon AWP allegations is pending against Centocor, Inc. and Ortho Biotech Inc. (both now Janssen Biotech, Inc.), Johnson & Johnson and ALZA Corporation. All other cases have been resolved. Opioid Litigation Beginning in 2014 and continuing to the present, Johnson & Johnson and Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI), along with other pharmaceutical companies, have been named in approximately 3,400 lawsuits related to the marketing of opioids, including DURAGESIC ® , NUCYNTA ® and NUCYNTA ® ER. The suits also raise allegations related to previously owned active pharmaceutical ingredient supplier subsidiaries, Tasmanian Alkaloids Pty, Ltd. and Noramco, Inc. (both subsidiaries were divested in 2016). The majority of the cases have been filed by state and local governments. Similar lawsuits have also been filed by private plaintiffs and organizations, including but not limited to the following: individual plaintiffs on behalf of children suffering from Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome; hospitals; and health insurers/payors. To date, complaints against pharmaceutical manufacturers, including Johnson & Johnson and JPI, have been filed by the state Attorneys General in Arkansas, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, Washington and West Virginia. Complaints against the manufacturers also have been filed in state or federal court by city, county and local government agencies in the following states: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. The Government of Puerto Rico filed suit in Superior Court of San Juan. There are over 380 cases pending in various state courts. There are close to 3,000 federal cases coordinated in a federal Multi-District Litigation (MDL) pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. In addition, the Province of British Columbia filed suit against Johnson & Johnson and its Canadian affiliate Janssen Inc., and many other industry members, in Canada, and is seeking to have that action certified as an opt in class action on behalf of other provincial/territorial and the federal governments in Canada. Additional proposed class actions have been filed in Canada against Johnson & Johnson and Janssen Inc., and many other industry members, by and on behalf of people who used opioids (for personal injuries), municipalities and First Nations bands. In October 2019, an antitrust complaint was filed by private plaintiffs in federal court in Tennessee and is pending transfer to the MDL. These actions allege a variety of claims related to opioid marketing practices, including false advertising, unfair competition, public nuisance, consumer fraud violations, deceptive acts and practices, false claims and unjust enrichment. The suits generally seek penalties and/or injunctive and monetary relief and, in some of the suits, the plaintiffs are seeking joint and several liability among the defendants. An adverse judgment in any of these lawsuits could result in the imposition of large monetary penalties and significant damages including, punitive damages, cost of abatement, substantial fines, equitable remedies and other sanctions. In 2019, the trial in the matter filed by the Oklahoma Attorney General resulted in a judgment against Johnson & Johnson and JPI in the amount of $ 465 million. Johnson & Johnson and JPI appealed the judgment, and in November 2021, the Oklahoma Supreme Court reversed the trial court’s judgment. In October 2019 Johnson & Johnson and JPI announced a settlement of the first case set for trial in the MDL with two counties in Ohio. In April 2021, three California counties and the City of Oakland commenced a trial in California state court against Johnson & Johnson and JPI, and other affiliates, as well as three other pharmaceutical manufacturers. The trial concluded in October 2021, and in December 2021, the Court entered a final trial judgment in favor of Defendants on all claims. In February 2022, Plaintiffs' motion to set aside and vacate the judgment was denied. In August 2019, Johnson & Johnson received a grand jury subpoena from the United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York for documents related to the Company’s anti-diversion policies and procedures and distribution of its opioid medications, in what the Company understands to be part of a broader investigation into manufacturers’ and distributors’ monitoring programs and reporting under the Controlled Substances Act. In September 2019, Johnson & Johnson received subpoenas from the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) as part of an industry-wide inquiry into the effect of opioid prescriptions on New York health insurance premiums. In September 2020, the Company learned that NYDFS filed a statement of charges related to this investigation. In June 2021, the Company and JPI announced a settlement agreement with the State of New York and its participating subdivisions, including Nassau County and Suffolk County, resolving their opioid-related claims against the Company on terms consistent with the Company’s previously announced agreement in principle to contribute up to $ 5 billion to all-in settlement of opioid-related claims by states, cities, counties, and tribal governments. The settlement provides New York and its participating subdivisions with up to $ 263 million to address opioid-related issues, reimburses attorney fees and costs, and removes the 96 Company and Janssen from a multi-defendant trial of opioid-related claims that commenced in Suffolk County in June 2021. In exchange, the Company and JPI receive releases from the claims asserted by New York and the participating parties, including NYDFS. In October 2021, the Company and JPI announced a settlement agreement with the State of Texas and its participating subdivisions, including Dallas County, Bexar County, and Tarrant County, resolving their opioid-related claims against the Company on terms consistent with the Company’s previously announced agreement to contribute up to $ 5 billion to all-in settlement of opioid-related claims by states, cities, counties, and tribal governments. The settlement provides Texas and its participating subdivisions with up to $ 297 million to address opioid-related issues and reimburse attorney fees and costs, and removes the Company and Janssen from multi-defendant bellwether trials of opioid-related claims scheduled to commence in Texas state courts in early 2022. In exchange, the Company and JPI will receive releases from the claims asserted by Texas and the participating subdivisions. Johnson & Johnson, JPI and other pharmaceutical companies have also received subpoenas or requests for information related to opioids marketing practices from the following state Attorneys General: Alaska, Indiana, Montana, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Washington. In September 2017, Johnson & Johnson and JPI were contacted by the Texas and Colorado Attorney General’s Offices on behalf of approximately 38 states regarding a multi-state Attorney General investigation. In October 2019, the Company announced a proposed agreement in principle that would include the Company paying $ 4 billion as settlement of these matters. In October 2020, the Company agreed to contribute up to an additional $ 1 billion to an all-in settlement amount that would resolve opioid lawsuits filed and future claims by states, cities, counties and tribal governments, for a total of $ 5 billion which has been accrued, subject to various conditions and an agreement being finalized. This agreement in principle is not an admission of liability or wrong-doing. In July 2021, the Company announced that the terms of the agreement to settle the state and subdivision claims have been finalized and up to one-third of the all-in settlement is expected to be paid within the next 12 months, depending upon the level of participation by the states and their subdivisions. The terms provide a period of time for states to elect to participate in the agreement and, thereafter, a period for the subdivisions of the participating states to opt-in. As of January 2022, 45 states, five territories, and the District of Columbia had elected to participate in the settlement. The subdivision opt-in period expired in January 2022. The Company retains the right to opt-out of the agreement until late February 2022 if, in its sole discretion, there is insufficient participation. Based on expected participation, the Company has committed in advance to proceed with the settlement in five of the participating states (New York, Texas, Florida, Nevada, and New Mexico) and with tribal governments, whose cases were scheduled for trial in 2021, 2022, or 2023. From June 2017 through December 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors received a series of shareholder demand letters alleging breaches of fiduciary duties related to the marketing of opioids. The Board retained independent counsel to investigate the allegations in the demands, and in April 2020, independent counsel delivered a report to the Board recommending that the Company reject the shareholder demands and take the steps that are necessary or appropriate to secure dismissal of related derivative litigation. The Board unanimously adopted the recommendations of the independent counsel’s report. In November 2019, one of the shareholders who sent a demand filed a derivative complaint against Johnson & Johnson as the nominal defendant and certain current and former directors and officers as defendants in the Superior Court of New Jersey. The complaint alleges breaches of fiduciary duties related to the marketing of opioids, and that Johnson & Johnson has suffered damages as a result of those alleged breaches. In May 2020, the shareholder filed an amended complaint challenging the Board’s rejection of his demand. In August 2020, Johnson & Johnson moved to dismiss the amended complaint. In February 2021, the Court held oral argument on Johnson & Johnson’s motion. In February 2022, the Court granted Johnson & Johnson’s motion to dismiss the amended complaint. In August 2020, another shareholder who sent a demand filed a separate derivative complaint in the same court making similar allegations. In October 2020, the Court granted defendants’ request to reassign the second-filed case to the division where the first-filed case is pending. In December 2019, two additional shareholders who sent demands filed two separate derivative complaints making similar allegations against Johnson & Johnson as the nominal defendant and certain current and former directors and officers as defendants in the United States District for the District of New Jersey. In April 2020, the two federal cases were consolidated into a single action captioned In re Johnson & Johnson Opioid Stockholder Derivative Litigation . In July 2020, the shareholders filed a consolidated complaint. In September 2020, Johnson & Johnson moved to dismiss the consolidated complaint, and in December 2020, the shareholders opposed Johnson & Johnson’s motion. Johnson & Johnson filed its reply in February 2021. In July 2020, an additional shareholder who sent a demand filed a derivative complaint in the same federal court making similar allegations against the same defendants named in the consolidated action. In January 2021, pursuant to an order in the consolidated action, the third case was consolidated into the consolidated action. In February 2021, the Court granted the shareholders motion to voluntarily dismiss the consolidated action without prejudice, and the shareholders’ counsel then filed a notice of association in the first-filed derivative action pending in the Superior Court of New Jersey. 97 Other In August 2012, DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc., DePuy, Inc. (now known as DePuy Synthes, Inc.), and Johnson & Johnson Services, Inc. (collectively DePuy) received an informal request from the United States Attorney’s Office for the District of Massachusetts and the Civil Division of the United States Department of Justice (the United States) for the production of materials relating to the DePuy ASR™ XL Hip device. In July 2014, the United States notified the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts that it had declined to intervene in a qui tam case filed pursuant to the False Claims Act against the companies concerning the hip devices. In February 2016, the District Court granted the companies’ motion to dismiss with prejudice, unsealed the qui tam complaint, and denied the qui tam relators’ request for leave to file a further amended complaint. The qui tam relators appealed the case to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. In July 2017, the First Circuit affirmed the District Court’s dismissal in part, reversed in part, and affirmed the decision to deny the relators’ request to file a third amended complaint. In March 2021, DePuy filed its motion to strike and dismiss the relators’ second amended complaint; the District Court denied DePuy’s motion to strike and dismiss in July 2021. DePuy filed a motion for reconsideration of the District Court’s July 2021 ruling. In November 2021, the District Court granted DePuy’s motion for reconsideration and dismissed the case with prejudice. The District Court’s order was unsealed in December 2021. The Relators filed several post-dismissal motions, including a January 2022 omnibus motion for reconsideration. Following the District Court’s order dismissing the case with prejudice, DePuy filed a December 2021 motion seeking the recovery of attorneys’ fees. In October 2012, Johnson & Johnson was contacted by the California Attorney General’s office regarding a multi-state Attorney General investigation of the marketing of surgical mesh products for hernia and urogynecological purposes by Johnson & Johnson’s subsidiary, Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon). In May 2016, California and Washington filed civil complaints against Johnson & Johnson, Ethicon and Ethicon US, LLC alleging violations of their consumer protection statutes.

In June 2014, the Mississippi Attorney General filed a complaint in Chancery Court of The First Judicial District of Hinds County, Mississippi against Johnson & Johnson and Johnson & Johnson Consumer Companies, Inc. (now known as Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc.) (collectively, JJCI). The complaint alleges that JJCI violated the Mississippi Consumer Protection Act by failing to disclose alleged health risks associated with female consumers’ use of talc contained in JOHNSON’S ® Baby Powder and JOHNSON’S ® Shower to Shower (a product divested in 2012) and seeks injunctive and monetary relief. Johnson & Johnson and JJCI moved for summary judgment on the grounds that the State’s claim was barred by preemption, which the trial court denied. The Mississippi Supreme Court granted Johnson & Johnson and JJCI’s request to file an interlocutory appeal of the denial of the motion for summary judgment in late 2019. Briefing and oral argument were completed. Thereafter, the Court rejected the interlocutory appeal in April 2021 and remanded the matter to the trial court. Thereafter, the State moved for a trial setting. JJCI objected to any trial setting due to the LTL Bankruptcy and that any decision on whether the stay applied should be deferred to the LTL Bankruptcy court. The State opposed any stay and argued that the trial court should decide issues concerning the stay. The motion for trial setting and JJCI’s objections were heard in November 2021 and in January 2022, the Court granted plaintiff’s motion for trial setting and directed the parties to consult with the Court administrator to secure a trial date. That process is underway. In August 2021, JJCI filed a Petition for Writ of Certiorari in the United States Supreme Court as to the Mississippi Supreme Court’s ruling of April 2021, the State responded to the Petition for Writ of Certiorari in November 2021, the JJCI filed a reply in November 2021, and the United States Supreme Court denied the Petition for Writ of Certiorari in December 2021.

Restructuring In the fiscal second quarter of 2018, the Company announced plans to implement a series of actions across its Global Supply Chain that are intended to focus resources and increase investments in the critical capabilities, technologies and solutions necessary to manufacture and supply its product portfolio, enhance agility and drive growth. The Global Supply Chain actions include expanding the use of strategic collaborations and bolstering initiatives to reduce complexity, improve cost-competitiveness, enhance capabilities and optimize the Supply Chain network. In fiscal year 2021, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $ 0.5 billion, which is included on the following lines of the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, $ 0.3 billion in restructuring, $ 0.1 billion in other (income) expense and $ 0.1 billion in cost of products sold. Total project costs of approximately $ 1.8 billion have been recorded since the restructuring was announced. See the following table for additional details on the restructuring program. In total, the Company expects the Global Supply Chain actions to generate approximately $ 0.6 billion to $ 0.8 billion in annual pre-tax cost savings that will be substantially delivered by the end of 2022. The program is set to be completed at the end of 2022. The Company expects to record pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $ 2.1 billion to $ 2.3 billion, over the 4 to 5 year period of this activity. These costs are associated with network optimizations, exit costs and accelerated depreciation and amortization. The following table summarizes the severance charges and the associated spending under these initiatives through the fiscal year ended 2021: (Dollars in Millions) Severance Asset Write-offs/Sales Other (2) Total Reserve balance, December 29, 2019 $ 164 — 16 180 2020 activity ( 29 ) — ( 7 ) ( 36 ) Reserve balance, January 3, 2021 135 — 9 144 Current year activity: Charges — 53 420 473 Cash settlements ( 23 ) ( 404 ) ( 427 ) Settled non cash — ( 53 ) ( 53 ) Reserve balance, January 2, 2022 (1) $ 112 — 25 137 (1) Cash outlays for severance are expected to be substantially paid out over the next year in accordance with the Company's plans and local laws. (2) Other includes project expense such as salaries for employees supporting these initiatives and consulting expenses. The Company continuously reevaluates its severance reserves related to restructuring and the timing of payments due to the planned release of associates regarding several longer-term projects. The Company believes that the existing severance reserves are sufficient to cover the Global Supply Chain plans given the period over which the actions will take place. The Company will continue to assess and make adjustments as necessary if additional amounts become probable and estimable. 102 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Johnson & Johnson Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, of comprehensive income, of equity and of cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended January 2, 2022, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 2, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended January 2, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 2, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. Basis for Opinions The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or 103 disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. U.S. Pharmaceutical Rebate Reserves – Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied. Rebates and discounts provided to customers are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales. The liability for such rebates and discounts is recognized within Accrued Rebates, Returns, and Promotions on the consolidated balance sheet. A significant portion of the liability related to rebates is from the sale of pharmaceutical goods within the U.S., primarily the Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid programs, which amounted to $7.7 billion as of January 2, 2022. For significant rebate programs, which include the U.S. Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid rebate programs, rebates and discounts estimated by management are based on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis, and projected market conditions in the U.S. pharmaceutical market. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to U.S. pharmaceutical rebate reserves - Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management due to the significant measurement uncertainty involved in developing these reserves and the high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and audit effort in performing procedures and evaluating the assumptions related to contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis, and projected market conditions in the U.S. pharmaceutical market. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to U.S. pharmaceutical rebate reserves - Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid, including controls over the assumptions used to estimate these rebates. These procedures also included, among others, (i) developing an independent estimate of the rebates by utilizing third party information on price and market conditions in the U.S. pharmaceutical market, the terms of the specific rebate programs, and the historical experience and trend analysis of actual rebate claims paid; (ii) testing rebate claims processed by the Company, including evaluating those claims for consistency with the contractual and mandated terms of the Company’s rebate arrangements; and (iii) comparing the independent estimates to management’s estimates. Litigation Contingencies – Talc As described in Notes 1 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with legal matters, including talc, when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. To the extent adverse awards, judgments, or verdicts have been rendered against the Company, management does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated. For these matters, management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors, including, among other things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and unpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements; complexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. Management continues to believe that the Company has strong legal grounds to contest the talc verdicts it has appealed. Notwithstanding management’s confidence in the safety of the Company’s talc products, in certain circumstances the Company has settled cases. In October 2021, Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. (Old JJCI), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, implemented a corporate restructuring and created a subsidiary, LTL Management LLC (LTL), which became solely responsible for the talc-related liabilities, and another subsidiary, New JJCI, which became responsible for the remaining business of Old JJCI. LTL filed a voluntary petition, seeking relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. As a result of the LTL bankruptcy case, the Court entered a temporary restraining order staying all litigation against LTL and Old JJCI. On November 15, 2021, the North Carolina Bankruptcy Court confirmed the scope of the stay, issuing a Preliminary Injunction (PI) prohibiting and enjoining the commencement and prosecution of talc-related claims against LTL, Old JJCI, New JJCI, Johnson & Johnson, other of their corporate affiliates, identified retailers, insurance companies, and certain other parties. Claimants have filed a motion to dismiss the LTL bankruptcy case. The court commenced a hearing on February 14, 2022 regarding the motion to dismiss and on whether the PI should be extended. The Company has agreed to provide funding to LTL for the payment of amounts the Bankruptcy Court determines are owed by LTL through the establishment of a $2 billion trust in furtherance of this purpose. The Company has established a reserve for approximately $2 billion in connection with the aforementioned trust. The parties have not yet been able to reach a resolution of all matters related to talc, and while certain amounts under various scenarios have recently been referred to in testimony as part of the LTL bankruptcy proceedings, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amount accrued. 104 The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the talc litigation is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when assessing the likelihood of a loss being incurred and when determining whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss for the future and existing talc claims can be made, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s assessment of the loss contingencies associated with this litigation. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s evaluation of the talc litigation, including controls over determining whether a loss is probable and whether the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, as well as financial statement disclosures. These procedures also included, among others, (i) gaining an understanding of the Company’s process around the accounting and reporting for the talc litigation; (ii) discussing the status of significant known actual and potential litigation and the ongoing LTL bankruptcy proceedings with the Company’s in-house legal counsel, as well as external counsel when deemed necessary; (iii) obtaining and evaluating the letters of audit inquiry with internal and external legal counsel for significant litigation; (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assessment regarding whether an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible or probable and reasonably estimable; and (v) evaluating the sufficiency of the Company’s litigation contingencies disclosures. Litigation – Opioids As described in Notes 1 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with legal matters, including opioids, when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. To the extent adverse awards, judgments, or verdicts have been rendered against the Company, management does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated. For these matters, management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors, including, among other things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and unpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements; complexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. The Company has been named in numerous lawsuits brought by certain state and local governments, including tribal governments, related to opioids matters. In October 2019, the Company announced a proposed agreement in principle that would include the Company paying $4 billion as settlement of the matters. In October 2020, the Company agreed to contribute up to an additional $1 billion to an all-in settlement amount that would resolve opioid lawsuits filed and future claims by states, cities, counties and tribal governments, for a total of $5 billion. In July 2021, the Company announced that the terms of the agreement to settle the state and subdivision claims have been finalized, depending upon the level of participation by the various parties. The terms provide a period of time for states to elect to participate in the agreement and, thereafter, a period for the subdivisions of the participating states to opt-in. The subdivision opt-in period expired in January 2022. The Company retains the right to opt-out of the agreement until late February 2022 if, in its sole discretion, there is insufficient participation. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the opioids litigation is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when determining whether a reasonable estimate of the range of loss for the agreement to settle the opioids litigation can be made, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s assessment of the loss contingencies associated with this litigation. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s evaluation of the opioid litigation, including controls over determining whether a loss is probable and whether the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, as well as financial statement disclosures. These procedures also included, among others, (i) gaining an understanding of the Company’s process around the accounting and reporting for the opioids litigation; (ii) discussing the status of significant known actual and potential litigation and ongoing settlement negotiations with the Company’s in-house legal counsel, as well as external counsel when deemed necessary; (iii) obtaining and evaluating the letters of audit inquiry with internal and external legal counsel for significant litigation; (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assessment regarding whether an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible or probable and reasonably estimable; and (v) evaluating the sufficiency of the Company’s litigation contingencies disclosures. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Florham Park, New Jersey February 17, 2022 We have served as the Company’s auditor since at least 1920. We have not been able to determine the specific year we began serving as auditor of the Company. 105 Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, management is required to assess the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year and report, based on that assessment, whether the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective. Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the reliability of the Company’s financial reporting and the preparation of external financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal controls over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, internal control over financial reporting determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. The Company’s management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of January 2, 2022. In making this assessment, the Company used the criteria established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in “Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013).” These criteria are in the areas of control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communication, and monitoring. The Company’s assessment included extensive documenting, evaluating and testing the design and operating effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting. Based on the Company’s processes and assessment, as described above, management has concluded that, as of January 2, 2022, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective. The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of January 2, 2022 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which appears herein. /s/ J.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE Not applicable. Item 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures. At the end of the period covered by this Report, the Company evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures. The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Joaquin Duato, Chief Executive Officer, and Joseph J. Wolk, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, reviewed and participated in this evaluation. Based on this evaluation, Messrs. Duato and Wolk concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Report, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Reports on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. The information called for by this item is incorporated herein by reference to “Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting”, and the attestation regarding internal controls over financial reporting included in the “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm” included in Item 8 of this Report. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. During the fiscal quarter ended January 2, 2022, there were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required under Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. The Company has not experienced any material impact to its internal controls over financial reporting despite the fact that many of its employees have worked remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company proactively took actions to re-evaluate and refine its financial reporting process through additional monitoring controls to provide reasonable assurance that the financial results are reported accurately and timely. The Company continues to monitor and assess the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures. The Company is implementing a multi-year, enterprise-wide initiative to integrate, simplify and standardize processes and systems for the human resources, information technology, procurement, supply chain and finance functions. These are enhancements to support the growth of the Company’s financial shared service capabilities and standardize financial systems. This initiative is not in response to any identified deficiency or weakness in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. In response to this initiative, the Company has and will continue to align and streamline the design and operation of its financial control environment. Item 9B. OTHER INFORMATION Not applicable.

Management and representatives of Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the ""Company"") also may from time to time make forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements do not relate strictly to historical or current facts and reflect management’s assumptions, views, plans, objectives and projections about the future. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as “plans,” “expects,” “will,” “anticipates,” “estimates” and other words of similar meaning in conjunction with, among other things: discussions of future operations; expected operating results and financial performance; impact of planned acquisitions and dispositions; the Company’s strategy for growth; product development; regulatory approvals; market position and expenditures. Because forward-looking statements are based on current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding future events, they are subject to uncertainties, risks and changes that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of the Company's control. Investors should realize that if underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, or known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, the Company’s actual results and financial condition could vary materially from expectations and projections expressed or implied in its forward-looking statements. Investors are therefore cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements. Risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: Risks Related to Product Development, Market Success and Competition • Challenges and uncertainties inherent in innovation and development of new and improved products and technologies on which the Company’s continued growth and success depend, including uncertainty of clinical outcomes, additional analysis of existing clinical data, obtaining regulatory approvals, health plan coverage and customer access, and initial and continued commercial success; • Challenges to the Company’s ability to obtain and protect adequate patent and other intellectual property rights for new and existing products and technologies in the United States and other important markets; • The impact of patent expirations, typically followed by the introduction of competing biosimilars and generics and resulting revenue and market share losses; • Increasingly aggressive and frequent challenges to the Company’s patents by competitors and others seeking to launch competing generic, biosimilar or other products and increased receptivity of courts, the United States Patent and Trademark Office and other decision makers to such challenges, potentially resulting in loss of market exclusivity and rapid decline in sales for the relevant product sooner than expected; • Competition in research and development of new and improved products, processes and technologies, which can result in product and process obsolescence; • Competition to reach agreement with third parties for collaboration, licensing, development and marketing agreements for products and technologies; • Competition based on cost-effectiveness, product performance, technological advances and patents attained by competitors; and • Allegations that the Company’s products infringe the patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties, which could adversely affect the Company’s ability to sell the products in question and require the payment of money damages and future royalties. Risks Related to Product Liability, Litigation and Regulatory Activity • Product efficacy or safety concerns, whether or not based on scientific evidence, potentially resulting in product withdrawals, recalls, regulatory action on the part of the United States Food and Drug Administration (or international counterparts), declining sales, reputational damage, increased litigation expense and share price impact; • Impact, including declining sales and reputational damage, of significant litigation or government action adverse to the Company, including product liability claims and allegations related to pharmaceutical marketing practices and contracting strategies; • Impact of an adverse judgment or settlement and the adequacy of reserves related to legal proceedings, including patent litigation, product liability, personal injury claims, securities class actions, government investigations, employment and other legal proceedings; • Increased scrutiny of the health care industry by government agencies and state attorneys general resulting in investigations and prosecutions, which carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties, including, but not limited to, debarment from government business; • Failure to meet compliance obligations in the McNEIL-PPC, Inc. Consent Decree or any other compliance agreements with governments or government agencies, which could result in significant sanctions; • Potential changes to applicable laws and regulations affecting United States and international operations, including relating to: approval of new products; licensing and patent rights; sales and promotion of health care products; access to, and reimbursement and pricing for, health care products and services; environmental protection and sourcing of raw materials; • Compliance with local regulations and laws that may restrict the Company’s ability to manufacture or sell its products in relevant markets, including requirements to comply with medical device reporting regulations and other requirements such as the European Union's Medical Devices Regulation; • Changes in domestic and international tax laws and regulations, including changes related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the United States, increasing audit scrutiny by tax authorities around the world and exposures to additional tax liabilities potentially in excess of existing reserves; and • Issuance of new or revised accounting standards by the Financial Accounting Standards Board and regulations by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Risks Related to the Company’s Strategic Initiatives and Healthcare Market Trends • Pricing pressures resulting from trends toward health care cost containment, including the continued consolidation among health care providers and other market participants, trends toward managed care, the shift toward governments increasingly becoming the primary payers of health care expenses, significant new entrants to the health care markets seeking to reduce costs and government pressure on companies to voluntarily reduce costs and price increases; • Restricted spending patterns of individual, institutional and governmental purchasers of health care products and services due to economic hardship and budgetary constraints; • Challenges to the Company’s ability to realize its strategy for growth including through externally sourced innovations, such as development collaborations, strategic acquisitions, licensing and marketing agreements, and the potential heightened costs of any such external arrangements due to competitive pressures; • The potential that the expected strategic benefits and opportunities from any planned or completed acquisition or divestiture by the Company may not be realized or may take longer to realize than expected; and • The potential that the expected benefits and opportunities related to past and ongoing restructuring actions may not be realized or may take longer to realize than expected. Risks Related to Economic Conditions, Financial Markets and Operating Internationally • The risks associated with global operations on the Company and its customers and suppliers, including foreign governments in countries in which the Company operates. • Impact of inflation and fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates and the potential effect of such fluctuations on revenues, expenses and resulting margins; • Potential changes in export/import and trade laws, regulations and policies of the United States and other countries, including any increased trade restrictions or tariffs and potential drug reimportation legislation; • The impact on international operations from financial instability in international economies, sovereign risk, possible imposition of governmental controls and restrictive economic policies, and unstable international governments and legal systems; • The impact of global public health crises and pandemics, including the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic; • Changes to global climate, extreme weather and natural disasters that could affect demand for the Company's products and services, cause disruptions in manufacturing and distribution networks, alter the availability of goods and services within the supply chain, and affect the overall design and integrity of the Company's products and operations; and • The impact of armed conflicts and terrorist attacks in the United States and other parts of the world including social and economic disruptions and instability of financial and other markets. Risks Related to Supply Chain and Operations • Difficulties and delays in manufacturing, internally, through third party providers or otherwise within the supply chain, that may lead to voluntary or involuntary business interruptions or shutdowns, product shortages, withdrawals or suspensions of products from the market, and potential regulatory action; • Interruptions and breaches of the Company's information technology systems or those of the Company's vendors, which could result in reputational, competitive, operational or other business harm as well as financial costs and regulatory action; • Reliance on global supply chains and production and distribution processes that are complex and subject to increasing regulatory requirements that may adversely affect supply, sourcing and pricing of materials used in the Company’s products; and • The potential that the expected benefits and opportunities related to restructuring actions contemplated for the global supply chain, including the Company's transaction with Jabil, may not be realized or may take longer to realize than expected, including due to any required approvals from applicable regulatory authorities. Disruptions associated with the announced global supply chain actions may adversely affect supply and sourcing of materials used in the Company's products. Investors also should carefully read the Risk Factors described in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of certain risks that could, among other things, cause the Company’s actual results to differ materially from those expressed in its forward-looking statements. Investors should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and should not consider the risks described above and in Item 1A to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. The Company does not undertake to publicly update any forward-looking statement that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information or future events or developments. PART I Item 1. BUSINESS General Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 134,500 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the health care field. Johnson & Johnson is a holding company, with operating companies conducting business in virtually all countries of the world. The Company’s primary focus is products related to human health and well-being. Johnson & Johnson was incorporated in the State of New Jersey in 1887. The Executive Committee of Johnson & Johnson is the principal management group responsible for the strategic operations and allocation of the resources of the Company. This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities of the Company's three business segments: Consumer Health (previously referred to as Consumer), Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. Within the strategic parameters provided by the Committee, senior management groups at U.S. and international operating companies are each responsible for their own strategic plans and the day-to-day operations of those companies. Each subsidiary within the business segments is, with limited exceptions, managed by residents of the country where located. Segments of Business The Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer Health, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. Additional information required by this item is incorporated herein by reference to the narrative and tabular descriptions of segments and operating results under: “Item 7.

Many of these medicines were developed in collaboration with strategic partners or are licensed from other companies and maintain active lifecycle development programs. Medical Devices The Medical Devices segment includes a broad range of products used in the Interventional Solutions, Orthopaedics, Surgery, and Vision fields. Medical Devices in Interventional Solutions include Electrophysiology products (Biosense Webster) to treat cardiovascular diseases, Neurovascular care (Cerenovus) that treats hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke; the Orthopaedics portfolio (DePuy Synthes) is comprised of products in support of Hips, Knees, Trauma, and Spine, Sports & Other; the Surgery portfolios (Ethicon) include advanced and general surgery offerings, solutions that focus on Breast Aesthetics (Mentor) and Ear, Nose and Throat (Acclarent) procedures; and Johnson & Johnson Vision products such as ACUVUE ® Brand disposable contact lenses and ophthalmic products related to cataract and laser refractive surgery. These products are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used predominantly in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics. Geographic Areas Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 134,500 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the health care field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world with the primary focus on products related to human health and well-being. The products made and sold in the international business include many of those described above under “– Segments of Business – Consumer Health,” “– Pharmaceutical” and “– Medical Devices.” However, the principal markets, products and methods of distribution in the international business vary with the country and the culture. The products sold in international business include those developed in the U.S. and by subsidiaries abroad. Investments and activities in some countries outside the U.S. are subject to higher risks than comparable U.S. activities because the investment and commercial climate may be influenced by financial instability in international economies, restrictive economic policies and political and legal system uncertainties. Raw Materials Raw materials essential to the Company's business are generally readily available from multiple sources. Where there are exceptions, the temporary unavailability of those raw materials would not likely have a material adverse effect on the financial results of the Company. Patents The Company's subsidiaries have made a practice of obtaining patent protection on their products and processes where possible. They own, or are licensed under, a significant number of patents in the U.S. and other countries relating to their products, product uses, formulations and manufacturing processes, which in the aggregate are believed to be of material importance to the Company in the operation of its businesses. The Company’s subsidiaries face patent challenges from third parties, including challenges seeking to manufacture and market generic and biosimilar versions of the Company's key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. Significant legal proceedings and claims involving the Company's patent and other intellectual property are described in Note 19, “Legal Proceedings— Intellectual Property” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. 2 Sales of the Company’s largest product, STELARA ® (ustekinumab), accounted for approximately 9.3% of the Company's total revenues for fiscal 2020. Accordingly, the patents related to this product are believed to be material to the Company. Janssen Biotech, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, owns patents specifically related to STELARA ®. The latest expiring United States patent expires in 2023. The latest expiring European patent expires in 2024. Sales of the Company’s second largest product, DARZALEX ® (daratumumab) and DARZALEX FASPRO™ (daratumumab and hyaluronidase-fihj), accounted for approximately 5.1% of the Company's total revenues for fiscal 2020. Accordingly, the patents related to this product are believed to be material to the Company. Genmab A/S owns patents related to DARZALEX ® , and Janssen Biotech, Inc. has an exclusive license to those patents. The latest expiring licensed United States patent expires in 2029. The latest expiring licensed European patent expires in 2031. Janssen Biotech, Inc. owns a separate patent portfolio related to DARZALEX FASPRO™. Sales of the Company’s third largest product, IMBRUVICA ® (ibrutinib), accounted for approximately 5.0% of the Company's total revenues for fiscal 2020. Accordingly, patents related to this product are believed to be material to the Company. Pharmacyclics LLC (an AbbVie company) owns the patents related to IMBRUVICA ® , and Janssen Biotech, Inc. has an exclusive license to those patents. The Pharmacyclics patents and their expiration dates are listed in the Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (Orange Book). Pharmacyclics LLC and Janssen Biotech, Inc. have entered into confidential settlement agreements with certain generic companies granting licenses to market their generic ibrutinib products in the United States before the expiration of certain patents. Trademarks The Company’s subsidiaries have made a practice of selling their products under trademarks and of obtaining protection for these trademarks by all available means. These trademarks are protected by registration in the U.S. and other countries where such products are marketed. The Company considers these trademarks in the aggregate to be of material importance in the operation of its businesses. Seasonality Worldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality; however, spending has been heavier in the fourth quarter of each year than in other quarters. This reflects increased spending decisions, principally for advertising and research and development activity. Competition In all of their product lines, the Company's subsidiaries compete with companies both locally and globally. Competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved. Competition in research, both internally and externally sourced, involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. The development of new and innovative products, as well as protecting the underlying intellectual property of the Company’s product portfolio, is important to the Company's success in all areas of its business. The competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research. In addition, the development and maintenance of customer demand for the Company’s consumer products involve significant expenditures for advertising and promotion. Environment The Company is subject to a variety of U.S. and international environmental protection measures. The Company believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations. The Company’s compliance with these requirements did not change during the past year, and is not expected to have a material effect upon its capital expenditures, cash flows, earnings or competitive position. Regulation The Company’s businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which operations are conducted, and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation and enforcement. The Company is subject to costly and complex U.S. and foreign laws and governmental regulations and any adverse regulatory action may materially adversely affect the Company's financial condition and business operations. In the U.S., the drug, device and cosmetic industries have long been subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies, primarily as to product safety, efficacy, manufacturing, advertising, labeling and safety reporting. The exercise of broad regulatory powers by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the U.S. FDA) continues to result in increases in the amounts of testing and documentation required for U.S. FDA approval of new drugs and devices and a corresponding increase in the expense of product introduction. Similar trends are also evident in major markets outside of the U.S. The new medical device regulatory framework and the new privacy regulations in Europe and in other countries are examples of such increased regulation. 3 The regulatory agencies under whose purview the Company operates have administrative powers that may subject it to actions such as product withdrawals, recalls, seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions. In some cases, the Company’s subsidiaries may deem it advisable to initiate product recalls. The U.S. FDA and regulatory agencies around the globe are also increasing their enforcement activities. If the U.S. FDA were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our drugs or medical devices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, the U.S. FDA could ban such products, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded products, order a recall, repair, replacement, or refund of such products, refuse to grant pending applications for marketing authorization or require certificates of foreign governments for exports, and/or require us to notify health professionals and others that the products present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The U.S. FDA may also assess civil or criminal penalties against us, our officers or employees and impose operating restrictions on a company-wide basis, or enjoin and/or restrain certain conduct resulting in violations of applicable law. The U.S. FDA may also recommend prosecution to the US Department of Justice. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict us from effectively marketing and selling our products and limit our ability to obtain future clearances or approvals, and could result in a substantial modification to our business practices and operations. Equivalent enforcement mechanisms exist in different countries in which we conduct business. The costs of human health care have been and continue to be a subject of study, investigation and regulation by governmental agencies and legislative bodies around the world. In the U.S., attention has been focused by states, regulatory agencies and congress on drug prices and profits and programs that encourage doctors to write prescriptions for particular drugs, or to recommend, use or purchase particular medical devices. Laws and regulations have been enacted to require adherence to strict compliance standards and prevent fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. There is increased focus on interactions and financial relationships between healthcare companies and health care providers. Various transparency laws and regulations require disclosures of payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals and, beginning with disclosures in 2022, to certain non-physician practitioners. Federal and foreign laws governing international business practices require strict compliance with anti-bribery standards and certain prohibitions with respect to payments to any foreign government official. Payers have become a more potent force in the market place and increased attention is being paid to drug and medical device pricing, appropriate drug and medical device utilization and the quality and costs of health care generally. U.S. government agencies continue efforts to repeal, modify, or invalidate provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the ACA) which passed in 2010. For example, federal legislation repealed the ACA’s individual mandate tax penalty as well as the tax on generous employer-sponsored healthcare plans; the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) began permitting states to impose work requirements on persons covered by Medicaid expansion plans; certain federal subsidies to insurers have ended; and certain short-term insurance plans not offering the full array of ACA benefits have been allowed to extend in duration. Some of these changes are being challenged in U.S. courts and so their long-term impact remains uncertain. The ACA has also been subject to judicial challenge. In November 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court heard argument in Texas v. Azar , which challenges the constitutionality of the ACA. Pending resolution of the litigation, all of the ACA but the individual mandate to buy health insurance remains in effect. The U.S. government also continues to propose and implement changes to the Medicare Part D benefit including the size of manufacturer discounts in the coverage gap and catastrophic phases of the benefit. There are a number of additional bills pending in Congress and healthcare reform proposals at the state level that would affect drug pricing in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This changing federal landscape has both positive and negative impacts on the U.S. healthcare industry with much remaining uncertain as to how various provisions of federal law, and potential modification or repeal of these laws, will ultimately affect the industry. In addition, business practices in the health care industry have come under increased scrutiny, particularly in the U.S., by government agencies and state attorneys general, and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties. Further, the Company relies on global supply chains, and production and distribution processes, that are complex, are subject to increasing regulatory requirements, and may be faced with unexpected changes such as those resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and Brexit, that may affect sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in the Company's products. These processes also are subject to complex and lengthy regulatory approvals. The global regulatory landscape is also subject to change as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect the U.S. and global economies. The U.S. FDA and other health authorities have shifted resources and priorities to meet the many challenges presented by the pandemic. Pandemic-related disruptions could negatively impact the processing of regulatory submissions and slow agency review times necessary for the approval or clearance of new drugs and devices. The duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic is unpredictable and difficult to assess. 4 Employees and Human Capital Management As of January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019, the number of employees were approximately: 2020 2019 Employees 1 136,400 133,200 Full-time equivalent (FTE) positions 2 134,500 132,200 1 “Employee” is defined as an individual working full-time or part-time, excluding fixed term employees, interns and co-op employees. Employee data may not include full population from more recently acquired companies and individuals on long-term disability are excluded. Contingent workers, contractors and subcontractors are also excluded. 2 FTE represents the total number of full-time equivalent positions and does not reflect the total number of individual employees as some work part-time. Strategy The Company believes that its employees are critical to its continued success and are an essential element of its long-term strategy. Management is responsible for ensuring that its policies and processes reflect and reinforce the Company's desired corporate culture, including policies and processes related to strategy, risk management, and ethics and compliance. The Company’s human capital management strategy is built on three fundamental focus areas: • Attracting and recruiting the best talent • Developing and retaining talent • Empowering and inspiring talent Underpinning these focus areas are ongoing efforts to cultivate and foster a culture built on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), innovation, health, well-being and safety, where the Company's employees are encouraged to succeed both professionally and personally while helping the Company achieve its business goals. Culture and Employee Engagement At Johnson & Johnson, employees are guided by Our Credo which sets forth the Company's responsibilities to patients, consumers, customers, healthcare professionals, employees, communities and shareholders. Employees worldwide are further guided by the Company’s Code of Business Conduct which sets basic requirements for business conduct and serves as a foundation for the Company policies, procedures and guidelines, all of which provide additional guidance on expected employee behaviors in every market where it operates. The Company c onducts global surveys that offer its employees the ability to provide feedback and valuable insight to help address potential human resources risks and identify opportunities to improve. In 2020, 93% of global employees across 78 countries participated in Our Credo Survey which is offered in 36 languages. Growth and Development To continue to lead in the changing healthcare landscape, it is crucial that the Company continue to attract and retain top talent. The Company believes that its employees must be equipped with the right knowledge and skills and be provided with opportunities to grow and develop in their careers. Accordingly, professional development programs and educational resources 5 are available to all employees. The Company's objective is to foster a learning culture that helps shape each person’s unique career path while creating a robust pipeline of talent to deliver on the Company’s long-term strategies. In furtherance of this objective, the Company deploys a global approach to ensure development is for everyone, regardless of where they are on their career journey. In 2020, 44.6% of employees in Manager and above job categories took advantage of career opportunities by moving across functions, country or business segment lines (including upward promotion or lateral transfer and excluding employees in the research and development organizations). The Company's voluntary turnover rate was 5.2%. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) The Company is committed to workplace diversity and to cultivating, fostering, and advancing a culture of equity and inclusion. Enabling employees to perform at their best while being themselves is fundamental to the Company's continued success. The Company’s DEI vision is: Be yourself, change the world . The Company's DEI strategy focuses on three pillars that reflect the strategic priorities identified to enable the Company to address the challenges and opportunities presented by this evolving understanding of diversity: • Accelerate the Company’s efforts to advance a culture of inclusion and innovation • Build a diverse workforce for the future • Enhance business results and reputation The Company's DEI strategy is guided by internal and external insights, global best practices and continual employee feedback which remind the Company that while diversity changes by location, inclusion is the same everywhere. Compensation and Benefits As part of the Company's total rewards philosophy, the Company offers competitive compensation and benefits to attract and retain top talent. The Company is committed to fairness and equitable treatment in its compensation and benefits for employees at all levels. The Company observes legal minimum wage provisions and exceeds them where possible. The Company's total rewards offerings include an array of programs to support its employees' financial, physical, and mental well-being, including annual performance incentive opportunities, pension and retirement savings programs, health and welfare benefits, paid time off, leave programs, flexible work schedules and employee assistance programs. Health, Wellness and Safety The Company’s investment in employee health, well-being and safety is built on its conviction that advancing health for humanity starts with advancing the health of its employees. With the right awareness, focus, practices and tools, the Company ensures that all its employees around the world, as well as temporary contractors and visitors to the Company's sites, can work safely. The Company has continuously expanded health and well-being programs throughout the Company and across the globe, incorporating new thinking and technologies to keep its offerings best-in-class and to help employees achieve their personal mind and body health goals. The programs and practices the Company advances covers three core dimensions: Healthy Eating, Healthy Movement and Healthy Mind.

RISK FACTORS An investment in the Company’s common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties. The Company seeks to identify, manage and mitigate risks to our business, but uncertainties and risks are difficult to predict and many are outside of the Company's control and cannot therefore be eliminated. In addition to the other information in this report and the Company’s other filings with the SEC, investors should consider carefully the factors set forth below. Investors should be aware that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and that the following is not meant to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties. If known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, the Company’s business, results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected, potentially in a material way. Risks Related to Our Business, Industry and Operations The Company’s businesses operate in highly competitive product markets and competitive pressures could adversely affect the Company’s earnings. The Company faces substantial competition in all three operating segments and in all geographic markets. The Company’s businesses compete with companies of all sizes on the basis of cost-effectiveness, technological innovations, intellectual property rights, product performance, real or perceived product advantages, pricing and availability and rate of reimbursement. The Company also competes with other market participants in securing rights to acquisitions, collaborations and licensing agreements with third parties. Competition for rights to product candidates and technologies may result in significant investment and acquisition costs and onerous agreement terms for the Company. Competitors’ development of more effective or less costly products, and/or their ability to secure patent and other intellectual property rights and successfully market products ahead of the Company, could negatively impact sales of the Company’s existing products as well as its ability to bring new products to market despite significant prior investment in the related product development. For the Company’s pharmaceutical businesses, loss of patent exclusivity for a product often is followed by a substantial reduction in sales as competitors gain regulatory approval for generic and other competing products and enter the market. Similar competition can be triggered by the loss of exclusivity for a biological product. For the Company’s medical device businesses, technological innovation, product quality, reputation and customer service are especially important to competitiveness. Development by other companies of new or improved products, processes and technologies could threaten to make the Company’s products or technologies less desirable, less economical or obsolete. The Company’s consumer health businesses face intense competition from other branded products and retailers’ private-label brands. If the Company fails to sufficiently differentiate and market its brand name consumer products, this could adversely affect revenues and profitability of those products. Interruptions and delays in manufacturing operations could adversely affect the Company’s business, sales and reputation. The Company’s manufacture of products requires the timely delivery of sufficient amounts of complex, high-quality components and materials. The Company's subsidiaries operate 90 manufacturing facilities as well as sourcing from hundreds of suppliers around the world. The Company has in the past, and may in the future, face unanticipated interruptions and delays in manufacturing through its internal or external supply chain. Manufacturing disruptions can occur for many reasons including regulatory action, production quality deviations or safety issues, labor disputes, site-specific incidents (such as fires), natural disasters such as hurricanes and other severe weather events, raw material shortages, political unrest, terrorist attacks and epidemics or pandemics. Such delays and difficulties in manufacturing can result in product shortages, declines in sales and reputational impact as well as significant remediation and related costs associated with addressing the shortage. The Company relies on third parties to manufacture certain of our products. Any failure by or loss of a third-party manufacturer could result in delays and increased costs, which may adversely affect our business. The Company relies on third parties to manufacture certain of our products. We depend on these third party manufacturers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis and at acceptable prices. However, we cannot guarantee that these third-party manufacturers will be able to meet our near-term or long-term manufacturing requirements, which could result in lost sales and have an adverse effect on our business. Other risks associated with our reliance on third parties, including the Company’s strategic partnership with Jabil in the Medical Devices segment, to manufacture these products include reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance, misappropriation of the Company’s intellectual property, limited ability to manage our inventory, possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party and the possible termination or nonrenewal of the manufacturing agreement by the third party at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us. Moreover, if any of our third party manufacturers suffer any damage to facilities, lose benefits under material agreements, experience power outages, encounter financial difficulties, are unable to secure necessary raw materials from their suppliers or suffer any other reduction in efficiency, the Company may 7 experience significant business disruption. In the event of any such disruption, the Company would need to seek and source other qualified third-party manufacturers, likely resulting in further delays and increased costs which could affect our business adversely. Counterfeit versions of our products could harm our patients and have a negative impact on our revenues, earnings, reputation and business. Our industry continues to be challenged by the vulnerability of distribution channels to illegal counterfeiting and the presence of counterfeit products in a growing number of markets and over the Internet. Third parties may illegally distribute and sell counterfeit versions of our products, which do not meet our rigorous manufacturing and testing standards. To distributors and patients, counterfeit products may be visually indistinguishable from the authentic version. Counterfeit medicines pose a risk to patient health and safety because of the conditions under which they are manufactured – often in unregulated, unlicensed, uninspected and unsanitary sites – as well as the lack of regulation of their contents. The industry's failure to mitigate the threat of counterfeit medicines could adversely impact our business and reputation by impacting patient confidence in our authentic products, potentially resulting in lost sales, product recalls, and an increased threat of litigation. In addition, diversion of our products from their authorized market into other channels may result in reduced revenues and negatively affect our profitability. The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted certain aspects of the Company’s business and could cause disruptions or future impact to the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. We are subject to risks associated with global health crises and pandemics, including the global outbreak of the novel coronavirus and its mutations (COVID-19). The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted, and is expected to continue to adversely impact, certain aspects of the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition, including lower sales and reduced customer demand and usage of certain of our products. The spread of COVID-19 has caused the Company to modify its business practices (including instituting remote work for many of the Company's employees), and the Company may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or as the Company determines are in the best interests of our patients, customers, employees and business partners. The Company continues to monitor the situation and while we have robust business continuity plans in place across our global supply chain network to help mitigate the impact of COVID-19, these efforts may not completely prevent our business from being adversely affected and future impacts remain uncertain. While the U.S. and other countries have begun or will begin to reopen their economies, the extent to which COVID-19 will impact the Company's future operations will depend on many factors which cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration of the outbreak . Any resurgence in COVID-19 infections could result in the imposition of new mandates and prolonged restrictive measures implemented in order to control the spread of the disease. The continued global spread of COVID-19 could adversely impact the Company's operations, including, among other things, our manufacturing operations, supply chain, including third-party suppliers, sales and marketing and clinical trial operations. Any of these factors could adversely affect the Company's business, financial results, and global economic conditions generally. We also face uncertainties related to our efforts to develop a COVID-19 vaccine candidate, including uncertainties related to the risk that our development programs may not be successful, commercially viable or receive approval or Emergency Use Authorization from regulatory authorities; risks associated with clinical trial data, including further analyses of existing preclinical or clinical trial data that may be inconsistent with the data used for selection of the JNJ-78436735 vaccine candidate and dose level for the Phase 3 (ENSEMBLE) trial; the risk that clinical trial data are subject to differing interpretations and assessments, including during the peer review/publication process, in the scientific community generally, and by regulatory authorities; disruptions in the relationships between us, our third-party suppliers and external manufacturers; the risk that other companies may produce superior or competitive products; the risk that demand for any products we may develop may no longer exist; risks related to the availability of raw materials to manufacture any such products; the risk that we may not be able to recoup costs associated with our R&D and manufacturing efforts and risks associated with any changes in the way we approach or provide additional research funding for potential drug development related to COVID-19; the risk that we may not be able to create or scale up manufacturing capacity on a timely basis, that we may experience manufacturing delays once a manufacturing site is activated, or have access to logistics or supply channels commensurate with global demand for any potential approved vaccine or product candidate, which would negatively impact our ability to supply the estimated numbers of doses of our vaccine candidate within the projected time periods indicated, and other challenges and risks associated with the pace of our vaccine development program; and pricing and access challenges for such products, including in the U.S. In addition, to the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this ""Risk Factors"" section and those incorporated by reference herein, i ncluding risks relating to the Company’s effective tax rate as a result of changes in consumption as well as changes in 8 laws relating to supply of the Company’s products . Given that developments concerning the COVID-19 pandemic have been constantly evolving, additional impacts and risks may arise, including litigation, that are not presently known to the Company. Risk Related to the Government Regulation and Legal Proceedings Global sales in the Company’s pharmaceutical and medical devices segments may be negatively impacted by healthcare reforms and increasing pricing pressures. Sales of the Company’s pharmaceutical and medical device products are significantly affected by reimbursements by third-party payers such as government healthcare programs, private insurance plans and managed care organizations. As part of various efforts to contain healthcare costs, these payers are putting downward pressure on prices at which products will be reimbursed. In the U.S., increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of Medicare, Medicaid, and private sector beneficiaries, in part due to continued consolidation among health care providers, could result in further pricing pressures. In addition, increased political scrutiny could result in additional pricing pressures. Outside the U.S., numerous major markets, including the EU, United Kingdom and Japan, have pervasive government involvement in funding healthcare and, in that regard, directly or indirectly impose price controls, limit access to, or reimbursement for, the Company’s products, or reduce the value of its intellectual property protection. The Company is subject to significant legal proceedings that can result in significant expenses, fines and reputational damage. In the ordinary course of business, Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims and lawsuits involving various issues such as patent disputes, product liability and claims that their product sales, marketing and pricing practices violate various antitrust, unfair trade practices and/or consumer protection laws. The Company's more significant legal proceedings are described in Note 19, “Legal Proceedings” under Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Litigation, in general, and securities, derivative action, class action and multi-district litigation, in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. Some of these matters may include thousands of plaintiffs, may involve parties seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages, and may remain unresolved for several years. For example, the Company is a defendant in numerous lawsuits arising out of the use of body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSONS ® Baby Powder, and the Company’s sale, manufacturing and marketing of opioids. While the Company believes it has substantial defenses in these matters, it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation. The Company could in the future be required to pay significant amounts as a result of settlements or judgments in these matters, potentially in excess of accruals, including matters where the Company could be held jointly and severally liable among other defendants. The resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and cash flows for that period. The Company does not purchase third-party product liability insurance; however the Company utilizes a wholly-owned captive insurance company subject to certain limits. Product reliability, safety and effectiveness concerns can have significant negative impacts on sales and results of operations, lead to litigation and cause reputational damage. Concerns about product safety, whether raised internally or by litigants, regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence, can result in safety alerts, product recalls, governmental investigations, regulatory action on the part of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (or its counterpart in other countries), private claims and lawsuits, payment of fines and settlements, declining sales and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in the Company’s products. Product recalls have in the past, and could in the future, prompt government investigations and inspections, the shutdown of manufacturing facilities, continued product shortages and related sales declines, significant remediation costs, reputational damage, possible civil penalties and criminal prosecution. The Company faces significant regulatory scrutiny which imposes significant compliance costs and exposes the Company to government investigations, legal actions and penalties. Like other companies in the healthcare industry, the Company is subject to extensive regulation, investigations and legal action, by national, state and local government agencies in the U.S. and other countries in which they operate. Regulatory issues regarding compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) (and comparable quality regulations in foreign countries) by manufacturers of drugs, devices and consumer products can lead to fines and penalties, product recalls, product shortages, interruptions in production, delays in new product approvals and litigation. In addition, the marketing, pricing and sale of the Company’s products are subject to regulation, investigations and legal actions including under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Medicaid Rebate Program, federal and state false claims acts, state unfair trade practices acts and consumer protection laws. Scrutiny of health care industry business practices by government agencies and state attorneys general in the U.S., and any resulting investigations and prosecutions, carry risk of significant civil and criminal penalties including, but not limited to, debarment from participation in government healthcare programs. Any such debarment could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations. The most significant current investigations and 9 litigation brought by government agencies are described in Note 19, “Legal Proceedings-Government Proceedings” under Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Changes in tax laws or exposures to additional tax liabilities could negatively impact the Company’s operating results. Changes in tax laws or regulations around the world could negatively impact the Company’s effective tax rate and results of operations. A change in statutory tax rate in any country would result in the revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the period in which the new tax law is enacted. This change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The Company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the countries where it operates. Changes to the statutory tax rate may occur at any time, and any related expense or benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted. See Note 8 on income taxes for additional information. The Company conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and is addressing tax audits and disputes with many tax authorities. In connection with the 2015 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project, companies are required to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in other countries. The Company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of its tax audits and disputes to determine the appropriateness of its tax reserves. However, any tax authority could take a position on tax treatment that is contrary to the Company’s expectations, which could result in tax liabilities in excess of reserves. Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property The Company may not be able to successfully secure and defend intellectual property rights essential to the Company’s businesses. The Company owns or licenses a significant number of patents and other proprietary rights, relating to its products and manufacturing processes. These rights are essential to the Company’s businesses and materially important to the Company’s results of operations. Public policy, both within and outside the U.S., has become increasingly unfavorable toward intellectual property rights. The Company cannot be certain that it will obtain adequate patent protection for new products and technologies in the United States and other important markets or that such protections, once granted, will last as long as originally anticipated. Competitors routinely challenge the validity or extent of the Company’s owned or licensed patents and proprietary rights through litigation, interferences, oppositions and other proceedings, such as inter partes review (IPR) proceedings before the United States Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO). These proceedings absorb resources and can be protracted as well as unpredictable. In addition, challenges that the Company’s products infringe the patents of third parties could result in the need to pay past damages and future royalties and adversely affect the competitive position and sales of the products in question. The Company has faced increasing patent challenges from third parties seeking to manufacture and market generic and biosimilar versions of the Company's key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. In the U.S., manufacturers of generic versions of innovative human pharmaceutical products may challenge the validity, or claim non-infringement, of innovator products through the Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, process with the FDA and related ANDA litigation. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA), enacted in 2010, which created a new regulatory pathway for the approval by the FDA of biosimilar alternatives to innovator-developed biological products, also created mechanisms for biosimilar applicants to challenge the patents on the innovator biologics. The IPR process with the USPTO is also being used by competitors to challenge patents asserted in litigation. In the event the Company is not successful in defending its patents against such challenges, or upon the “at-risk” launch (despite pending patent infringement litigation) by the generic or biosimilar firm of its product, the Company can lose a major portion of revenues for the referenced product in a very short period of time. Current legal proceedings involving the Company’s patents and other intellectual property rights are described in Note 19, “Legal Proceedings—Intellectual Property” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Risks Related to Product Development, Regulatory Approval and Commercialization Significant challenges or delays in the Company’s innovation and development of new products, technologies and indications could have an adverse impact on the Company’s long-term success. 10 The Company’s continued growth and success depends on its ability to innovate and develop new and differentiated products and services that address the evolving health care needs of patients, providers and consumers. Development of successful products and technologies is also necessary to offset revenue losses when the Company’s existing products lose market share due to various factors such as competition and loss of patent exclusivity. New products introduced within the past five years accounted for approximately 25% of 2020 sales. The Company cannot be certain when or whether it will be able to develop, license or otherwise acquire companies, products and technologies, whether particular product candidates will be granted regulatory approval, and, if approved, whether the products will be commercially successful. The Company pursues product development through internal research and development as well as through collaborations, acquisitions, joint ventures and licensing or other arrangements with third parties. In all of these contexts, developing new products, particularly pharmaceutical and biotechnology products and medical devices, requires significant investment of resources over many years. Only a very few biopharmaceutical research and development programs result in commercially viable products. The process depends on many factors including the ability to discern patients’ and health care providers’ future needs; develop promising new compounds, strategies and technologies; achieve successful clinical trial results; secure effective intellectual property protection; obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis; and, if and when they reach the market, successfully differentiate the Company’s products from competing products and approaches to treatment. New products or enhancements to existing products may not be accepted quickly or significantly in the marketplace due to product and price competition, changes in customer preferences or healthcare purchasing patterns, resistance by healthcare providers or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. Even following initial regulatory approval, the success of a product can be adversely impacted by safety and efficacy findings in larger real-world patient populations, as well as market entry of competitive products. Risk Related to Financial and Economic Market Conditions The Company faces a variety of risks associated with conducting business internationally . The Company’s extensive operations and business activity outside the U.S. are accompanied by certain financial, economic and political risks, including those listed below. Foreign Currency Exchange : In fiscal 2020, approximately 48% of the Company’s sales occurred outside of the U.S., with approximately 23% in Europe, 7% in the Western Hemisphere, excluding the U.S., and 18% in the Asia-Pacific and Africa region. Changes in non-U.S. currencies relative to the U.S. dollar impact the Company’s revenues and expenses. While the Company uses financial instruments to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on its cash flows, unhedged exposures continue to be subject to currency fluctuations. In addition, the weakening or strengthening of the U.S. dollar may result in significant favorable or unfavorable translation effects when the operating results of the Company’s non-U.S. business activity are translated into U.S. dollars. Inflation and Currency Devaluation Risks : The Company faces challenges in maintaining profitability of operations in economies experiencing high inflation rates. The Company has accounted for operations in Argentina (beginning in the fiscal third quarter of 2018) and Venezuela as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. While the Company strives to maintain profit margins in these areas through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price increases, it might experience operating losses as a result of continued inflation. In addition, the impact of currency devaluations in countries experiencing high inflation rates or significant currency exchange fluctuations could negatively impact the Company’s operating results. Illegal Importation of Pharmaceutical Products : The illegal importation of pharmaceutical products from countries where government price controls or other market dynamics result in lower prices may adversely affect the Company’s sales and profitability in the U.S. and other countries in which the Company operates. With the exception of limited quantities of prescription drugs for personal use, foreign imports of pharmaceutical products are illegal under current U.S. law. However, the volume of illegal imports continues to rise as the ability of patients and other customers to obtain the lower-priced imports has grown significantly. Anti-Bribery and Other Regulations: The Company is subject to various federal and foreign laws that govern its international business practices with respect to payments to government officials. Those laws include the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which prohibits U.S. publicly traded companies from promising, offering, or giving anything of value to foreign officials with the corrupt intent of influencing the foreign official for the purpose of helping the Company obtain or retain business or gain any improper advantage. The Company’s business is heavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with foreign officials. Also, in many countries outside the U.S., the health care providers who prescribe human pharmaceuticals are employed by the government and the purchasers of human pharmaceuticals are government entities; 11 therefore, the Company’s interactions with these prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the FCPA. In addition to the U.S. application and enforcement of the FCPA, various jurisdictions in which the Company operates have laws and regulations, including the U.K Bribery Act 2010, aimed at preventing and penalizing corrupt and anticompetitive behavior. Enforcement activities under these laws could subject the Company to additional administrative and legal proceedings and actions, which could include claims for civil penalties, criminal sanctions, and administrative remedies, including exclusion from health care programs. Other Legal, Social and Political Risks . Other risks inherent in conducting business globally include: • protective economic policies taken by governments such as trade protection measures and import/export licensing requirements; • compliance with local regulations and laws including, in some countries, regulatory requirements restricting the Company’s ability to manufacture or sell its products in the relevant market; • diminished protection of intellectual property and contractual rights in certain jurisdictions; • potential nationalization or expropriation of the Company’s foreign assets; • political or social upheavals, economic instability, repression, or human rights issues; and • geopolitical events, including natural disasters, disruptions to markets due to war, armed conflict, terrorism, epidemics or pandemics. Failure to maintain a satisfactory credit rating could adversely affect our liquidity, capital position, borrowing costs and access to capital markets. We currently maintain investment grade credit ratings with Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's Ratings Services. Rating agencies routinely evaluate us, and their ratings of our long-term and short-term debt are based on a number of factors. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency, whether as a result of our actions or factors which are beyond our control, can increase the cost of borrowing under any indebtedness we may incur, reduce market capacity for our commercial paper or require the posting of additional collateral under our derivative contracts. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our credit ratings, and any additional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade, may have a negative impact on our liquidity, capital position and access to capital markets. Other Risks Our business depends on our ability to recruit and retain talented, highly skilled employees and a diverse workforce. Our continued growth requires us to recruit and retain talented employees representing diverse backgrounds, experiences, and skill sets. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive and our ability to compete depends on our ability to hire, develop and motivate highly skilled personnel in all areas of our organization. Maintaining our brand and reputation, as well as a diverse, equitable and inclusive work environment enables us to attract top talent. If we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain highly skilled workers and key leaders, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected. In addition, effective succession planning is important to our long-term success. Any unsuccessful implementation of our succession plans or failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. An information security incident, including a cybersecurity breach, could have a negative impact to the Company’s business or reputation. To meet business objectives, the Company relies on both internal technology (IT) systems and networks, and those of third parties and their vendors, to process and store sensitive data, including confidential research, business plans, financial information, intellectual property, and personal data that may be subject to legal protection, and ensure the continuity of the Company’s supply chain. The extensive information security and cybersecurity threats, which affect companies globally, pose a risk to the security and availability of these systems and networks, and the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the Company’s sensitive data. The Company continually assesses these threats and makes investments to increase internal protection, detection, and response capabilities, as well as ensure the Company’s third-party providers have required capabilities and controls, to address this risk . To date, the Company has not experienced any material impact to the business or operations resulting from information or cybersecurity attacks; however, because of the frequently changing attack techniques, along with the increased volume and sophistication of the attacks, there is the potential for the Company to be adversely impacted. This impact could result in reputational, competitive, operational or other business harm as well as financial costs and 12 regulatory action. The Company maintains cybersecurity insurance in the event of an information security or cyber incident; however, the coverage may not be sufficient to cover all financial, legal, business or reputational losses. Climate change or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change may negatively affect our business and results of operations. Climate change resulting from increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could present risks to our operations, including an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. Natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, such as a hurricane, tornado, earthquake, wildfire or flooding, may pose physical risks to our facilities and disrupt the operation of our supply chain. The impacts of the changing climate on water resources may result in water scarcity, limiting our ability to access sufficient high-quality water in certain locations, which may increase operational costs. Concern over climate change may also result in new or additional legal or regulatory requirements designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and/or mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment. If such laws or regulations are more stringent than current legal or regulatory obligations, we may experience disruption in, or an increase in the costs associated with sourcing, manufacturing and distribution of our products, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition Item 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS Not applicable. 13 Item 2. PROPERTIES The Company's subsidiaries operate 90 manufacturing facilities occupying approximately 15.2 million square feet of floor space.

Office and warehouse facilities are often leased. The Company also engages contract manufacturers. The Company is committed to maintaining all of its properties in good operating condition. McNEIL-PPC, Inc. (now Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc.) (McNEIL-PPC) continues to operate under a consent decree, signed in 2011 with the FDA, which governs certain McNeil Consumer Healthcare manufacturing operations, and requires McNEIL-PPC to remediate the facilities it operates in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, Fort Washington, Pennsylvania, and Las Piedras, Puerto Rico (the ""Consent Decree""). Following FDA inspections McNEIL-PPC received notifications from the FDA that all three manufacturing facilities are in conformity with applicable laws and regulations, and commercial production restarted in 2015. Under the Consent Decree, after receiving notice from the FDA of being in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, each of the three facilities is subject to a five-year audit period by a third-party cGMP expert. A third-party expert continued to reassess the sites at various times through 2020. McNEIL-PPC is awaiting FDA inspections of the facilities which have been delayed due to COVID-19.

Item 6. Reserved 18 Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION Organization and Business Segments Description of the Company and Business Segments Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 134,500 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the health care field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world with the primary focus on products related to human health and well-being. The Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer Health (previously referred to as Consumer), Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. The Consumer Health segment includes a broad range of products used in the baby care, oral care, skin health/beauty, over-the-counter pharmaceutical, women’s health and wound care markets. These products are marketed to the general public and sold online (eCommerce) and to retail outlets and distributors throughout the world. The Pharmaceutical segment is focused on six therapeutic areas, including immunology, infectious diseases, neuroscience, oncology, pulmonary hypertension, and cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Products in this segment are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers, hospitals and health care professionals for prescription use. The Medical Devices segment includes a broad range of products used in the orthopaedic, surgery, interventional solutions (cardiovascular and neurovascular) and eye health fields. These products are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics. The Executive Committee of Johnson & Johnson is the principal management group responsible for the strategic operations and allocation of the resources of the Company. This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities of the Consumer Health, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices business segments. In all of its product lines, the Company competes with other companies both locally and globally, throughout the world. Competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved. Competition in research, involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. The development of new and innovative products, as well as protecting the underlying intellectual property of the Company's product portfolio, is important to the Company’s success in all areas of its business. The competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research. In addition, the development and maintenance of customer demand for the Company’s consumer products involves significant expenditures for advertising and promotion. Management’s Objectives With “Our Credo” as the foundation, the Company’s purpose is to blend heart, science and ingenuity to profoundly change the trajectory of health for humanity. The Company is committed to bringing its full breadth and depth to ensure health for people today and for future generations. United around this common ambition, the Company is poised to fulfill its purpose and successfully meet the demands of the rapidly evolving markets in which it competes. The Company is broadly based in human healthcare, and is committed to creating value by developing accessible, high quality, innovative products and services. New products introduced within the past five years accounted for approximately 25% of 2020 sales. In 2020, $12.2 billion was invested in research and development and $7.3 billion spent on acquisitions, reflecting management’s commitment to create life-enhancing innovations and to create value through partnerships that will profoundly change the trajectory of health for humanity. A critical driver of the Company’s success is the 134,500 diverse employees worldwide. Employees are empowered and inspired to lead with the Company’s Our Credo and purpose as guides. This allows every employee to use the Company’s reach and size to advance the Company's purpose, and to also lead with agility and urgency. Leveraging the extensive resources across the enterprise enables the Company to innovate and execute with excellence. This ensures the Company can remain focused on addressing the unmet needs of society every day and invest for an enduring impact, ultimately delivering value to its patients, consumers and healthcare professionals, employees, communities and shareholders. 19 Results of Operations Analysis of Consolidated Sales For discussion on results of operations and financial condition pertaining to the fiscal years 2019 and 2018 see the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition. In 2020, worldwide sales increased 0.6% to $82.6 billion as compared to an increase of 0.6% in 2019. These sales changes consisted of the following: Sales increase/(decrease) due to: 2020 2019 Volume 3.5 % 3.7 % Price (2.3) (0.9) Currency (0.6) (2.2) Total 0.6 % 0.6 % The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures on the worldwide sales growth was a negative impact of 0.3% in 2020 and a negative impact of 1.7% in 2019. Sales by U.S. companies were $43.1 billion in 2020 and $42.1 billion in 2019. This represents increases of 2.5% in 2020 and 0.5% in 2019. Sales by international companies were $39.5 billion in 2020 and $40.0 billion in 2019. This represents a decrease of 1.3% in 2020 and an increase of 0.7% in 2019. The five-year compound annual growth rates for worldwide, U.S. and international sales were 3.3%, 3.9% and 2.8%, respectively. The ten-year compound annual growth rates for worldwide, U.S. and international sales were 3.0%, 3.9% and 2.1%, respectively. In 2020, sales by companies in Europe achieved growth of 2.8% as compared to the prior year, which included operational growth of 2.0% and a positive currency impact of 0.8%. Sales by companies in the Western Hemisphere (excluding the U.S.) experienced a sales decline of 10.2% as compared to the prior year, which included operational growth of 0.4% offset by a negative currency impact of 10.6%. Sales by companies in the Asia-Pacific, Africa region experienced a sales decline of 2.7% as compared to the prior year, including an operational decline of 3.1% partially offset by a positive currency impact of 0.4%. The 2020 results benefited from the inclusion of a 53rd week. (See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for Annual Closing Date details). The Company estimated that the fiscal year 2020 sales growth rate was enhanced by approximately 1.0%. While the additional week added a few days to sales, it also added a full week's worth of operating costs; therefore, the net earnings impact was negligible. In 2020, the Company utilized three wholesalers distributing products for all three segments that represented approximately 16.0%, 12.0% and 12.0% of the total consolidated revenues. In 2019, the Company had three wholesalers distributing products for all three segments that represented approximately 15.0%, 12.0% and 11.0% of the total consolidated revenues. Note: values may have been rounded 20 Analysis of Sales by Business Segments Consumer Health Segment Consumer Health segment sales in 2020 were $14.1 billion, an increase of 1.1% from 2019, which included 3.0% operational growth and a negative currency impact of 1.9%. U.S. Consumer Health segment sales were $6.4 billion, an increase of 9.0%. International sales were $7.7 billion, a decrease of 4.6%, which included an operational decline of 1.3% and a negative currency impact of 3.3%. In 2020, acquisitions and divestitures had a net negative impact of 0.1% on the operational sales growth of the worldwide Consumer Health segment. Major Consumer Health Franchise Sales*: % Change (Dollars in Millions) 2020 2019 ’20 vs. ’19 OTC $ 4,824 4,444 8.5 % Skin Health/Beauty** 4,450 4,593 (3.1) Oral Care 1,641 1,528 7.4 Baby Care 1,517 1,675 (9.4) Women’s Health 901 986 (8.6) Wound Care/Other 720 671 7.2 Total Consumer Health* Sales $ 14,053 13,898 1.1 % * Previously referred to as Consumer ** Previously referred to as Beauty The OTC franchise sales of $4.8 billion increased 8.5% as compared to the prior year. Growth was primarily attributable to sales from TYLENOL ® driven by COVID-19 stocking demand, ZYRTEC ® due to competitor product out of stock and PEPCID ® due to competitive product withdrawal both in the U.S., and increased consumption in anti-smoking aids. International sales were negatively impacted by COVID-19 and low incidence of cough and flu. The Skin Health/Beauty franchise sales were $4.5 billion in 2020, a decrease of 3.1% as compared to the prior year. The decline was primarily due to negative COVID-19 related impacts and SKU rationalization partially offset by growth in eCommerce and new product innovation. The Oral Care franchise sales of $1.6 billion increased 7.4% as compared to the prior year primarily attributable to sales of LISTERINE ® mouthwash due to U.S. eCommerce and club channel growth, increased stocking demand related to COVID-19 and new product launches in Asia Pacific. The Baby Care franchise sales were $1.5 billion in 2020, a decrease of 9.4% compared to the prior year. The decline was primarily due to COVID-19 related impacts, SKU rationalization and the Baby Center divestiture in the U.S. partially offset by strength in AVEENO ® baby. The Women’s Health franchise sales were $0.9 billion in 2020, a decrease of 8.6% as compared to the prior year. The decline was primarily driven by COVID-19 impacts. The Wound Care/Other franchise sales were $0.7 billion in 2020, an increase of 7.2% as compared to the prior year. Growth was due to strong performance of NEOSPORIN ® and BAND-AID ® Brand Adhesive Bandages and COVID-19 related demand in the Asia Pacific region. 21 Pharmaceutical Segment Pharmaceutical segment sales in 2020 were $45.6 billion, an increase of 8.0% from 2019, which included operational growth of 8.2% and a negative currency impact of 0.2%. U.S. sales were $25.7 billion, an increase of 7.8%. International sales were $19.8 billion, an increase of 8.3%, which included 8.8% operational growth and a negative currency impact of 0.5%. In 2020, acquisitions and divestitures had a net negative impact of 0.2% on the operational sales growth of the worldwide Pharmaceutical segment. Adjustments to previous reserve estimates positively impacted the Pharmaceutical segment operational growth by approximately 1.0% in both fiscal years 2020 and 2019.

This was partially offset by COVID-19 related demand and lower sales of REMICADE ® (infliximab) due to increased discounts/rebates and biosimilar competition. The patents for REMICADE ® (infliximab) in certain countries in Europe expired in February 2015. Biosimilar versions of REMICADE ® have been introduced in certain markets outside the United States, resulting in a reduction in sales of REMICADE ® in those markets. Additional biosimilar competition will likely result in a further reduction in sales of REMICADE ® in markets outside the United States. In the United States, a biosimilar version of REMICADE ® was introduced in 2016, and additional competitors continue to enter the market. Continued infliximab biosimilar competition in the U.S. market will result in a further reduction in U.S. sales of REMICADE ® . Infectious disease products sales were $3.6 billion in 2020, representing an increase of 4.7% as compared to the prior year primarily due to strong sales of SYMTUZA ® and JULUCA ® . This was partially offset by lower sales of PREZISTA ® and PREZCOBIX ® /REZOLSTA ® due to increased competition and loss of exclusivity of PREZISTA ® in certain countries outside the U.S. Neuroscience products sales were $6.5 billion, representing an increase of 3.5% as compared to the prior year. Paliperidone long-acting injectables growth driven by sales of INVEGA SUSTENNA ® /XEPLION ® (paliperidone palmitate) and INVEGA TRINZA ® /TREVICTA ® from new patient starts and persistence. The growth was partially offset by migration from RISPERDAL CONSTA ® (risperidone) and declines in CONCERTA ® (methylphenidate) due to competitive entrants. Oncology products achieved sales of $12.4 billion in 2020, representing an increase of 15.7% as compared to the prior year. Contributors to the growth were strong sales of DARZALEX ® (daratumumab) driven by patient uptake in all lines of therapy and the launch of a subcutaneous formulation in the U.S. and E.U.; IMBRUVICA ® (ibrutinib) due to market growth globally and maintaining strong share and the continued global launch uptake and share gains of ERLEADA ® (apalutamide). Additionally, the growth was negatively impacted by declining sales of ZYTIGA ® (abiraterone acetate) and VELCADE ® (bortezomib) due to generic competition. Pulmonary Hypertension products achieved sales of $3.1 billion, representing an increase of 20.0% as compared to the prior year. Sales growth of OPSUMIT ® (macitentan) and UPTRAVI ® (selexipag) were due to continued share gains and market growth. Additionally, sales of TRACLEER ® (bosentan) were negatively impacted by generics and migration to OPSUMIT ® . Cardiovascular/Metabolism/Other products sales were $4.9 billion, a decline of 6.0% as compared to the prior year. Sales growth of INVOKANA ® /INVOKAMET ® (canagliflozin) were due to market growth and favorable channel mix dynamics in the U.S. and strength in the European region partially offset by U.S. share declines due to competitive pressures. The growth of XARELTO ® (rivaroxaban) was due to demand growth partially offset by higher rebates. Lower sales of PROCRIT ® / EPREX ® (epoetin alfa) were due to biosimilar competition. 23 During 2020, the Company advanced its pipeline with several regulatory submissions and approvals for new drugs and additional indications for existing drugs as follows: Product Name (Chemical Name) Indication US Approval EU Approval US Filing EU Filing Amivantamab Treatment of Patients with Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer with EGFR Exon 20 Insertion Mutations • • DARZALEX ® (daratumumab) Combination Regimen for Newly Diagnosed, Transplant-eligible Patients with Multiple Myeloma • DARZALEX ® (daratumumab) Combination with Carfilzomib and Dexamethasone for patients with Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma • DARZALEX ® FASPRO (daratumumab and hyaluronidase) Subcutaneous Formulation of Daratumumab in the Treatment of Patients with Multiple Myeloma • • ERLEADA ® (apalutamide) Treatment of Metastatic Castration-Sensitive Prostate Cancer • IMBRUVICA ® (ibrutinib) In combination with Rituximab for treatment of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia • INVOKANA ® (canagliflozin) Treatment of Diabetic Kidney Disease • rilpivirine and cabotegravir For Monthly, Injectable, Two Drug Regimen for Treatment of HIV • • Paliperidone Pamitate 6-month Treatment of Schizophrenia • • Ponesimod Treatment of adults with Relapsed Multiple Sclerosis • • SIMPONI ARIA ® (golimumab) Treatment of Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis and Juvenile Psoriatic Arthritis • SIRTURO ® (bedaquiline) Combination Therapy to Treat Children with Pulmonary Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis • • SPRAVATO ® (esketamine) Rapid Reduction of Depressive Symptoms in Adults with Major Depressive Disorder who have Active Suicidal Ideation with Intent • STELARA ® (ustekinumab) Treatment of Pediatric Patients with Moderate to Severe Plaque Psoriasis • • TREMFYA ® (guselkumab) Treatment of Adults with Active Psoriatic Arthritis • • Uptravi ® IV Pulmonary arterial hypertension • XARELTO ® (rivaroxaban) New Indication to Expand Use in Patients with Peripheral Artery Disease • ZABDENO (Ad26.ZEBOV) and MVABEA (MVA-BN-Filo) Preventive Ebola Vaccine • 24 Medical Devices Segment The Medical Devices segment sales in 2020 were $23.0 billion, a decrease of 11.6% from 2019, which included an operational decrease of 11.4% and a negative currency impact of 0.2%. U.S. sales were $11.0 billion, a decrease of 10.9% as compared to the prior year. International sales were $11.9 billion, a decrease of 12.2% as compared to the prior year, with an operational decrease of 11.8% and a negative currency impact of 0.4%. In 2020, the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures on the Medical Devices segment worldwide operational sales growth was a negative 0.9% of which, the divestiture of Advanced Sterilization Products (ASP) had an impact of approximately 0.8%. Growth was negatively impacted by COVID-19 and associated deferral of medical procedures.

The decline in Advanced Surgery was primarily driven by the negative impact of COVID-19 and competitive pressures in the U.S. This was partially offset by the success of new products outside the U.S. and the recovery of an isolated supply disruption in the prior year related to SURGIFLO ® . The decline in General Surgery was primarily driven by the negative impact of COVID-19 and the ASP divestiture. The Orthopaedics franchise sales were $7.8 billion in 2020, a decrease of 12.2% from 2019. The decline in hips was driven by the negative impact of COVID-19 partially offset by a leadership position in the Anterior approach, strong market demand for the ACTIS ® stem and enabling technologies – KINCISE™ and VELYS™ Hip Navigation. The decline in knees was driven by the negative impact of COVID-19. The decline in Trauma was driven by the negative impact of COVID-19 partially offset by strength from new products. The decline in Spine, Sports & Other was driven by the negative impact of COVID-19 partially offset by the uptake of new products. The Vision franchise sales were of $3.9 billion in 2020, a decrease of 15.2% from 2019. The Contact Lenses/Other operational decline was due to the negative impact of COVID-19. The Surgical operational decline was primarily driven by the negative impact of COVID-19 and competitive pressures in the U.S. The Interventional Solutions franchise achieved sales of $3.0 billion in 2020, an increase of 1.6% from 2019. Growth in the electrophysiology business was driven by Atrial Fibrillation procedure growth coupled with strength from new products and market recovery offsetting negative impacts from COVID-19. 25 Analysis of Consolidated Earnings Before Provision for Taxes on Income Consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income was $16.5 billion and $17.3 billion for the years 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Research and Development increased as a percent to sales primarily driven by: • Segment mix driven by a higher percentage of sales generated by the Pharmaceutical business versus the prior year • The negative COVID-19 impact on Medical Devices sales • Increased investment in the Medical Devices business related to robotics and digital programs • Portfolio progression including the COVID-19 vaccine in the Pharmaceutical business, net of governmental reimbursements Research facilities are located in the U.S., Belgium, Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Israel, the Netherlands, Poland, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom with additional R&D support in over 30 other countries. In-Process Research and Development (IPR&D): In fiscal year 2020, the Company recorded an IPR&D charge of $0.2 billion primarily related to a partial impairment due to timing and progression of one of the digital surgery platforms acquired with the Auris Health acquisition. In the fiscal year 2019, the Company recorded an IPR&D charge of $0.9 billion for the remaining intangible asset value related to the development program of AL-8176, an investigational drug for the treatment of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) acquired with the 2014 acquisition of Alios Biopharma Inc. The impairment charge was based on additional information, including clinical data, which became available and led to the Company's decision to abandon the development of AL-8176. Other (Income) Expense, Net: Other (income) expense, net is the account where the Company records gains and losses related to the sale and write-down of certain investments in equity securities held by Johnson & Johnson Innovation - JJDC, Inc. (JJDC), unrealized gains and losses on investments, gains and losses on divestitures, certain transactional currency gains and losses, acquisition-related costs, litigation accruals and settlements, as well as royalty income. Other (income) expense, net for the fiscal year 2020 was unfavorable by $0.4 billion as compared to the prior year primarily due to the following: (Dollars in Billions)(Income)/Expense 2020 2019 Change Litigation expense (1) $ 5.1 5.1 — Acquisition and Integration related (2) (1.1) 0.3 (1.4) Unrealized (gains)/losses on securities (0.5) (0.6) 0.1 Equity step-up gain related to DR.

(2) 2020 is primarily driven by a contingent consideration reversal of approximately $1.1 billion related to the timing of certain developmental milestones associated with the Auris Health acquisition. (3) 2019 included the divestiture of ASP Interest (Income) Expense: The fiscal year 2020 included net interest expense of $90 million as compared to income of $39 million in the fiscal year 2019. This was primarily due to reduced interest income resulting from lower rates of interest earned on cash balances and a higher average debt balance. This was partially offset by a lower average debt interest rate and a higher average cash balance. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $25.2 billion at the end of 2020, and averaged $22.2 billion as compared to the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities total of $19.3 billion and $19.5 billion average cash balance in 2019. The total debt balance at the end of 2020 was $35.3 billion with an average debt balance of $31.5 billion as compared to $27.7 billion at the end of 2019 and an average debt balance of $29.1 billion. In the fiscal third quarter of 2020, the Company issued approximately $5.0 billion of commercial paper, with approximately $0.8 billion outstanding at year end. In the fiscal third quarter of 2020, the Company issued senior unsecured notes for a total of $7.5 billion. Income Before Tax by Segment Income (loss) before tax by segment of business were as follows: Income Before Tax Segment Sales Percent of Segment Sales (Dollars in Millions) 2020 2019 2020 2019 2020 2019 Consumer Health $ (1,064) 2,061 14,053 13,898 (7.6) % 14.8 Pharmaceutical 15,462 8,816 45,572 42,198 33.9 20.9 Medical Devices 3,044 7,286 22,959 25,963 13.3 28.1 Total (1) 17,442 18,163 82,584 82,059 21.1 22.1 Less: Net expense not allocated to segments (2) 945 835 Earnings before provision for taxes on income $ 16,497 17,328 82,584 82,059 20.0 % 21.1 (1) See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details. (2) Amounts not allocated to segments include interest (income) expense and general corporate (income) expense. Consumer Health Segment: In 2020, the Consumer Health segment loss before tax as a percent of sales was (7.6)% versus income before tax of 14.8% in 2019. The decrease in the income before tax as a percent of sales was primarily driven by the following: • Higher litigation expense of $3.9 billion in 2020 vs. $0.4 billion in 2019 (primarily associated with talc related reserves and certain settlements) • The fiscal year 2019 included a gain of $0.3 billion related to the Company's previously held equity investment in DR. CI:LABO partially offset by: • Portfolio and investment optimization including execution of the ongoing SKU rationalization program Pharmaceutical Segment: In 2020, the Pharmaceutical segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 33.9% versus 20.9% in 2019. The increase in the income before tax as a percent of sales was primarily driven by the following: • Lower litigation expense of $0.8 billion in 2020 vs. $4.3 billion in 2019 (primarily related to the agreement in principle to settle opioid litigation, of which $1.0 billion is in 2020 and $4.0 billion is in 2019) • An in-process research and development charge of $0.9 billion in fiscal 2019 related to Alios • Lower acquisition and integration related costs in fiscal 2020 • Leveraging in selling, marketing and administrative expense Medical Devices Segment: In 2020, the Medical Devices segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 13.3% versus 28.1% in 2019. The decrease in the income before tax as a percent to sales was primarily driven by the following: • A gain of $2.0 billion related to the ASP divestiture recorded in the fiscal 2019 • Idle capacity costs associated with COVID-19 related production slow downs in fiscal 2020 • Establishment of obsolescence reserves and fixed cost deleveraging associated with the impact of COVID-19 in fiscal 2020 • The negative impact of COVID-19 on sales in fiscal 2020 28 • An in-process research and development charge of $0.2 billion in fiscal 2020 primarily related to the Auris Health acquisition partially offset by: • A contingent consideration reversal of approximately $1.1 billion in fiscal 2020 related to the timing of certain developmental milestones associated with the Auris Health acquisition • Litigation expense was $0.3 billion in 2020 vs. $0.4 billion in 2019 Restructuring: In the fiscal second quarter of 2018, the Company announced plans to implement actions across its global supply chain that are intended to enable the Company to focus resources and increase investments in critical capabilities, technologies and solutions necessary to manufacture and supply its product portfolio of the future, enhance agility and drive growth. The Company expects these supply chain actions will include expanding its use of strategic collaborations, and bolstering its initiatives to reduce complexity, improving cost-competitiveness, enhancing capabilities and optimizing its network. Discussions regarding specific future actions are ongoing and are subject to all relevant consultation requirements before they are finalized. In total, the Company expects these actions to generate approximately $0.6 to $0.8 billion in annual pre-tax cost savings that will be substantially delivered by 2022. The Company expects to record pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $1.9 to $2.3 billion. The Company estimates that approximately 70% of the cumulative pre-tax costs will result in cash outlays. In 2020, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $0.4 billion, which is included on the following lines of the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, $0.2 billion in restructuring, $0.1 billion in other (income) expense and $0.1 billion in cost of products sold. Total project costs of approximately $1.3 billion have been recorded since the restructuring was announced. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the restructuring programs. Provision for Taxes on Income: The worldwide effective income tax rate was 10.8% in 2020 and 12.7% in 2019. During the fiscal first quarter of 2021, the Internal Revenue Service published final regulations addressing the requirements for tax deductibility of settlement payments. The Company recorded a pre-tax reserve for $4.0 billion in the fiscal year 2019 based on the agreement in principle to settle opioid litigation and recorded an additional pre-tax $1.0 billion in the fiscal third quarter of 2020 upon which an effective rate of 21.4% has been applied. For discussion related to the fiscal 2020 provision for taxes refer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity & Cash Flows Cash and cash equivalents were $14.0 billion at the end of 2020 as compared to $17.3 billion at the end of 2019. The primary sources and uses of cash that contributed to the $3.3 billion decrease were: (Dollars In Billions) $ 17.3 Q4 2019 Cash and cash equivalents balance 23.5 cash generated from operating activities (20.8) net cash used by investing activities (6.1) net cash used by financing activities 0.1 effect of exchange rate and rounding $ 14.0 Q4 2020 Cash and cash equivalents balance In addition, the Company had $11.2 billion in marketable securities at the end of fiscal year 2020 and $2.0 billion at the end of fiscal year 2019. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. 29 Cash flow from operations of $23.5 billion was the result of: (Dollars In Billions) $ 14.7 Net Earnings 7.3 non-cash expenses and other adjustments primarily for depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, asset write-downs and credit losses and accounts receivable allowances partially offset by the deferred tax provision and net gain on sale of assets/businesses 0.8 decrease in accounts receivable 5.9 an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and other current and non-current liabilities (4.0) an increase in inventories and other current and non-current assets (1.2) contingent consideration reversal (related to the timing of certain developmental milestones associated with the Auris Health acquisition) and rounding $ 23.5 Cash Flow from operations Investing activities use of $20.8 billion of cash was primarily used for: (Dollars In Billions) $ (7.3) primarily related to the acquisitions of Momenta, bermekimab and related assets from XBiotech Inc. as well as the acquisition of all outstanding shares in Verb Surgical Inc. (3.3) additions to property, plant and equipment (9.0) net purchases of investments (1.0) Credit support agreements activity, net 0.3 proceeds from the disposal of assets/businesses, net (0.5) other (primarily licenses and milestones) $ (20.8) Net cash used for investing activities Financing activities use of $6.1 billion of cash was primarily used for: (Dollars In Billions) $ (10.5) dividends to shareholders (3.2) repurchase of common stock 7.1 net proceeds from short and long term debt 1.1 proceeds from stock options exercised/employee withholding tax on stock awards, net (0.3) Credit support agreements activity, net (0.3) other $ (6.1) Net cash used for financing activities As of January 3, 2021, the Company's notes payable and long-term debt was in excess of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. As of January 3, 2021, the net debt position was $10.1 billion as compared to the prior year of $8.4 billion. There was an increase in the net debt position due to increased borrowings in the fiscal third quarter of 2020. The debt balance at the end of 2020 was $35.3 billion as compared to $27.7 billion in 2019. Considering recent market conditions and the on-going COVID-19 crisis, the Company has evaluated its operating cash flows and liquidity profile and does not foresee any significant incremental risk. The Company anticipates that operating cash flows, the ability to raise funds from external sources, borrowing capacity from existing committed credit facilities and access to the commercial paper markets will continue to provide sufficient resources to fund operating needs, including the talc litigation and agreement in principle to settle opioid litigation of which the majority may be paid over the next two to three years. In addition, the Company monitors the global capital markets on an ongoing basis and from time to time may raise capital when market conditions are favorable. In the fiscal 30 third quarter of 2020, the Company issued approximately $5.0 billion of commercial paper, with approximately $0.8 billion outstanding at year end. In the fiscal third quarter of 2020, the Company issued senior unsecured notes for a total of $7.5 billion. For additional details on borrowings, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The net proceeds from this offering were used to fund the Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. acquisition which closed on October 1, 2020 and for general corporate purposes . Additionally, as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), the Company has access to its cash outside the U.S. at a significantly reduced cost. The following table summarizes the Company’s material contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as of January 3, 2021: To satisfy these obligations, the Company intends to use cash from operations. (Dollars in Millions) Tax Legislation (TCJA) Debt Obligations Interest on Debt Obligations Total 2021 $ 812 1,799 949 3,560 2022 812 2,226 908 3,946 2023 1,522 1,552 880 3,954 2024 2,029 1,598 842 4,469 2025 2,536 1,744 789 5,069 After 2025 — 25,515 9,503 35,018 Total $ 7,711 34,434 13,871 56,016 For tax matters, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The table does not include activity related to business combinations or the Company’s approximate $0.9 billion in contractual supply commitments associated with its development of a COVID-19 vaccine. Financing and Market Risk The Company uses financial instruments to manage the impact of foreign exchange rate changes on cash flows. Accordingly, the Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to protect the value of certain foreign currency assets and liabilities and to hedge future foreign currency transactions primarily related to product costs. Gains or losses on these contracts are offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions. A 10% appreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the January 3, 2021 market rates would increase the unrealized value of the Company’s forward contracts by $121 million. Conversely, a 10% depreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the January 3, 2021 market rates would decrease the unrealized value of the Company’s forward contracts by $148 million. In either scenario, the gain or loss on the forward contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated earnings and cash flows. The Company hedges the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and the effect on certain assets and liabilities in foreign currency, by entering into currency swap contracts. A 1% change in the spread between U.S. and foreign interest rates on the Company’s interest rate sensitive financial instruments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of the Company’s swap contracts by approximately $1,667 million. In either scenario, at maturity, the gain or loss on the swap contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated cash flows. The Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Further, the Company has a policy of only entering into contracts with parties that have at least an investment grade credit rating. The counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions and there is no significant concentration of exposure with any one counterparty. Management believes the risk of loss is remote. The Company entered into credit support agreements (CSA) with certain derivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on respective credit ratings and netting agreements. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on credit support agreements. The Company invests in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities which carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. A 1% (100 basis points) change in spread on the Company’s interest rate sensitive investments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of cash equivalents and current marketable securities by approximately $36 million. The Company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous banks worldwide. In September 2020, the Company secured a new 364-day Credit Facility. Total credit available to the Company approximates $10 billion, which expires on September 9, 2021. Interest charged on borrowings under the credit line agreement is based on either bids provided by banks, London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR), Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) Swap Curve or other applicable market rate as allowed plus applicable margins. Commitment fees under the agreement are not material. 31 Total borrowings at the end of 2020 and 2019 were $35.3 billion and $27.7 billion, respectively. The increase in borrowings was the issuance of notes in 2020 when market conditions were favorable. In 2020, net debt (cash and current marketable securities, net of debt) was $10.1 billion compared to net debt of $8.4 billion in 2019. Total debt represented 35.8% of total capital (shareholders’ equity and total debt) in 2020 and 31.8% of total capital in 2019. Shareholders’ equity per share at the end of 2020 was $24.04 compared to $22.59 at year-end 2019. A summary of borrowings can be found in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Dividends The Company increased its dividend in 2020 for the 58th consecutive year. Cash dividends paid were $3.98 per share in 2020 and $3.75 per share in 2019. On January 4, 2021, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $1.01 per share, payable on March 9, 2021 to shareholders of record as of February 23, 2021. Other Information Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are based on the Company’s consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and other related disclosures. Actual results may or may not differ from these estimates. The Company believes that the understanding of certain key accounting policies and estimates are essential in achieving more insight into the Company’s operating results and financial condition. These key accounting policies include revenue recognition, income taxes, legal and self-insurance contingencies, valuation of long-lived assets, assumptions used to determine the amounts recorded for pensions and other employee benefit plans and accounting for stock based awards. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts the Company’s business and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors including, but not limited to, the magnitude and duration of COVID-19, the extent to which it will impact worldwide macroeconomic conditions including interest rates, employment rates and health insurance coverage, the speed of the anticipated recovery, and governmental and business reactions to the pandemic. The Company assessed certain accounting matters that generally require consideration of forecasted financial information in context with the information reasonably available to the Company and the unknown future impacts of COVID-19 as of January 3, 2021 and through the date of this report. The accounting matters assessed included, but were not limited to, the Company’s allowance for doubtful accounts and credit losses, inventory and related reserves, accrued rebates and associated reserves, and the carrying value of the goodwill and other long-lived assets. While there was not a material impact to the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended January 3, 2021, the Company’s future assessment of the magnitude and duration of COVID-19, as well as other factors, could result in material impacts to the Company’s consolidated financial statements in future reporting periods. Revenue Recognition: The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the goods to customers. The Company's global payment terms are typically between 30 to 90 days. Provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns and discounts to customers are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales. Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants, as well as market conditions, including consideration of competitor pricing. Rebates are estimated based on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served. The Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through the analysis of wholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally generated information. Sales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals. Sales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in the field, or in specific areas, product recall. The sales returns reserve is based on historical return trends by product and by market as a percent to gross sales. In accordance with the Company’s accounting policies, the Company generally issues credit to customers for returned goods. The Company’s sales returns reserves are accounted for in accordance with the U.S. GAAP guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns reserves are recorded at full sales value. Sales returns in the Consumer Health and Pharmaceutical segments are almost exclusively not resalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the Medical Devices segment are typically resalable but are not material. The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products. The sales returns reserve for the total Company has been approximately 1.0% of annual net trade sales during the fiscal years 2020 and 2019. 32 Promotional programs, such as product listing allowances and cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in the same period as related sales. Continuing promotional programs include coupons and volume-based sales incentive programs. The redemption cost of consumer coupons is based on historical redemption experience by product and value. Volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales volumes for the incentive period and are recorded as products are sold. These arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred or recorded as a reduction of revenue. The Company also earns profit-share payments through collaborative arrangements of certain products, which are included in sales to customers. For all years presented, profit-share payments were less than 3.0% of the total revenues and are included in sales to customers. In addition, the Company enters into collaboration arrangements that contain multiple revenue generating activities. Amounts due from collaborative partners for these arrangements are recognized as each activity is performed or delivered, based on the relative selling price. Upfront fees received as part of these arrangements are deferred and recognized over the performance period. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures on collaborations. Reasonably likely changes to assumptions used to calculate the accruals for rebates, returns and promotions are not anticipated to have a material effect on the financial statements. The Company currently discloses the impact of changes to assumptions in the quarterly or annual filing in which there is a material financial statement impact. Below are tables that show the progression of accrued rebates, returns, promotions, reserve for doubtful accounts and reserve for cash discounts by segment of business for the fiscal years ended January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019.

The Company estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on enacted tax regulations and rates. Future changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company follows U.S. GAAP, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Management believes that changes in these estimates would not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial position. The Company has recorded deferred tax liabilities on all undistributed earnings prior to December 31, 2017 from its international subsidiaries. The Company has not provided deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings subsequent to January 1, 2018 from certain international subsidiaries where the earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. The Company intends to continue to reinvest these earnings in those international operations. If the Company decides at a later date to repatriate these earnings to the U.S., the Company would be required to provide for the net tax effects on these amounts. The Company estimates that the total tax effect of this repatriation would be approximately $0.7 billion under current enacted tax laws and regulations and at current currency exchange rates. During the fiscal first quarter of 2021, the Internal Revenue Service published final regulations addressing the requirements for tax deductibility of settlement payments. The Company recorded a pre-tax reserve for $4.0 billion in fiscal 2019 based on the agreement in principle to settle opioid litigation and recorded an additional pre-tax $1.0 billion in the fiscal third quarter of 2020 upon which an effective rate of 21.4% has been applied. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding income taxes. Legal and Self Insurance Contingencies: The Company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal proceedings and product liability claims as these arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on management’s judgment as to the probability of losses and, where applicable, actuarially determined estimates. The Company has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals in the self insurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated. The Company follows the provisions of U.S. GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies. A liability is recorded when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. See Notes 1 and 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding product liability and legal proceedings. Long-Lived and Intangible Assets: The Company assesses changes, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows in evaluating the value of the Company’s property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets. As these assumptions and estimates may change over time, it may or may not be necessary for the Company to record impairment charges. Employee Benefit Plans: The Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit, defined contribution and termination indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide. These plans are based on assumptions for the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, expected salary increases, health care cost trend rates and attrition rates. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on these rates. Stock Based Compensation: The Company recognizes compensation expense associated with the issuance of equity instruments to employees for their services. Based on the type of equity instrument, the fair value is estimated on the date of grant using either the Black-Scholes option valuation model or a combination of both the Black-Scholes option valuation model and Monte Carlo valuation model, and is expensed in the financial statements over the service period. The input assumptions used in determining fair value are the expected life, expected volatility, risk-free rate and expected dividend yield. Prior to fiscal 2020, for performance share units, the fair market value was calculated for each of the three component goals at the date of grant: operational sales, adjusted operational earnings per share and relative total shareholder return. Beginning in fiscal 2020, for performance share units, the fair market value is calculated for the two component goals at the date of grant: adjusted operational earnings per share and relative total shareholder return. The fair values for the earnings per share goal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the fair market value of the shares at the time of the award, discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the performance share units during the vesting period. The fair value for the relative total shareholder return goal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo valuation model. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

In the fiscal third quarter of 2020, the Company issued approximately $5.0 billion of commercial paper, with approximately $0.8 billion outstanding at year end, for additional liquidity. Additionally, in the fiscal third quarter of 2020, the Company issued senior unsecured notes for a total of $7.5 billion. The net proceeds from this offering were used to fund the Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. acquisition on October 1, 2020 and for general corporate purposes. • Domestic and Foreign Legislation: The Company will continue to assess and evaluate the on-going global legislative efforts to combat the COVID-19 impact on economies and the sectors in which it participates. Currently, the recent legislative acts put in place are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s operations. In fiscal 2020, the Company entered into a series of contract manufacturing arrangements for vaccine production with third party contract manufacturing organizations. These arrangements provide the Company with future supplemental commercial capacity for vaccine production and potentially transferable rights to such production if capacity is not required. Amounts paid and contractually obligated to be paid to these contract manufacturing organizations of approximately $0.9 billion are reflected in the prepaid expenses and other, other assets, accrued liabilities and other liabilities accounts in the Company's consolidated balance sheet upon execution of each agreement. Additionally, the Company has entered into certain vaccine development cost sharing arrangements with government related organizations. The Company is aware that its products are used in an environment where, for more than a decade, policymakers, consumers and businesses have expressed concerns about the rising cost of health care. In response to these concerns, the Company has a long-standing policy of pricing products responsibly. For the period 2010 - 2020, in the U.S., the weighted average compound annual growth rate of the Company’s net price increases for health care products (prescription and over-the-counter drugs, hospital and professional products) was below the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI). The Company operates in certain countries where the economic conditions continue to present significant challenges. The Company continues to monitor these situations and take appropriate actions. Inflation rates continue to have an effect on worldwide economies and, consequently, on the way companies operate. The Company has accounted for operations in Argentina (beginning in the fiscal third quarter of 2018) and Venezuela as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. This did not have a material impact to the Company's results in the period. In the face of increasing costs, the Company strives to maintain its profit margins through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price increases. In June 2016, the United Kingdom (U.K.) held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union (E.U.), commonly referred to as “Brexit”. The U.K. officially exited the E.U. on January 31, 2020, however, there was a transition period to allow time to agree the terms of a new trade deal. On December 30, 2020, the U.K., E.U. and the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) signed the EU–UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA). Over the last few years, Brexit has created global political and economic uncertainty and has led to volatility in exchange rates and interest rates, additional cost containment by third-party payors and changes in regulations. While the UK and EU have now agreed on a future trade and cooperation agreement, it is still unclear what the ultimate financial, trade, regulatory and legal implications the withdrawal of the U.K. from the E.U. will have. However, the Company currently does not believe that these and other related effects will have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position or operating results. As of January 3, 2021, the business of the Company’s U.K. subsidiaries represented less than 6% of the Company’s consolidated assets and less than 3% of the Company's fiscal twelve months revenues. The Company is exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. A 1% change in the value of the U.S. Dollar as compared to all foreign currencies in which the Company had sales, income or expense in 2020 would have increased or decreased the translation of foreign sales by approximately $384 million and net income by approximately $115 million. 36 Governments around the world consider various proposals to make changes to tax laws, which may include increasing or decreasing existing statutory tax rates. A change in statutory tax rate in any country would result in the revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the period in which the new tax law is enacted. This change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The Company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the countries where it operates. Changes to the statutory tax rate may occur at any time, and any related expense or benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted. The Company faces various worldwide health care changes that may continue to result in pricing pressures that include health care cost containment and government legislation relating to sales, promotions and reimbursement of health care products. Changes in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of health care products and services, including delaying medical procedures, rationing prescription medications, reducing the frequency of physician visits and foregoing health care insurance coverage, as a result of the current global economic downturn, may continue to impact the Company’s businesses. The Company also operates in an environment increasingly hostile to intellectual property rights. Firms have filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications or Biosimilar Biological Product Applications with the FDA or otherwise challenged the coverage and/or validity of the Company's patents, seeking to market generic or biosimilar forms of many of the Company’s key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. In the event the Company is not successful in defending the patent claims challenged in the resulting lawsuits, generic or biosimilar versions of the products at issue will be introduced to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for those products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. There is also a risk that one or more competitors could launch a generic or biosimilar version of the product at issue following regulatory approval even though one or more valid patents are in place. Legal Proceedings Johnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial and other matters; governmental investigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. The Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of January 3, 2021, the Company has determined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal issue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance with ASC 450-20-25. For these and other litigation and regulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors including, among other things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and unpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements; complexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. To the extent adverse verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated. In the Company's opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with counsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company's balance sheet, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position. However, the resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and cash flows for that period. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding legal proceedings.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company). Intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated. Columns and rows within tables may not add due to rounding. Percentages have been calculated using actual, non-rounded figures. Description of the Company and Business Segments The Company has approximately 134,500 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the health care field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world and its primary focus is on products related to human health and well-being. The Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer Health (previously referred to as Consumer), Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. The Consumer Health segment includes a broad range of products used in the baby care, oral care, skin health/beauty, over-the-counter pharmaceutical, women’s health and wound care markets. These products are marketed to the general public and sold online (eCommerce) and to retail outlets and distributors throughout the world. The Pharmaceutical segment is focused on six therapeutic areas, including immunology, infectious diseases, neuroscience, oncology, pulmonary hypertension, and cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Products in this segment are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers, hospitals and health care professionals for prescription use. The Medical Devices segment includes a broad range of products used in the orthopaedic, surgery, interventional solutions (cardiovascular and neurovascular) and eye health fields, which are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics. New Accounting Standards Recently Adopted Accounting Standards ASU 2018-18: Collaborative Arrangements The Company adopted this standard as of the beginning of the fiscal year 2020. This update clarifies the interaction between ASC 808, Collaborative Arrangements and ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The update clarifies that certain transactions between participants in a collaborative arrangement should be accounted for under ASC 606 when the counterparty is a customer. In addition, the update precludes an entity from presenting consideration from a transaction in a collaborative arrangement as revenue if the counterparty is not a customer for that transaction. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. ASU 2016-13: Financial Instruments - Credit Losses The Company adopted this standard as of the beginning of the fiscal year 2020. This update introduces the current expected credit loss (CECL) model, which requires an entity to measure credit losses for certain financial instruments and financial assets, including trade receivables. Under this update, on initial recognition and at each reporting period, an entity is required to recognize an allowance that reflects the entity’s current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the financial instrument. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. ASU 2018-14: Compensation - Defined Benefit Plans The Company adopted this standard in the fiscal year ended 2020. This standard revised the financial statement note disclosure requirements of ASC 715-20 for defined benefit plan sponsors. The adoption of this standard had no impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for defined benefit plan disclosures. 45 Accounting Standards adopted in the fiscal 2018 with a cumulative effect to the 2018 opening balance of Retained Earnings The following table summarizes the cumulative effect adjustments made to the 2018 opening balance of retained earnings upon adoption of these accounting standards in 2018: (Dollars in Millions) Cumulative Effect Adjustment Increase (Decrease) to Retained Earnings ASU 2014-09 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers $ ( 47 ) ASU 2016-01 - Financial Instruments 232 ASU 2016-16 - Income Taxes: Intra-Entity Transfers ( 439 ) Total $ ( 254 ) Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Adopted as of January 3, 2021 The Company assesses the adoption impacts of recently issued accounting standards by the Financial Accounting Standards Board on the Company's financial statements as well as material updates to previous assessments, if any, from the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019. There were no new material accounting standards issued in fiscal 2020 that impacted the Company. Cash Equivalents The Company classifies all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of three months or less from date of purchase as cash equivalents and all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of greater than three months from the date of purchase as current marketable securities. The Company has a policy of making investments only with commercial institutions that have at least an investment grade credit rating. The Company invests its cash primarily in government securities and obligations, corporate debt securities, money market funds and reverse repurchase agreements (RRAs). RRAs are collateralized by deposits in the form of Government Securities and Obligations for an amount not less than 102 % of their value. The Company does not record an asset or liability as the Company is not permitted to sell or repledge the associated collateral. The Company has a policy that the collateral has at least an A (or equivalent) credit rating. The Company utilizes a third party custodian to manage the exchange of funds and ensure that collateral received is maintained at 102 % of the value of the RRAs on a daily basis. RRAs with stated maturities of greater than three months from the date of purchase are classified as marketable securities. Investments Investments classified as held to maturity investments are reported at amortized cost and realized gains or losses are reported in earnings. Investments classified as available-for-sale debt securities are carried at estimated fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Available-for-sale securities available for current operations are classified as current assets otherwise, they are classified as long term. Management determines the appropriate classification of its investment in debt and equity securities at the time of purchase and re-evaluates such determination at each balance sheet date. The Company reviews its investments for impairment and adjusts these investments to fair value through earnings, as required. Property, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. The Company utilizes the straight-line method of depreciation over the estimated useful lives of the assets: Building and building equipment 20 - 30 years Land and leasehold improvements 10 - 20 years Machinery and equipment 2 - 13 years The Company capitalizes certain computer software and development costs, included in machinery and equipment, when incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use. Capitalized software costs are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the software, which generally range from 3 to 8 years. The Company reviews long-lived assets to assess recoverability using undiscounted cash flows. When certain events or changes in operating or economic conditions occur, an impairment assessment may be performed on the recoverability of the carrying value of these assets. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between 46 the asset’s fair value and its carrying value. If quoted market prices are not available, the Company will estimate fair value using a discounted value of estimated future cash flows. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the goods to customers. The Company's global payment terms are typically between 30 to 90 days. Provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns and discounts to customers are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales. The liability is recognized within Accrued Rebates, Returns, and Promotions on the consolidated balance sheet. Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants, as well as market conditions, including consideration of competitor pricing. Rebates are estimated based on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served. A significant portion of the liability related to rebates is from the sale of the Company's pharmaceutical products within the U.S., primarily t he Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid programs, which amounted to $ 7.2 billion and $ 7.0 billion as of January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019, respectively. The Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through the analysis of wholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally generated information. Sales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals. Sales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in the field, or in specific areas, product recall. The sales returns reserve is based on historical return trends by product and by market as a percent to gross sales. In accordance with the Company’s accounting policies, the Company generally issues credit to customers for returned goods. The Company’s sales returns reserves are accounted for in accordance with the U.S. GAAP guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns reserves are recorded at full sales value. Sales returns in the Consumer Health and Pharmaceutical segments are almost exclusively not resalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the Medical Devices segment are typically resalable but are not material. The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products. The sales returns reserve for the total Company has been approximately 1.0 % of annual net trade sales during each of the fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018. Promotional programs, such as product listing allowances and cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in the same period as related sales. Continuing promotional programs include coupons and volume-based sales incentive programs. The redemption cost of consumer coupons is based on historical redemption experience by product and value. Volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales volumes for the incentive period and are recorded as products are sold. These arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred or recorded as a reduction of revenue. The Company also earns profit-share payments through collaborative arrangements for certain products, which are included in sales to customers. For all years presented, profit-share payments were less than 3.0 % of the total revenues and are included in sales to customers. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further disaggregation of revenue. Shipping and Handling Shipping and handling costs incurred were $ 1.0 billion, $ 1.0 billion and $ 1.1 billion in fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and are included in selling, marketing and administrative expense. The amount of revenue received for shipping and handling is less than 0.5 % of sales to customers for all periods presented. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value determined by the first-in, first-out method. Intangible Assets and Goodwill The authoritative literature on U.S. GAAP requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives be assessed annually for impairment. The Company completed its annual impairment test for 2020 in the fiscal fourth quarter. Future impairment tests will be performed annually in the fiscal fourth quarter, or sooner if warranted. Purchased in-process research and development is accounted for as an indefinite lived intangible asset until the underlying project is completed, at which point the intangible asset will be accounted for as a definite lived intangible asset, or abandoned, at which point the intangible asset will be written off or partially impaired. Intangible assets that have finite useful lives continue to be amortized over their useful lives, and are reviewed for impairment when warranted by economic conditions. See Note 5 for further details on Intangible Assets and Goodwill. 47 Financial Instruments As required by U.S. GAAP, all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Fair value is the exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is a market-based measurement determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The authoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value, with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction. The Company documents all relationships between hedged items and derivatives. The overall risk management strategy includes reasons for undertaking hedge transactions and entering into derivatives. The objectives of this strategy are: (1) minimize foreign currency exposure’s impact on the Company’s financial performance; (2) protect the Company’s cash flow from adverse movements in foreign exchange rates; (3) ensure the appropriateness of financial instruments; and (4) manage the enterprise risk associated with financial institutions. See Note 6 for additional information on Financial Instruments. Leases The Company determines whether an arrangement is a lease at contract inception by establishing if the contract conveys the right to control the use of identified property, plant, or equipment for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Right of Use (ROU) Assets and Lease Liabilities for operating leases are included in Other assets , Accrued liabilities , and Other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. The ROU Assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent an obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Commitments under finance leases are not significant, and are included in Property, plant and equipment, Loans and notes payable, and Long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheet. ROU Assets and Lease Liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of all minimum lease payments over the lease term. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments, when the implicit rate is not readily determinable. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease. These options are included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company has elected the following policy elections on adoption: use of portfolio approach on leases of assets under master service agreements, exclusion of short term leases on the balance sheet, and not separating lease and non-lease components. The Company primarily has operating lease for space, vehicles, manufacturing equipment and data processing equipment. The ROU asset pertaining to operating leases was $ 1.0 billion and $ 1.0 billion in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The lease liability was $ 1.1 billion and $ 1.0 billion in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The operating lease costs were $ 0.3 billion, $ 0.3 billion and $ 0.3 billion in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities were $ 0.3 billion and $ 0.3 billion in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Product Liability Accruals for product liability claims are recorded, on an undiscounted basis, when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information and actuarially determined estimates where applicable. The accruals are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available. The Company accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to defend each matter when those costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. To the extent adverse verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals in the self insurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated. Research and Development Research and development expenses are expensed as incurred in accordance with ASC 730, Research and Development. Upfront and milestone payments made to third parties in connection with research and development collaborations are expensed as incurred up to the point of regulatory approval. Payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related product. Amounts capitalized for such payments are included in other intangibles, net of accumulated amortization. The Company enters into collaborative arrangements, typically with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies, to develop and commercialize drug candidates or intellectual property. These arrangements typically involve two (or more) parties who are active participants in the collaboration and are exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of the activities. These collaborations usually involve various activities by one or more parties, including research and development, marketing and selling and distribution. Often, these collaborations require upfront, milestone and royalty or profit share payments, contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development. 48 Amounts due from collaborative partners related to development activities are generally reflected as a reduction of research and development expense because the performance of contract development services is not central to the Company’s operations. In general, the income statement presentation for these collaborations is as follows: Nature/Type of Collaboration Statement of Earnings Presentation Third-party sale of product & profit share payments received Sales to customers Royalties/milestones paid to collaborative partner (post-regulatory approval)* Cost of products sold Royalties received from collaborative partner Other income (expense), net Upfront payments & milestones paid to collaborative partner (pre-regulatory approval) Research and development expense Research and development payments to collaborative partner Research and development expense Research and development payments received from collaborative partner or government entity Reduction of Research and development expense * Milestones are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to cost of products sold over the useful life. For all years presented, there was no individual project that represented greater than 5 % of the total annual consolidated research and development expense. The Company has a number of products and compounds developed in collaboration with strategic partners including XARELTO ® , co-developed with Bayer HealthCare AG and IMBRUVICA ® , developed in collaboration and co-marketed with Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie company. Separately, the Company has a number of licensing arrangements for products and compounds including DARZALEX ® , licensed from Genmab A/S. Advertising Costs associated with advertising are expensed in the year incurred and are included in selling, marketing and administrative expenses. Advertising expenses worldwide, which comprised television, radio, print media and Internet advertising, were $ 2.1 billion, $ 2.2 billion and $ 2.6 billion in fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Income Taxes Income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and include the results of any difference between U.S. GAAP accounting and tax reporting, recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities. The Company estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on enacted tax regulations and rates. Future changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. The Company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company follows U.S. GAAP which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Management believes that changes in these estimates would not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial position. In 2017, the United States enacted into law new U.S. tax legislation, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). This law included provisions for a comprehensive overhaul of the corporate income tax code, including a reduction of the statutory corporate tax rate from 35 % to 21 %, effective on January 1, 2018. The TCJA included a provision for a tax on all previously undistributed earnings of U.S. companies located in foreign jurisdictions. Undistributed earnings in the form of cash and cash equivalents were taxed at a rate of 15.5 % and all other earnings were taxed at a rate of 8.0 %. This tax is payable over 8 years and will not accrue interest. These payments began in 2018 and will continue through 2025. The remaining balance at the end of the 2020 was approximately $ 7.7 billion, of which $ 6.9 billion is classified as noncurrent and reflected as “Long-term taxes payable” on the Company’s balance sheet. The balance of this account is related to receivables from tax authorities not expected to be received in the next 12 months. The TCJA also includes provisions for a tax on global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI). GILTI is described as the excess of a U.S. shareholder’s total net foreign income over a deemed return on tangible assets, as provided by the TCJA. In January 2018, the FASB issued guidance that allows companies to elect as an accounting policy whether to record the tax effects of GILTI in the period the tax liability is generated (i.e., “period cost”) or provide for deferred tax assets and liabilities related to basis differences that exist and are expected to effect the amount of GILTI inclusion in future years upon reversal (i.e., “deferred method”). In 2018, the Company elected to account for GILTI under the deferred method. The deferred tax amounts recorded are based on the evaluation of temporary differences that are expected to reverse as GILTI is incurred in future periods. The Company has recorded deferred tax liabilities on all undistributed earnings prior to December 31, 2017 from its international subsidiaries. The Company has not provided deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings subsequent to January 1, 2018 from certain international subsidiaries where the earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. The Company 49 intends to continue to reinvest these earnings in those international operations. If the Company decides at a later date to repatriate these earnings to the U.S., the Company would be required to provide for the net tax effects on these amounts. The Company estimates that the total tax effect of this repatriation would be approximately $ 0.7 billion under current enacted tax laws and regulations and at current currency exchange rates. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding income taxes. Net Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities were exercised or converted into common stock using the treasury stock method. Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Estimates are used when accounting for sales discounts, rebates, allowances and incentives, product liabilities, income taxes, withholding taxes, depreciation, amortization, employee benefits, contingencies and intangible asset and liability valuations. Actual results may or may not differ from those estimates. The Company follows the provisions of U.S. GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies. A liability is recorded when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. The best estimate of a loss within a range is accrued; however, if no estimate in the range is better than any other, the minimum amount is accrued. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts the Company’s business and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors including, but not limited to: the magnitude and duration of COVID-19, the extent to which it will impact worldwide macroeconomic conditions including interest rates, employment rates and health insurance coverage, the speed of the anticipated recovery, and governmental and business reactions to the pandemic. The Company assessed certain accounting matters that generally require consideration of forecasted financial information in context with the information reasonably available to the Company and the unknown future impacts of COVID-19 as of January 3, 2021 and through the date of this report. The accounting matters assessed included, but were not limited to, the Company’s allowance for doubtful accounts and credit losses, inventory and related reserves, accrued rebates and associated reserves, and the carrying value of the goodwill and other long-lived assets. While there was not a material impact to the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021, the Company’s future assessment of the magnitude and duration of COVID-19, as well as other factors, could result in material impacts to the Company’s consolidated financial statements in future reporting periods. Annual Closing Date The Company follows the concept of a fiscal year, which ends on the Sunday nearest to the end of the month of December. Normally each fiscal year consists of 52 weeks, but every five or six years the fiscal year consists of 53 weeks, and therefore includes additional shipping days, as was the case in fiscal year 2020, and will be the case again in fiscal year 2026. Reclassification Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation. 50 2. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Current Marketable Securities At the end of the fiscal year 2020 and 2019, cash, cash equivalents and current marketable securities were comprised of: (Dollars in Millions) 2020 Carrying Amount Unrecognized Gain Estimated Fair Value Cash & Cash Equivalents Current Marketable Securities Cash $ 2,863 — 2,863 2,863 — Non-U.S. Sovereign Securities (1) 690 — 690 — 690 U.S. Reverse repurchase agreements 1,937 — 1,937 1,937 — Corporate debt securities (1) 2,674 — 2,674 1,451 1,223 Money market funds 2,102 — 2,102 2,102 — Time deposits (1) 877 — 877 877 — Subtotal $ 11,143 — 11,143 9,230 1,913 U.S. Gov't Securities $ 13,777 1 13,778 4,731 9,047 Other Sovereign Securities 14 — 14 — 14 Corporate debt securities 250 — 250 24 226 Subtotal available for sale (2) $ 14,041 1 14,042 4,755 9,287 Total cash, cash equivalents and current marketable securities $ 13,985 11,200 (Dollars in Millions) 2019 Carrying Amount Cash & Cash Equivalents Current Marketable Securities Cash $ 2,637 2,637 — Non-U.S. Sovereign Securities (1) 439 149 290 U.S. Reverse repurchase agreements 6,375 6,375 — Other Reverse repurchase agreements 375 375 — Corporate debt securities (1) 1,323 889 434 Money market funds 2,864 2,864 — Time deposits (1) 906 906 — Subtotal $ 14,919 14,195 724 Gov't Securities $ 4,102 3,095 1,007 Corporate debt securities 266 15 251 Subtotal available for sale (2) $ 4,368 3,110 1,258 Total cash, cash equivalents and current marketable securities $ 17,305 1,982 (1) Held to maturity investments are reported at amortized cost and realized gains or losses are reported in earnings.

At the end of fiscal year 2019, the carrying amount was the same as the estimated fair value. 51 Fair value of government securities and obligations and corporate debt securities were estimated using quoted broker prices and significant other observable inputs. The contractual maturities of the available for sale debt securities at January 3, 2021 are as follows: (Dollars in Millions) Cost Basis Fair Value Due within one year $ 14,026 14,027 Due after one year through five years 15 15 Due after five years through ten years — — Total debt securities $ 14,041 14,042 The Company invests its excess cash in both deposits with major banks throughout the world and other high-quality money market instruments. The Company has a policy of making investments only with commercial institutions that have at least an investment grade credit rating. 3. Inventories At the end of fiscal years 2020 and 2019, inventories were comprised of: (Dollars in Millions) 2020 2019 Raw materials and supplies $ 1,410 1,117 Goods in process 2,040 1,832 Finished goods 5,894 6,071 Total inventories (1) $ 9,344 9,020 (1) See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details on assets held for sale and the related divestitures for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019. There were no assets held for sale at January 3, 2021. 4. Property, Plant and Equipment At the end of fiscal years 2020 and 2019, property, plant and equipment at cost and accumulated depreciation were: (Dollars in Millions) 2020 2019 Land and land improvements $ 882 854 Buildings and building equipment 12,502 11,877 Machinery and equipment 29,104 26,964 Construction in progress 4,316 3,637 Total property, plant and equipment, gross $ 46,804 43,332 Less accumulated depreciation 28,038 25,674 Total property, plant and equipment, net (1) $ 18,766 17,658 (1) See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details on assets held for sale and the related divestitures for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019. There were no assets held for sale at January 3, 2021. The Company capitalizes interest expense as part of the cost of construction of facilities and equipment. Interest expense capitalized in fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $ 63 million, $ 70 million and $ 86 million, respectively. Depreciation expense, including the amortization of capitalized interest in fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $ 2.6 billion, $ 2.5 billion and $ 2.6 billion, respectively. Upon retirement or other disposal of property, plant and equipment, the costs and related amounts of accumulated depreciation or amortization are eliminated from the asset and accumulated depreciation accounts, respectively. The difference, if any, between the net asset value and the proceeds are recorded in earnings. 52 5. Intangible Assets and Goodwill At the end of fiscal years 2020 and 2019, the gross and net amounts of intangible assets were: (Dollars in Millions) 2020 2019 Intangible assets with definite lives: Patents and trademarks — gross $ 39,990 36,634 Less accumulated amortization 17,618 13,154 Patents and trademarks — net $ 22,372 23,480 Customer relationships and other intangibles — gross $ 22,898 22,056 Less accumulated amortization 10,912 9,462 Customer relationships and other intangibles — net* $ 11,986 12,594 Intangible assets with indefinite lives: Trademarks $ 7,195 6,922 Purchased in-process research and development (1) 11,849 4,647 Total intangible assets with indefinite lives $ 19,044 11,569 Total intangible assets — net $ 53,402 47,643 *The majority is comprised of customer relationships (1) In fiscal year 2020, the Company completed multiple acquisitions and recorded in-process research and development intangible assets of $ 6.0 billion from Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc., $ 0.8 billion for bermekimab and certain related assets from XBiotech, Inc., and $ 0.4 billion from the acquisition of all outstanding shares in Verb Surgical, Inc. Goodwill as of January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019, as allocated by segment of business, was as follows: (Dollars in Millions) Consumer Health Pharmaceutical Medical Devices Total Goodwill at December 30, 2018 $ 8,670 9,063 12,720 30,453 Goodwill, related to acquisitions 1,188 75 2,018 3,281 Currency translation/other ( 122 ) 31 ( 4 ) ( 95 ) Goodwill at December 29, 2019 $ 9,736 9,169 14,734 33,639 Goodwill, related to acquisitions — 1,222 238 1,460 Currency translation/other 600 618 76 1,294 Goodwill at January 3, 2021 $ 10,336 11,009 15,048 36,393 The weighted average amortization period for patents and trademarks is 12 years. The weighted average amortization period for customer relationships and other intangible assets is 21 years. The amortization expense of amortizable assets included in cost of products sold was $ 4.7 billion, $ 4.5 billion and $ 4.4 billion before tax, for the fiscal years ended January 3, 2021, December 29, 2019 and December 30, 2018, respectively. Intangible asset write-downs are included in Other (income) expense, net. The estimated amortization expense for approved products, before tax, for the five succeeding years is approximately: (Dollars in Millions) 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 $ 4,600 4,200 4,100 3,900 3,200 See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to acquisitions and divestitures. 53 6. Fair Value Measurements The Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to manage its exposure to the variability of cash flows, primarily related to the foreign exchange rate changes of future intercompany products and third-party purchases of materials denominated in a foreign currency. The Company uses cross currency interest rate swaps to manage currency risk primarily related to borrowings. Both types of derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges. Additionally, the Company uses interest rate swaps as an instrument to manage interest rate risk related to fixed rate borrowings. These derivatives are designated as fair value hedges. The Company uses cross currency interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges. Additionally, the Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to offset its exposure to certain foreign currency assets and liabilities. These forward foreign exchange contracts are not designated as hedges and therefore, changes in the fair values of these derivatives are recognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the related foreign currency assets and liabilities. The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes, or that contain credit risk related contingent features. The Company maintains credit support agreements (CSA) with certain derivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on respective credit ratings and netting agreements. As of January 3, 2021, the total amount of cash collateral paid by the Company under the CSA amounted to $ 1.1 billion net, related to net investment and cash flow hedges. On an ongoing basis, the Company monitors counter-party credit ratings. The Company considers credit non-performance risk to be low, because the Company primarily enters into agreements with commercial institutions that have at least an investment grade credit rating. Refer to the table on significant financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value contained in this footnote for receivables and payables with these commercial institutions. As of January 3, 2021, the Company had notional amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange contracts, and cross currency interest rate swaps of $ 37.8 billion and $ 30.6 billion, respectively. As of December 29, 2019, the Company had notional amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange contracts and cross currency interest rate swaps of $ 45.3 billion and $ 20.1 billion, respectively. All derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction. The designation as a cash flow hedge is made at the entrance date of the derivative contract. At inception, all derivatives are expected to be highly effective. Foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges are accounted for under the forward method and all gains/losses associated with these contracts will be recognized in the income statement when the hedged item impacts earnings. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income until the underlying transaction affects earnings, and are then reclassified to earnings in the same account as the hedged transaction. Gains and losses associated with interest rate swaps and changes in fair value of hedged debt attributable to changes in interest rates are recorded to interest expense in the period in which they occur. The effect of which are immaterial for the fiscal years ended January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019. Gains and losses on net investment hedge are accounted through the currency translation account within accumulated other comprehensive income. The portion excluded from effectiveness testing is recorded through interest (income) expense using the spot method. On an ongoing basis, the Company assesses whether each derivative continues to be highly effective in offsetting changes of hedged items. If and when a derivative is no longer expected to be highly effective, hedge accounting is discontinued. The Company designated its Euro denominated notes issued in May 2016 with due dates ranging from 2022 to 2035 as a net investment hedge of the Company's investments in certain of its international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their functional currency in order to reduce the volatility caused by changes in exchange rates. As of January 3, 2021, the balance of deferred net gain on derivatives included in accumulated other comprehensive income was $ 652 million after-tax. For additional information, see the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and Note 13. The Company expects that substantially all of the amounts related to forward foreign exchange contracts will be reclassified into earnings over the next 12 months as a result of transactions that are expected to occur over that period. The maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging transaction exposure is 18 months, excluding interest rate contracts, net investment hedges. The amount ultimately realized in earnings may differ as foreign exchange rates change. Realized gains and losses are ultimately determined by actual exchange rates at maturity of the derivative. 54 The following table is a summary of the activity related to derivatives and hedges for the fiscal years ended January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019, net of tax: January 3, 2021 December 29, 2019 (Dollars in Millions) Sales Cost of Products Sold R&D Expense Interest (Income) Expense Other (Income) Expense Sales Cost of Products Sold R&D Expense Interest (Income) Expense Other (Income) Expense The effects of fair value, net investment and cash flow hedging: Gain (Loss) on net investment hedging relationship: Cross currency interest rate swaps contracts: Amount of gain or (loss) recognized in income on derivative amount excluded from effectiveness testing $ — — — 153 — — — — 159 — Amount of gain or (loss) recognized in AOCI — — — 153 — — — — 159 — Gain (Loss) on cash flow hedging relationship: Forward foreign exchange contracts: Amount of gain or (loss) reclassified from AOCI into income 12 ( 329 ) ( 137 ) — ( 16 ) ( 54 ) ( 321 ) ( 105 ) — 22 Amount of gain or (loss) recognized in AOCI 44 298 ( 191 ) — ( 52 ) ( 20 ) ( 606 ) ( 94 ) — 39 Cross currency interest rate swaps contracts: Amount of gain or (loss) reclassified from AOCI into income — — — 370 — — — — 292 — Amount of gain or (loss) recognized in AOCI $ — — — 748 — — — — 417 — The following table is the effect of derivatives not designated as hedging instrument for the fiscal years ended January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019: (Dollars in Millions) Location of Gain /(Loss) Recognized in Income on Derivative Gain/(Loss) Recognized In Income on Derivative Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments January 3, 2021 December 29, 2019 Foreign Exchange Contracts Other (income) expense $ 24 ( 144 ) 55 The following table is the effect of net investment hedges for the fiscal years ended January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019: Gain/(Loss) Recognized In Accumulated OCI Location of Gain or (Loss) Reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income Into Income Gain/(Loss) Reclassified From Accumulated OCI Into Income (Dollars in Millions) January 3, 2021 December 29, 2019 January 3, 2021 December 29, 2019 Debt $ ( 473 ) 121 Interest (income) expense — — Cross Currency interest rate swaps $ 65 488 Interest (income) expense — — The Company holds equity investments with readily determinable fair values and equity investments without readily determinable fair values. The Company measures equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer.

There were $ 21 million and $ 19 million, respectively, of changes in fair value reflected in net income due to changes in observable prices. Fair value is the exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is a market-based measurement determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. In accordance with ASC 820, a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels within the hierarchy are described below with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest. The fair value of a derivative financial instrument (i.e., forward foreign exchange contracts, interest rate contracts) is the aggregation by currency of all future cash flows discounted to its present value at the prevailing market interest rates and subsequently converted to the U.S. Dollar at the current spot foreign exchange rate. The Company does not believe that fair values of these derivative instruments materially differ from the amounts that could be realized upon settlement or maturity, or 56 that the changes in fair value will have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position. The Company also holds equity investments which are classified as Level 1 and debt securities which are classified as Level 2. The Company holds acquisition related contingent liabilities based upon certain regulatory and commercial events, which are classified as Level 3, whose values are determined using discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques for which the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimations. The following three levels of inputs are used to measure fair value: Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. Level 2 — Significant other observable inputs. Level 3 — Significant unobservable inputs. The Company’s significant financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value as of the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019 were as follows: 2020 2019 (Dollars in Millions) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Total (1) Derivatives designated as hedging instruments: Assets: Forward foreign exchange contracts $ — 849 — 849 209 Interest rate contracts (2)(3) — 240 — 240 693 Total $ — 1,089 — 1,089 902 Liabilities: Forward foreign exchange contracts — 702 — 702 426 Interest rate contracts (3) — 1,569 — 1,569 193 Total $ — 2,271 — 2,271 619 Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments: Assets: Forward foreign exchange contracts $ — 49 — 49 23 Liabilities: Forward foreign exchange contracts — 38 — 38 33 Available For Sale Other Investments: Equity investments (4) 1,481 — — 1,481 1,148 Debt securities (5) — 14,042 — 14,042 4,368 Other Liabilities Contingent Consideration (6) $ 633 633 1,715 Gross to Net Derivative Reconciliation 2020 2019 (Dollars in Millions) Total Gross Assets $ 1,138 925 Credit Support Agreement (CSA) ( 1,107 ) ( 841 ) Total Net Asset 31 84 Total Gross Liabilities 2,309 652 Credit Support Agreement (CSA) ( 2,172 ) ( 586 ) Total Net Liabilities $ 137 66 57 Summarized information about changes in liabilities for contingent consideration is as follows: 2020 2019 2018 (Dollars in Millions) Beginning Balance $ 1,715 397 600 Changes in estimated fair value (7) ( 1,089 ) 151 ( 156 ) Additions 106 1,246 125 Payments ( 99 ) ( 79 ) ( 172 ) Ending Balance $ 633 1,715 397 (1) 2019 assets and liabilities are all classified as Level 2 with the exception of equity investments of $ 1,148 million, which are classified as Level 1 and contingent consideration of $ 1,715 million, classified as Level 3.

(4) The excess of the fair value over the carrying value of debt was $ 5.4 billion at the end of fiscal year 2020 and $ 3.0 billion at the end of fiscal year 2019. (5) In the fiscal third quarter of 2020, the Company issued senior unsecured notes for a total of $ 7.5 billion. Fair value of the long-term debt was estimated using market prices, which were corroborated by quoted broker prices and significant other observable inputs. The Company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous banks worldwide. In September 2020, the Company secured a new 364-day Credit Facility. Total credit available to the Company approximates $ 10 billion, which expires on September 9, 2021. Interest charged on borrowings under the credit line agreement is based on either bids provided by banks, London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR), Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) Swap Curve or other applicable market rate as allowed plus applicable margins. Commitment fees under the agreements are not material. Throughout fiscal year 2020, the Company continued to have access to liquidity through the commercial paper market. Short-term borrowings and the current portion of long-term debt amounted to approximately $ 2.6 billion at the end of fiscal year 2020, of which $ 1.8 billion is the current portion of the long-term debt, and the remainder is commercial paper and local borrowings by international subsidiaries. Throughout fiscal year 2019, the Company continued to have access to liquidity through the commercial paper market. Short-term borrowings and the current portion of long-term debt amounted to approximately $ 1.2 billion at the end of fiscal year 2019, of which $ 1.1 billion is the current portion of the long term debt, and the remainder principally represents local borrowing by international subsidiaries.

International operations reflects the impacts of operations in jurisdictions with statutory tax rates different than the U.S., particularly Ireland, Switzerland and Puerto Rico, which is a favorable impact on the effective tax rate as compared with the U.S. statutory rate. The 2020 and 2019 amounts include the impact of the new tax legislation enactment in Switzerland, which is further described below. (2) Includes the impact of the GILTI tax, the Foreign-Derived Intangible Income deduction and other foreign income that is taxable under the U.S. tax code. (3) Represents impact of adjustments to balances originally recorded as part of the 2017 TCJA provisional tax charge. Further information provided below. (4) Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation. The fiscal year 2020 tax rate decreased by 1.9 % compared to the fiscal year 2019 tax rate, which was primarily driven by the following items. In fiscal year 2019, Switzerland enacted the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (TRAF) which became effective on January 1, 2020. The Federal transitional provisions of TRAF allow companies, under certain conditions, to adjust the tax basis in certain assets to fair value (i.e., “step-up”) to be depreciated and amortized resulting in an incremental Swiss tax deduction over the transitional period. TRAF also provides for parameters which enable the Swiss cantons to establish localized tax rates and regulations for companies. The new cantonal tax parameters include favorable tax benefits for patents and additional research and development tax deductions. The cantonal transitional provisions of TRAF allowed companies to elect either 1) tax basis step-up similar to the Federal transition benefit or 2) alternative statutory tax rate for a period not to exceed 5 years. The Company currently has operations located in various Swiss cantons. During the fiscal year 2019, as described in further detail below, the Company recorded the impacts of the TRAF that were enacted in that period. During the fiscal year 2020, the final canton where the Company maintains significant operations enacted TRAF legislation. Additionally, the Company received rulings from the Swiss Federal and cantonal tax authorities in the remaining jurisdictions where it has significant operations. These rulings resulted in the Company revising its estimate on the tax basis adjustment (i.e., “step-up”) for its assets and as a result, the Company recorded additional deferred tax benefits in 2020. The Company recognized a net benefit in the fiscal year 2020 for Swiss Tax Reform of approximately $ 0.4 billion or 2.6 % benefit to the Company’s annual effective tax rate, comprised of the following items: • approximately $ 0.3 billion tax benefit relating to the remeasurement of Swiss deferred tax assets and liabilities for the change in the Federal and cantonal tax rates, where enactment occurred in the fiscal year 2020; this benefit has been reflected as “International Operations” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation. • a $ 450 million deferred tax asset related to the estimated value of a Federal tax basis step-up of the Company’s Swiss subsidiaries’ assets as described above; this benefit has been reflected as “International Operations” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation. • approximately $ 0.3 billion of U.S. deferred tax expense relating to the GILTI deferred tax liability resulting from the remeasurement of the Swiss deferred tax assets and liabilities in the fiscal year 2020. This benefit has been reflected as “U.S. tax on international income” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation. The Company does not expect to receive future rulings regarding the transitional provisions of TRAF. Also, in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2020, the Company recognized a capital loss on certain U.S. affiliates related to the previously impaired book value of certain intangibles, which reduced the 2020 tax rate by approximately 1.2 % which is 61 reflected as a “Tax Benefits on Capital Loss” on the effective tax rate reconciliation. In addition in the fiscal year 2020, the Company had lower income in higher tax jurisdictions, primarily driven by: • the impact of the accrual of litigation costs related to Talc for $ 4.0 billion which reduced the U.S. earnings before taxes at an effective tax rate of 23.5 %; • the accrual of additional legal costs, including an additional $ 1.0 billion associated with a revised agreement in principle to settle opioid litigation at an effective tax rate of 21.4 % The Company also generated additional tax benefits from stock-based compensation that were either exercised or vested; reduced the contingent consideration liability related to the Auris Health acquisition (see Note 18); and reversal of some of its unrecognized tax benefits due to the completion of several years of tax examinations in certain jurisdictions during the fiscal year 2020. The fiscal year 2019 tax rate decreased by 2.3 % compared to the fiscal year 2018 tax rate. In addition to the impact of TRAF discussed in more detail below, the primary drivers of the net decrease were as follows: • The Company reorganized the ownership structure of certain wholly-owned international subsidiaries in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2019, which resulted in a reduction of certain withholding and local taxes that it had previously recognized as part of the provisional Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) tax charge in the fiscal year 2017 and finalized in the fiscal year 2018. Following the completion of this restructuring and approval by the applicable local authorities, the Company reversed a deferred tax liability of $ 0.6 billion and a related deferred tax asset of $ 0.2 billion for U.S. foreign tax credits, for a net deferred tax benefit of $ 0.4 billion decreasing the annual effective tax rate by 2.2 %. This benefit has been reflected as “TCJA and related impacts” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation. • The impact of the agreement in principle to settle opioid litigation for $ 4 billion (see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) which reduced the U.S. earnings before taxes at an effective tax rate of 23.5 % and decreased the Company’s annual effective tax rate by approximately 2.1 %. • In December of fiscal year 2019, the U.S. Treasury issued final foreign tax credit regulations, which resulted in the Company revising the amount of foreign tax credits that were initially recorded in the fiscal year 2017 as part of the provisional TCJA tax charge. As a result, the Company recorded an increased deferred tax asset related to these foreign tax credits of approximately $ 0.3 billion or 1.7 % to the annual effective tax rate. This benefit has been reflected as “TCJA and related impacts” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation. • The Company reassessed its uncertain tax positions related to the current IRS audit and increased its unrecognized tax benefit by $ 0.3 billion liability which increased the annual effective tax rate by approximately 1.5 % (see section on Unrecognized Tax Benefits for additional information). As these positions were related to uncertain tax regarding international transfer pricing, this expense has been classified as “International Operations” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation. Subsequent to December 29, 2019, the Company received and agreed to Notices of Proposed Adjustments (NOPAs) from the IRS. The Company believes it is adequately reserved for potential exposures. • There were several one-time tax impacts that resulted in a cumulative net tax benefit to the 2018 annual effective tax rate of 1.2 %. These items included the LifeScan divestiture, the adjustment to the 2017 provisional TCJA tax charge and the acceleration of certain tax deductions as part of the 2017 tax return. • More income in higher tax jurisdictions relative to lower tax jurisdictions as compared to 2018. As described above for the Swiss tax legislation, in the fiscal year 2019, the Company recorded a net tax expense of $ 0.1 billion which increased the effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2019 by approximately 0.6 %. This net tax expense related to federal and certain cantonal enactments in the fiscal year 2019 consisting of the following provisions: • approximately $ 0.6 billion tax expense relating to the remeasurement of Swiss deferred tax assets and liabilities for the change in the Federal and cantonal tax rates, where enactment occurred by December 29, 2019; this expense has been reflected as “International Operations” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation. • a $ 0.9 billion deferred tax asset related to the estimated value of a Federal tax basis step-up of the Company’s Swiss subsidiaries’ assets; this benefit has been reflected as “International Operations” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation. • approximately $ 450 million of U.S. deferred tax expense relating to the GILTI deferred tax liability resulting from the remeasurement of the Swiss deferred tax assets and liabilities and the new deferred tax asset for the Federal step-up. This benefit has been reflected as “U.S. tax on international income” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation. 62 In the fiscal year 2018, the Company completed its full assessment and finalized the accounting for the impact of the TCJA. The Company recorded net adjustments to the above components of the provisional charge of approximately $ 0.2 billion. These revisions were based on updated estimates and additional analysis by management as well as applying interpretative guidance issued by the U.S. Department of Treasury to the facts and circumstances that existed as of the TCJA enactment date. This charge was primarily related to additional deferred tax liabilities for foreign local and withholding taxes for the remaining balance of undistributed foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017 that were not provided for in the 2017 provisional charge. As described in Note 1, in the fiscal year 2018, the Company elected to treat GILTI as a period expense under the deferred method and recorded a deferred tax cost of approximately $ 1.4 billion in the fiscal year 2018 related to facts and circumstances that existed on the date of TCJA enactment. During 2018, the Company reorganized the ownership structure of certain foreign subsidiaries which resulted in a reduction of certain foreign withholding taxes that it had recognized as part of the provisional TCJA tax charge in the fourth quarter of 2017. Following the completion of this restructuring and as a result of clarification by Swiss tax authorities regarding the applicability of withholding tax to repatriation of certain earnings, the Company reversed a deferred tax liability of $ 2.8 billion and a related deferred tax asset of $ 0.9 billion for U.S. foreign tax credits, for a net deferred tax benefit of $ 1.9 billion. This benefit has been reflected as “TCJA and related impacts” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation.

With respect to the United States, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has completed its audit for the tax years through 2012. As of December 29, 2019, the Company classified unrecognized tax benefits and related interest 63 of approximately $ 0.9 billion as a current liability on the “Accrued taxes on Income” line of the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In the fiscal year 2020, the Company made its final payments for approximately $ 0.7 billion to the U.S. Treasury related to the final settlement of 2010-2012 tax audit liability. In other major jurisdictions where the Company conducts business, the years that remain open to tax audit go back to the year 2006. The Company believes it is possible that tax audits may be completed over the next twelve months by taxing authorities in some jurisdictions outside of the United States. However, the Company is not able to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of any other future tax payments relating to uncertain tax positions. The Company classifies liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties as long-term liabilities, except as previously noted on amounts related to the current United States IRS audit. Interest expense and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax expense. The Company recognized after tax interest expense of $ 32 million, $ 50 million and $ 53 million in fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The total amount of accrued interest was $ 468 million and $ 559 million in fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. 9. Employee Related Obligations At the end of fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, employee related obligations recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were: (Dollars in Millions) 2020 2019 Pension benefits $ 5,761 5,538 Postretirement benefits 2,229 2,297 Postemployment benefits 3,078 3,004 Deferred compensation 250 338 Total employee obligations 11,318 11,177 Less current benefits payable 547 514 Employee related obligations — non-current $ 10,771 10,663 Prepaid employee related obligations of $ 656 million and $ 551 million for 2020 and 2019, respectively, are included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 64 10. Pensions and Other Benefit Plans The Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit, defined contribution and termination indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide. The Company also provides post-retirement benefits, primarily health care, to all eligible U.S. retired employees and their dependents. Many international employees are covered by government-sponsored programs and the cost to the Company is not significant. In the U.S, non-union pension benefits for employees hired before January 1, 2015 are primarily based on the employee’s compensation during the last five years before retirement and the number of years of service (the Final Average Pay formula). U.S. pension benefits for employees hired after 2014, are calculated using a different formula based on employee compensation over total years of service (the Retirement Value formula). In January 2021, the Company announced that, effective on January 1, 2026, all eligible U.S. non-union employees, regardless of hire date, will earn benefits under the Retirement Value formula. This amendment does not affect the benefits accrued under the Final Average Pay formula for service before January 1, 2026. The impact of this change decreases the PBO as of January 3, 2021 by approximately $ 1.8 billion and is included in the “Amendments” line in the Change in Benefit Obligation. International subsidiaries have plans under which funds are deposited with trustees, annuities are purchased under group contracts, or reserves are provided. The Company does not fund retiree health care benefits in advance and has the right to modify these plans in the future. In 2020 and 2019 the Company used December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , respectively, as the measurement date for all U.S. and international retirement and other benefit plans. Net periodic benefit costs for the Company’s defined benefit retirement plans and other benefit plans for 2020, 2019 and 2018 include the following components: Retirement Plans Other Benefit Plans (Dollars in Millions) 2020 2019 2018 2020 2019 2018 Service cost $ 1,380 1,163 1,283 287 274 269 Interest cost 955 1,096 996 133 185 148 Expected return on plan assets ( 2,461 ) ( 2,322 ) ( 2,212 ) ( 7 ) ( 6 ) ( 7 ) Amortization of prior service cost 2 4 3 ( 31 ) ( 31 ) ( 31 ) Recognized actuarial losses (gains) 891 579 852 142 129 123 Curtailments and settlements 23 73 1 — — — Net periodic benefit cost $ 790 593 923 524 551 502 Unrecognized gains and losses for the U.S. pension plans are amortized over the average remaining future service for each plan. For plans with no active employees, they are amortized over the average life expectancy. The amortization of gains and losses for the other U.S. benefit plans is determined by using a 10 % corridor of the greater of the market value of assets or the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation. Total unamortized gains and losses in excess of the corridor are amortized over the average remaining future service. Prior service costs/benefits for the U.S. pension plans are amortized over the average remaining future service of plan participants at the time of the plan amendment. Prior service cost/benefit for the other U.S. benefit plans is amortized over the average remaining service to full eligibility age of plan participants at the time of the plan amendment. 65 The following table represents the weighted-average actuarial assumptions: Retirement Plans Other Benefit Plans Worldwide Benefit Plans 2020 2019 2018 2020 2019 2018 Net Periodic Benefit Cost Service cost discount rate 2.82 % 3.63 3.20 3.04 4.45 3.85 Interest cost discount rate 3.13 % 4.13 3.60 3.08 4.25 3.62 Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00 % 3.99 3.98 4.25 4.29 4.29 Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets 8.12 % 8.31 8.46 Benefit Obligation Discount rate 2.14 % 2.91 3.76 2.23 3.39 4.40 Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00 % 4.01 3.97 4.27 4.29 4.29 The Company’s discount rates are determined by considering current yield curves representing high quality, long-term fixed income instruments. The resulting discount rates are consistent with the duration of plan liabilities. The Company's methodology in determining service and interest cost uses duration specific spot rates along that yield curve to the plans' liability cash flows. The expected rates of return on plan asset assumptions represent the Company's assessment of long-term returns on diversified investment portfolios globally. The assessment is determined using projections from external financial sources, long-term historical averages, actual returns by asset class and the various asset class allocations by market.

This amendment does not affect the benefits accrued under the Final Average Pay formula for service before January 1, 2026. (2) The actuarial losses for retirement plans in 2020 and 2019 was primarily related to decreases in discount rates. (3) In 2019, the Company offered a voluntary lump-sum payment option for certain eligible former employees who are vested participants of the U.S. Qualified Defined Benefit Pension Plan. The distribution of the lump-sums was completed by the end of fiscal 2019. The amount distributed in 2019 was approximately $ 514 million. 67 Retirement Plans Other Benefit Plans (Dollars in Millions) 2020 2019 2020 2019 Amounts Recognized in Net Periodic Benefit Cost and Other Comprehensive Income Net periodic benefit cost $ 790 593 524 551 Net actuarial (gain) loss 2,616 1,084 ( 81 ) 550 Amortization of net actuarial loss ( 891 ) ( 579 ) ( 142 ) ( 129 ) Prior service cost (credit) ( 1,780 ) — — — Amortization of prior service (cost) credit ( 2 ) ( 4 ) 31 31 Effect of exchange rates 293 1 1 1 Total loss/(income) recognized in other comprehensive income, before tax $ 236 502 ( 191 ) 453 Total recognized in net periodic benefit cost and other comprehensive income $ 1,026 1,095 333 1,004 The Company plans to continue to fund its U.S. Qualified Plans to comply with the Pension Protection Act of 2006. International Plans are funded in accordance with local regulations. Additional discretionary contributions are made when deemed appropriate to meet the long-term obligations of the plans. For certain plans, funding is not a common practice, as funding provides no economic benefit. Consequently, the Company has several pension plans that are not funded. In 2020, the Company contributed $ 441 million and $ 429 million to its U.S. and international pension plans, respectively. The following table displays the funded status of the Company's U.S. Qualified & Non-Qualified pension plans and international funded and unfunded pension plans at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively: U.S. Plans International Plans Qualified Plans Non-Qualified Plans Funded Plans Unfunded Plans (Dollars in Millions) 2020 2019 2020 2019 2020 2019 2020 2019 Plan Assets $ 25,554 21,398 — — 12,641 10,803 — — Projected Benefit Obligation 25,466 22,034 2,748 2,544 14,541 12,132 545 478 Accumulated Benefit Obligation 24,158 19,831 2,495 2,115 13,210 11,040 493 430 Over (Under) Funded Status Projected Benefit Obligation $ 88 ( 636 ) ( 2,748 ) ( 2,544 ) ( 1,900 ) ( 1,329 ) ( 545 ) ( 478 ) Accumulated Benefit Obligation 1,396 1,567 ( 2,495 ) ( 2,115 ) ( 569 ) ( 237 ) ( 493 ) ( 430 ) Plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets have an accumulated benefit obligation, projected benefit obligation and plan assets of $ 8.8 billion, $ 9.8 billion and $ 4.4 billion, respectively, at the end of 2020, and $ 4.3 billion, $ 5.2 billion and $ 0.9 billion, respectively, at the end of 2019. The following table displays the projected future benefit payments from the Company’s retirement and other benefit plans: (Dollars in Millions) 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026-2030 Projected future benefit payments Retirement plans $ 1,257 1,292 1,388 1,424 1,494 8,795 Other benefit plans $ 427 440 453 465 417 2,273 The following table displays the projected future minimum contributions to the unfunded retirement plans. These amounts do not include any discretionary contributions that the Company may elect to make in the future.

In determining investment policies, strategies and goals, each committee or board considers factors including, local pension rules and regulations; local tax regulations; availability of investment vehicles (separate accounts, commingled accounts, insurance funds, etc.); funded status of the plans; ratio of actives to retirees; duration of liabilities; and other relevant factors including: diversification, liquidity of local markets and liquidity of base currency. A majority of the Company’s pension funds are open to new entrants and are expected to be on-going plans. Permitted investments are primarily liquid and/or listed, with little reliance on illiquid and non-traditional investments such as hedge funds. The Company’s retirement plan asset allocation at the end of 2020 and 2019 and target allocations for 2021 are as follows: Percent of Plan Assets Target Allocation 2020 2019 2021 Worldwide Retirement Plans Equity securities 66 % 74 % 67 % Debt securities 34 26 33 Total plan assets 100 % 100 % 100 % Determination of Fair Value of Plan Assets The Plan has an established and well-documented process for determining fair values. Fair value is based upon quoted market prices, where available. If listed prices or quotes are not available, fair value is based upon models that primarily use, as inputs, market-based or independently sourced market parameters, including yield curves, interest rates, volatilities, equity or debt prices, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. While the Plan believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. Valuation Hierarchy The authoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels within the hierarchy are described in the table below with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest. The Net Asset Value (NAV) is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, minus its liabilities, and then divided by the number of shares outstanding. A financial instrument’s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the investments measured at fair value. • Short-term investment funds — Cash and quoted short-term instruments are valued at the closing price or the amount held on deposit by the custodian bank. Other investments are through investment vehicles valued using the NAV provided by the administrator of the fund. The NAV is a quoted price in a market that is not active and classified as Level 2. • Government and agency securities — A limited number of these investments are valued at the closing price reported on the major market on which the individual securities are traded. Where quoted prices are available in an active market, the investments are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. If quoted market prices are not available for the specific security, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows. When quoted market prices for a security are not available in an active market, they are classified as Level 2. • Debt instruments — A limited number of these investments are valued at the closing price reported on the major market on which the individual securities are traded. Where quoted prices are available in an active market, the investments are classified as Level 1. If quoted market prices are not available for the specific security, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows and are classified as Level 2. Level 3 debt instruments are priced based on unobservable inputs. • Equity securities — Equity securities are valued at the closing price reported on the major market on which the individual securities are traded. Substantially all equity securities are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. • Commingled funds — These investment vehicles are valued using the NAV provided by the fund administrator. Assets in the Level 2 category have a quoted market price. 69 • Other assets — Other assets are represented primarily by limited partnerships. These investment vehicles are valued using the NAV provided by the fund administrator. Other assets that are exchange listed and actively traded are classified as Level 1, while inactively traded assets are classified as Level 2. The following table sets forth the Retirement Plans' investments measured at fair value as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019: Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets Significant Other Observable Inputs Significant Unobservable Inputs (1) Investments Measured at Net Asset Value (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Total Assets (Dollars in Millions) 2020 2019 2020 2019 2020 2019 2020 2019 2020 2019 Short-term investment funds $ 127 119 763 405 — — — — 890 524 Government and agency securities — — 5,023 4,140 — — — — 5,023 4,140 Debt instruments — — 3,931 3,452 — — — — 3,931 3,452 Equity securities 14,375 12,483 2 2 — — — — 14,377 12,485 Commingled funds — — 4,690 3,338 160 181 8,236 7,580 13,086 11,099 Other assets — — 11 9 21 19 856 473 888 501 Investments at fair value $ 14,502 12,602 14,420 11,346 181 200 9,092 8,053 38,195 32,201 (1) The activity for the Level 3 assets is not significant for all years presented. The Company's Other Benefit Plans are unfunded except for U.S. commingled funds (Level 2) of $ 90 million and $ 84 million at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively and U.S. short-term investment funds (Level 2) of $ 31 million at December 31, 2019. The fair value of Johnson & Johnson Common Stock directly held in plan assets was $ 946 million ( 2.5 % of total plan assets) at December 31, 2020 and $ 984 million ( 3.1 % of total plan assets) at December 31, 2019. 11. Savings Plan The Company has voluntary 401(k) savings plans designed to enhance the existing retirement programs covering eligible employees. The Company matches a percentage of each employee’s contributions consistent with the provisions of the plan for which he/she is eligible. Total Company matching contributions to the plans were $ 243 million, $ 235 million and $ 242 million in fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 70 12. Capital and Treasury Stock Changes in treasury stock were: Treasury Stock (Amounts in Millions Except Treasury Stock Shares in Thousands) Shares Amount Balance at December 31, 2017 437,318 $ 31,554 Employee compensation and stock option plans ( 22,082 ) ( 3,060 ) Repurchase of common stock 42,283 5,868 Balance at December 30, 2018 457,519 34,362 Employee compensation and stock option plans ( 20,053 ) ( 2,691 ) Repurchase of common stock 49,870 6,746 Balance at December 29, 2019 487,336 38,417 Employee compensation and stock option plans ( 21,765 ) ( 3,148 ) Repurchase of common stock 21,760 3,221 Balance at January 3, 2021 487,331 $ 38,490 Aggregate shares of common stock issued were approximately 3,119,843,000 shares at the end of fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018. Cash dividends paid were $ 3.98 per share in fiscal year 2020, compared with dividends of $ 3.75 per share in fiscal year 2019, and $ 3.54 per share in fiscal year 2018. On January 4, 2021, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $ 1.01 per share, payable on March 9, 2021 to shareholders of record as of February 23, 2021. On December 17, 2018, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program, authorizing the Company to purchase up to $ 5.0 billion of the Company's shares of common stock. This share repurchase program was completed as of September 29, 2019. 13. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) Components of other comprehensive income (loss) consist of the following: (Dollars in Millions) Foreign Currency Translation Gain/(Loss) On Securities Employee Benefit Plans Gain/ (Loss) On Derivatives & Hedges Total Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) December 31, 2017 $ ( 7,351 ) 232 ( 6,150 ) 70 ( 13,199 ) Cumulative adjustment to retained earnings ( 232 ) (1) ( 232 ) Net 2018 changes ( 1,518 ) — ( 8 ) ( 265 ) ( 1,791 ) December 30, 2018 ( 8,869 ) — ( 6,158 ) ( 195 ) ( 15,222 ) Net 2019 changes 164 — ( 733 ) ( 100 ) ( 669 ) December 29, 2019 ( 8,705 ) — ( 6,891 ) ( 295 ) ( 15,891 ) Net 2020 changes ( 233 ) 1 ( 66 ) 947 649 January 3, 2021 $ ( 8,938 ) 1 ( 6,957 ) 652 ( 15,242 ) (1) Per the adoption of ASU 2016-01- Financial Instruments Amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income are presented net of the related tax impact. Foreign currency translation is not adjusted for income taxes where it relates to permanent investments in international subsidiaries. For additional details on comprehensive income see the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Details on reclassifications out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income: Gain/(Loss) On Securities - reclassifications released to Other (income) expense, net. Employee Benefit Plans - reclassifications are included in net periodic benefit cost. See Note 10 for additional details. Gain/(Loss) On Derivatives & Hedges - reclassifications to earnings are recorded in the same account as the hedged transaction. See Note 6 for additional details. 71 14. International Currency Translation For translation of its subsidiaries operating in non-U.S. Dollar currencies, the Company has determined that the local currencies of its international subsidiaries are the functional currencies except those in highly inflationary economies, which are defined as those which have had compound cumulative rates of inflation of 100% or more during the past three years, or where a substantial portion of its cash flows are not in the local currency. For the majority of the Company's subsidiaries the local currency is the functional currency. In consolidating international subsidiaries, balance sheet currency effects are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. The other current and non current assets line within the Statement of Cash flows includes the impact of foreign currency translation. This equity account includes the results of translating certain balance sheet assets and liabilities at current exchange rates and some accounts at historical rates, except for those located in highly inflationary economies, (Argentina and Venezuela). The translation of balance sheet accounts for highly inflationary economies are reflected in the operating results. A rollforward of the changes during fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018 for foreign currency translation adjustments is included in Note 13. Net currency transaction gains and losses included in Other (income) expense were losses of $ 209 million, $ 267 million and $ 265 million in fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 15. Earnings Per Share The following is a reconciliation of basic net earnings per share to diluted net earnings per share for the fiscal years ended January 3, 2021, December 29, 2019 and December 30, 2018: (In Millions Except Per Share Amounts) 2020 2019 2018 Basic net earnings per share $ 5.59 5.72 5.70 Average shares outstanding — basic 2,632.8 2,645.1 2,681.5 Potential shares exercisable under stock option plans 118.3 136.3 139.0 Less: shares repurchased under treasury stock method ( 80.4 ) ( 97.8 ) ( 92.5 ) Convertible debt shares — 0.7 0.7 Adjusted average shares outstanding — diluted 2,670.7 2,684.3 2,728.7 Diluted net earnings per share $ 5.51 5.63 5.61 The diluted net earnings per share calculation for fiscal year 2020 excluded 18 million shares related to stock options, as the exercise price of these options was greater than their average market value. As of January 3, 2021, the Company did not have convertible debt. The diluted net earnings per share calculation for fiscal year 2019 excluded an insignificant number of shares related to stock options, as the exercise price of these options was greater than the average market value of the Company’s stock. The diluted net earnings per share calculation for fiscal year 2019 included the dilutive effect of convertible debt that was offset by the related reduction in interest expense of $ 1 million after-tax. The diluted net earnings per share calculation for fiscal year 2018 included all shares related to stock options, as the exercise price of all options was less than the average market value of the Company's stock. The diluted net earnings per share calculation for fiscal year 2018 included the dilutive effect of convertible debt that was offset by the related reduction in interest expense of $ 1 million after-tax. 16. Common Stock, Stock Option Plans and Stock Compensation Agreements At January 3, 2021, the Company had 2 stock-based compensation plans. The shares outstanding are for contracts under the Company's 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan and the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan. The 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan expired April 26, 2012. All options and restricted shares granted subsequent to that date were under the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan. Under the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan, the Company may issue up to 650 million shares of common stock, plus any shares canceled, expired, forfeited, or not issued from the 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan subsequent to April 26, 2012. Shares available for future grants under the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan were 277 million at the end of fiscal year 2020. The compensation cost that has been charged against income for these plans was $ 1,005 million, $ 977 million and $ 978 million for fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The total income tax benefit recognized in the income statement for share-based compensation costs was $ 210 million, $ 227 million and $ 192 million for fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company also recognized additional income tax benefits of $ 248 million, $ 209 million and $ 264 million for fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, for which options were exercised or restricted shares were vested. The total 72 unrecognized compensation cost was $ 804 million, $ 823 million and $ 827 million for fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The weighted average period for this cost to be recognized was 1.76 years, 1.71 years and 1.73 years for fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Share-based compensation costs capitalized as part of inventory were insignificant in all periods. The Company settles employee benefit equity issuances with treasury shares. Treasury shares are replenished through market purchases throughout the year for the number of shares used to settle employee benefit equity issuances. Stock Options Stock options expire 10 years from the date of grant and vest over service periods that range from 6 months to 4 years. All options are granted at the average of the high and low prices of the Company’s Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of grant. The fair value of each option award was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model that uses the assumptions noted in the following table. For 2020, 2019 and 2018 grants, expected volatility represents a blended rate of 10-year weekly historical overall volatility rate, and a 5-week average implied volatility rate based on at-the-money traded Johnson & Johnson options with a life of 2 years. For all grants, historical data is used to determine the expected life of the option. The risk-free rate was based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The average fair value of options granted was $ 16.42 , $ 17.80 and $ 17.98 , in fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The fair value was estimated based on the weighted average assumptions of: 2020 2019 2018 Risk-free rate 1.47 % 2.56 % 2.77 % Expected volatility 15.33 % 16.27 % 15.77 % Expected life (in years) 7.0 7.0 7.0 Expected dividend yield 2.60 % 2.80 % 2.70 % A summary of option activity under the Plan as of January 3, 2021, December 29, 2019 and December 30, 2018, and changes during the years ending on those dates is presented below: (Shares in Thousands) Outstanding Shares Weighted Average Exercise Price Aggregate Intrinsic Value (Dollars in Millions) Shares at December 31, 2017 111,306 $ 90.48 $ 5,480 Options granted 17,115 129.51 Options exercised ( 16,228 ) 75.44 Options canceled/forfeited ( 2,541 ) 112.90 Shares at December 30, 2018 109,652 98.29 3,214 Options granted 19,745 131.94 Options exercised ( 14,785 ) 82.43 Options canceled/forfeited ( 2,975 ) 125.11 Shares at December 29, 2019 111,637 105.63 4,478 Options granted 20,723 151.41 Options exercised ( 16,275 ) 86.05 Options canceled/forfeited ( 1,835 ) 137.62 Shares at January 3, 2021 114,250 $ 116.22 $ 4,703 The total intrinsic value of options exercised was $ 1,021 million, $ 807 million and $ 1,028 million in fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 73 The following table summarizes stock options outstanding and exercisable at January 3, 2021: (Shares in Thousands) Outstanding Exercisable Exercise Price Range Options Average Life (1) Weighted Average Exercise Price Options Weighted Average Exercise Price $ 62.20 -$ 72.54 11,111 1.8 $ 70.79 11,111 $ 70.79 $ 90.44 -$ 100.06 22,304 3.6 $ 95.36 22,304 $ 95.36 $ 100.48 -$ 115.67 28,180 5.6 $ 108.64 27,695 $ 108.51 $ 129.51 -$ 131.94 32,553 7.6 $ 130.85 145 $ 130.53 $ 141.06 -$ 151.41 20,102 9.1 $ 151.41 34 $ 151.41 114,250 6.0 $ 116.22 61,289 $ 96.97 (1) Average contractual life remaining in years.

Stock options exercisable at December 29, 2019 and December 30, 2018 were 60,761 at an average price of $ 88.88 and 54,862 at an average price of $ 82.03 , respectively. Restricted Share Units and Performance Share Units The Company grants restricted share units which vest over service periods that range from 6 months to 3 years. The Company also grants performance share units, which are paid in shares of Johnson & Johnson Common Stock after the end of a three-year performance period. Whether any performance share units vest, and the amount that does vest, is tied to the completion of service periods that range from 6 months to 3 years and the achievement, over a three-year period, of three equally-weighted goals that directly align with or help drive long-term total shareholder return: operational sales, adjusted operational earnings per share, and relative total shareholder return. Beginning in fiscal 2020, performance shares were granted with two equally-weighted goals that directly align with or help drive long-term total shareholder return: adjusted operational earnings per share and relative total shareholder return. The number of shares actually earned at the end of the three-year period will vary, based only on actual performance, from 0 % to 200 % of the target number of performance share units granted . A summary of the restricted share units and performance share units activity under the Plans as of January 3, 2021 is presented below: (Shares in Thousands) Outstanding Restricted Share Units Outstanding Performance Share Units Shares at December 29, 2019 16,769 2,174 Granted 5,051 816 Issued ( 6,042 ) ( 702 ) Canceled/forfeited/adjusted ( 780 ) ( 52 ) Shares at January 3, 2021 14,998 2,236 The average fair value of the restricted share units granted was $ 139.58 , $ 121.31 and $ 119.67 in fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, using the fair market value at the date of grant. The fair value of restricted share units was discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the restricted share units during the vesting period. The fair value of restricted share units issued was $ 650 million, $ 586 million and $ 614 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The weighted average fair value of the performance share units granted was $ 160.54 , $ 124.67 and $ 120.64 in fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, calculated using the weighted average fair market value for each of the component goals at the date of grant. The fair values for the sales and earnings per share goals of each performance share unit were estimated on the date of grant using the fair market value of the shares at the time of the award discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the performance share units during the vesting period. The fair value for the relative total shareholder return goal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo valuation model. The fair value of performance share units issued was $ 91 million, $ 119 million and $ 129 million in fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 74 17.

Acquisitions and Divestitures Certain businesses were acquired for $ 7.3 billion in cash and $ 0.4 billion of liabilities assumed during fiscal year 2020. These acquisitions were accounted for using the acquisition method and, accordingly, results of operations have been included in the financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition. The excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired amounted to $ 7.5 billion and has been assigned to identifiable intangible assets, with any residual recorded to goodwill. The fiscal year 2020 acquisitions primarily included: all rights to the investigational compound bermekimab, which has multiple dermatological indications, along with certain employees from XBiotech Inc. (XBiotech), Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Momenta), a company that discovers and develops novel therapies for immune-mediated diseases and the outstanding shares in Verb Surgical Inc., a company with significant robotics and data science capabilities. During the fiscal first quarter of 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of all rights to the investigational compound bermekimab, which has multiple dermatological indications, along with certain employees from XBiotech Inc., for a purchase price of $ 0.8 billion. The fair value of the acquisition was allocated primarily to non-amortizable intangible assets, primarily IPR&D, for $ 0.8 billion applying a probability of success factor that ranged from 20 % to 60 % to reflect inherent development, regulatory and commercial risk for the different indications. The discount rate applied was approximately 16 %. XBiotech may be eligible to receive additional payments upon the receipt of certain commercialization authorizations. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination and included in the Pharmaceutical segment. Additionally, in the fiscal first quarter of 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of all outstanding shares in Verb Surgical Inc., a company with significant robotics and data science capabilities, including those shares previously held by Verily. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination and included in the Medical Devices segment. The fair value of the acquisition was allocated primarily to non-amortizable intangible assets, primarily IPR&D, for $ 0.4 billion, goodwill for $ 0.2 billion, other assets of $ 0.2 billion and liabilities assumed of $ 0.3 billion. The fair value of the Company's previously held equity investment in Verb Surgical Inc. was $ 0.4 billion. On October 1, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of Momenta for a purchase price of approximately $ 6.1 billion, net of cash acquired. The fair value of the acquisition was allocated primarily to non-amortizable intangible assets (IPR&D) of $ 6.0 billion, goodwill of $ 1.2 billion, other assets of $ 0.5 billion and liabilities of $ 1.6 billion. The assets acquired are intended to address substantial unmet medical need in maternal-fetal disorders, neuro-inflammatory disorders, rheumatology, dermatology and autoimmune hematology. Depending on the asset, probability of success factors ranging from 20 % to 77 % were used in the fair value calculation to reflect inherent development and regulatory risk of the IPR&D. The discount rate applied was approximately 13 %. The goodwill is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise from the business acquisition and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination and included in the Pharmaceutical segment. 82 During fiscal year 2019 certain businesses were acquired for $ 5.8 billion in cash and $ 1.4 billion of liabilities assumed. These acquisitions were accounted for using the acquisition method and, accordingly, results of operations have been included in the financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition. The excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired amounted to $ 6.8 billion and has been assigned to identifiable intangible assets, with any residual recorded to goodwill. The fiscal year 2019 acquisitions primarily included DR. CI:LABO, a Japanese company focused on the marketing, development and distribution of a broad range of dermocosmetic, cosmetic and skincare products and Auris Health, Inc. a privately held developer of robotic technologies, initially focused in lung cancer, with an FDA-cleared platform currently used in bronchoscopic diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. On January 17, 2019, the Company acquired DR. CI:LABO, a Japanese company focused on the marketing, development and distribution of a broad range of dermocosmetic, cosmetic and skincare products for a total purchase price of approximately ¥ 230 billion, which equates to approximately $ 2.1 billion, using the exchange rate of 109.06 Japanese Yen to each U.S. Dollar on January 16, 2019. Additionally, in the fiscal first quarter of 2019, the Company recognized a pre-tax gain recorded in Other (income) expense, net, of approximately $ 0.3 billion related to the Company's previously held equity investment in DR. CI:LABO. The Company treated this transaction as a business combination and included it in the Consumer Health segment. During the fiscal first quarter of 2020, the Company finalized the purchase price allocation. The final fair value of the acquisition was allocated primarily to amortizable intangible assets for $ 1.5 billion, goodwill for $ 1.2 billion and liabilities of $ 0.4 billion. The amortizable intangible assets were comprised of brand/trademarks and customer relationships with a weighted average life of 15.3 years The goodwill is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise from the business acquisition and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. On April 1, 2019 the Company completed the acquisition of Auris Health, Inc. for approximately $ 3.4 billion, net of cash acquired. Additional contingent payments of up to $ 2.35 billion, in the aggregate, may be payable upon reaching certain predetermined milestones. Auris Health was a privately held developer of robotic technologies, initially focused in lung cancer, with an FDA-cleared platform currently used in bronchoscopic diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. The Company treated this transaction as a business combination and included it in the Medical Devices segment. The fair value of the acquisition was allocated primarily to amortizable and non-amortizable intangible assets, primarily IPR&D for $ 3.0 billion, goodwill for $ 2.0 billion, marketable securities of $ 0.2 billion and liabilities assumed of $ 1.8 billion, which includes the fair value of the contingent payments mentioned above. During the fiscal second quarter of 2020, the Company finalized the purchase price allocation. During fiscal 2020, the Company recorded Other income of approximately $ 1.1 billion for the reversal of all of the contingent consideration related to the timing of certain developmental and commercial milestones, which are not expected to be met based on the Company’s current timelines. During the fiscal third quarter of 2020, the Company recorded a partial IPR&D impairment charge of $ 0.1 billion related to timing and progression of the digital surgery platforms. A probability of success factor ranging from 55 % to 95 % was used in the fair value calculation to reflect inherent regulatory and commercial risk of the contingent payments and IPR&D. The discount rate applied was approximately 10 %. The goodwill is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise from the business acquisition and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. During fiscal year 2018 certain businesses were acquired for $ 0.9 billion in cash and $ 0.1 billion of liabilities assumed. These acquisitions were accounted for using the acquisition method and, accordingly, results of operations have been included in the financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition. The excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired amounted to $ 1.0 billion and has been assigned to identifiable intangible assets, with any residual recorded to goodwill. In accordance with U.S. GAAP standards related to business combinations, and goodwill and other intangible assets, supplemental pro forma information for fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018 is not provided, as the impact of the aforementioned acquisitions did not have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position. Divestitures Subsequent to fiscal 2020, in separate transactions, the Company divested two brands outside the U.S. within the Pharmaceutical segment and received combined proceeds of approximately $ 0.6 billion. The Company will reflect these brand divestitures in its 2021 financial results. During fiscal year 2020, the Company sold 11.8 million shares of Idorsia LTD (Idorsia), or its 8.3 % ownership in the company. The transaction resulted in gross proceeds of approximately CHF 337 million ($ 357 million) based on a sales price of CHF 28.55 /share and an immaterial net loss. The Company currently has rights to at least an additional 38.7 million shares (or approximately 20 % of Idorsia equity) through a convertible loan with a principal amount of CHF 445 million (due June 2027). Idorsia also has access to an approximate CHF 243 million credit facility with the Company. As of January 3, 2021, Idorsia has not made any draw-downs under the credit facility. During fiscal year 2019, the Company divested its ASP business to Fortive Corporation for an aggregate value of approximately $ 2.8 billion, consisting of $ 2.7 billion of cash proceeds and $ 0.1 billion of retained net receivables. The Company recognized a pre-tax gain recorded in Other ( income) expense, net, of approximately $ 2.0 billion. 83 During fiscal year 2018, the Company divested the LifeScan Inc business for approximately $ 2.1 billion and retained certain net liabilities. Other divestitures in fiscal year 2018 included: NIZORAL ® , RoC ® and certain non-strategic Pharmaceutical products. In 2018, the pre-tax gains on the divestitures were approximately $ 1.2 billion. In fiscal year 2018, the Company accepted a binding offer to form a strategic collaboration with Jabil Inc., one of the world’s leading manufacturing services providers for health care products and technology products. The Company is expanding a 12-year relationship with Jabil to produce a range of products within the Ethicon Endo-Surgery and DePuy Synthes businesses. This transaction includes the transfer of employees and manufacturing sites. The transfers were completed in fiscal year 2020. As of January 3, 2021, there were no assets held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of December 29, 2019, the assets held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheet were $ 0.1 billion of inventory and property, plant and equipment, net. For additional details on the global supply chain restructuring see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 19. Legal Proceedings Johnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product liability; intellectual property; commercial; supplier indemnification and other matters; governmental investigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of their business. Due to the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, certain trials have been rescheduled or delayed. The Company continues to monitor its legal proceedings as the situation evolves. The Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of January 3, 2021, the Company has determined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal issue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance with ASC 450-20-25. For these and other litigation and regulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors including, among other things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and unpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements; complexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. To the extent adverse verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated. In the Company's opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with counsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company's balance sheet, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position. However, the resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and cash flows for that period. PRODUCT LIABILITY Johnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in numerous product liability claims and lawsuits involving multiple products. Claimants in these cases seek substantial compensatory and, where available, punitive damages. While the Company believes it has substantial defenses, it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation. From time to time, even if it has substantial defenses, the Company considers isolated settlements based on a variety of circumstances. The Company has established accruals for product liability claims and lawsuits in compliance with ASC 450-20 based on currently available information, which in some cases may be limited. The Company accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to defend each matter when those costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. For certain of these matters, the Company has accrued additional amounts such as estimated costs associated with settlements, damages and other losses. Product liability accruals can represent projected product liability for thousands of claims around the world, each in different litigation environments and with different fact patterns. Changes to the accruals may be required in the future as additional information becomes available. The most significant of these cases include: the DePuy ASR™ XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR™ Hip Resurfacing System; the PINNACLE ® Acetabular Cup System; pelvic meshes; RISPERDAL ® ; XARELTO ® ; body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSONS ® Baby Powder; INVOKANA ® ; and ETHICON PHYSIOMESH ® Flexible Composite Mesh. As of January 3, 2021, in the United States there were approximately 560 plaintiffs with direct claims in pending lawsuits regarding 84 injuries allegedly due to the DePuy ASR™ XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR™ Hip Resurfacing System; 7,800 with respect to the PINNACLE ® Acetabular Cup System; 14,900 with respect to pelvic meshes; 9,300 with respect to RISPERDAL ® ; 12,600 with respect to XARELTO ® ; 25,000 with respect to body powders containing talc; 300 with respect to INVOKANA ® ; and 4,200 with respect to ETHICON PHYSIOMESH ® Flexible Composite Mesh. In August 2010, DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. (DePuy) announced a worldwide voluntary recall of its ASR ™ XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR ™ Hip Resurfacing System used in hip replacement surgery. Claims for personal injury have been made against DePuy and Johnson & Johnson. The number of pending lawsuits is expected to fluctuate as certain lawsuits are settled or dismissed and additional lawsuits are filed. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. Litigation has also been filed in countries outside of the United States, primarily in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Ireland, Germany, India and Italy. In November 2013, DePuy reached an agreement with a Court-appointed committee of lawyers representing ASR Hip System plaintiffs to establish a program to settle claims with eligible ASR Hip patients in the United States who had surgery to replace their ASR Hips, known as revision surgery, as of August 31, 2013. DePuy reached additional agreements in February 2015 and March 2017, which further extended the settlement program to include ASR Hip patients who had revision surgeries after August 31, 2013 and prior to February 15, 2017. This settlement program has resolved more than 10,000 claims, therefore bringing to resolution significant ASR Hip litigation activity in the United States. However, lawsuits in the United States remain, and the settlement program does not address litigation outside of the United States. In Australia, a class action settlement was reached that resolved the claims of the majority of ASR Hip patients in that country. In Canada, the Company has reached agreements to settle the class actions filed in that country . The Company continues to receive information with respect to potential additional costs associated with this recall on a worldwide basis. The Company has established accruals for the costs associated with the United States settlement program and DePuy ASR ™ Hip-related product liability litigation. Claims for personal injury have also been made against DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. and Johnson & Johnson (collectively, DePuy) relating to the PINNACLE ® Acetabular Cup System used in hip replacement surgery. Product liability lawsuits continue to be filed, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas. Litigation has also been filed in some state courts and in countries outside of the United States. Several adverse verdicts have been rendered against DePuy, one of which was reversed on appeal and remanded for retrial. During the first quarter of 2019, DePuy established a United States settlement program to resolve these cases. As part of the settlement program, adverse verdicts have been settled. The Company has established an accrual for product liability litigation associated with the PINNACLE ® Acetabular Cup System and the related settlement program. Claims for personal injury have been made against Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon) and Johnson & Johnson arising out of Ethicon's pelvic mesh devices used to treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. The Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and additional cases. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States had been organized as a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia. The MDL Court is remanding cases for trial to the jurisdictions where the case was originally filed and additional pelvic mesh lawsuits have been filed, and remain, outside of the MDL. The Company has settled or otherwise resolved a majority of the United States cases and the estimated costs associated with these settlements and the remaining cases are reflected in the Company's accruals. In addition, class actions and individual personal injury cases or claims have been commenced in various countries outside of the United States, including claims and cases in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and class actions in Israel, Australia and Canada, seeking damages for alleged injury resulting from Ethicon's pelvic mesh devices. In November 2019, the Federal Court of Australia issued a judgment regarding its findings with respect to liability in relation to the three Lead Applicants and generally in relation to the design, manufacture, pre and post-market assessments and testing, and supply and promotion of the devices in Australia used to treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. In March 2020, the Court entered damages awards to the three Lead Applicants. The Company is appealing the decision. With respect to other group members, there will be an individual case assessment process which will require proof of use and causally related loss. The form of the individual case assessment process has not yet been determined by the Court. The class actions in Canada were discontinued in 2020 as a result of a settlement of a group of cases. The Company has established accruals with respect to product liability litigation associated with Ethicon's pelvic mesh product s. Following a June 2016 worldwide market withdrawal of ETHICON PHYSIOMESH ® Flexible Composite Mesh, claims for personal injury have been made against Ethicon, Inc. and Johnson & Johnson alleging personal injury arising out of the use of this hernia mesh device. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. A multi-county litigation (MCL) has also been formed in New Jersey state court and assigned to Atlantic County for cases pending in New Jersey. In addition to the matters in the MDL and MCL, there are additional lawsuits pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, which are part of the MDL for polypropylene mesh devices manufactured by C.R. Bard, Inc., and lawsuits pending outside the United States. Discovery is proceeding in these cases and certain of the cases are in preparation for trials. 85 Claims have also been filed against Ethicon and Johnson & Johnson alleging personal injuries arising from the PROCEED ® Mesh and PROCEED ® Ventral Patch hernia mesh products. In March 2019, the New Jersey Supreme Court entered an order consolidating these cases pending in New Jersey as an MCL in Atlantic County Superior Court. Additional cases have been filed in various federal and state courts in the US, and in jurisdictions outside the US. Discovery is underway in these cases. In September 2019, plaintiffs’ attorney filed an application with the New Jersey Supreme Court seeking centralized management of 107 PROLENE™ Polypropylene Hernia System (“PHS”) cases. The New Jersey Supreme Court granted plaintiffs application in January 2020 and those cases have also been transferred to an MCL in Atlantic County Superior Court. Discovery is underway in these cases. The Company has established accruals with respect to product liability litigation associated with ETHICON PHYSIOMESH ® Flexible Composite Mesh, PROCEED ® Mesh and PROCEED ® Ventral Patch, and PROLENE™ Polypropylene Hernia System products. Claims for personal injury have been made against Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Johnson & Johnson arising out of the use of RISPERDAL ® , and related compounds, indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia, acute manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder and irritability associated with autism. Lawsuits have been primarily filed in state courts in Pennsylvania, California, and Missouri. Other actions are pending in various courts in the United States and Canada. Product liability lawsuits continue to be filed, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. The Company has successfully defended a number of these cases but there have been verdicts against the Company, including a verdict in October 2019 of $ 8.0 billion of punitive damages related to one single plaintiff which was subsequently reduced in January 2020 to $ 6.8 million by the trial judge. The Company and plaintiff are each appealing this judgment. The Company has settled or otherwise resolved many of the United States cases and the costs associated with these settlements are reflected in the Company's accruals. Claims for personal injury arising out of the use of XARELTO ® , an oral anticoagulant, have been made against Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI); Johnson & Johnson (J&J); and JPI’s collaboration partner for XARELTO ® , Bayer AG and certain of its affiliates. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. In addition, cases have been filed in state courts across the United States. Many of these cases were consolidated into a state mass tort litigation in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and in a coordinated proceeding in Los Angeles, California. Class action lawsuits also have been filed in Canada. In March 2019, JPI and J&J announced an agreement in principle to the settle the XARELTO ® cases in the United States; the settlement agreement was executed in May 2019, the settlement became final in December 2019, and the settlement was funded in January 2020. This resolved the majority of cases pending in the United States. The Company has established accruals for its costs associated with the United States settlement program and XARELTO ® related product liability litigation. Personal injury claims alleging that talc causes cancer have been made against Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. and Johnson & Johnson arising out of the use of body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S ® Baby Powder. The number of pending personal injury lawsuits continues to increase, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. Lawsuits have been primarily filed in state courts in Missouri, New Jersey and California, and suits have also been filed outside the United States. The majority of cases are pending in federal court, organized into a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. In the MDL, the parties sought to exclude experts through Daubert motions. In April 2020, the Court issued rulings that limit the scope of testimony, including some theories and testing methods, for certain plaintiff expert witnesses and denied plaintiffs’ attempt to limit the scope of testimony of certain of the Company’s witnesses. With this ruling made, case-specific discovery has begun per the Court’s directive. In talc cases that have previously gone to trial, the Company has obtained defense verdicts in a number of them, but there have also been verdicts against the Company, many of which have been reversed on appeal. In June 2020, the Missouri Court of Appeals reversed in part and affirmed in part a July 2018 verdict of $ 4.7 billion in Ingham v. Johnson & Johnson, et al., No. ED 207476 (Mo. App.), reducing the overall award to $ 2.1 billion and, with additional interest as of January 3, 2021, as the Company pursues further appeal, is currently $ 2.5 billion (the Ingham decision). An application for transfer of the case to the Missouri Supreme Court was subsequently denied, and the Company is currently seeking review by the United States Supreme Court. The Company continues to believe that it has strong legal grounds for the appeal of this verdict, as well as other verdicts that it has appealed. Notwithstanding the Company’s confidence in the safety of its talc products, in certain circumstances the Company has and may settle cases. The Company has established an accrual for defense costs and reserves for the resolution of certain cases and claims, including the Ingham decision currently on appeal , in connection with product liability litigation associated with body powders containing talc. In February 2019, the Company’s talc supplier, Imerys Talc America, Inc. and two of its affiliates, Imerys Talc Vermont, Inc. and Imerys Talc Canada, Inc. (collectively, Imerys) filed a voluntary chapter 11 petition commencing a reorganization under 86 the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (Imerys Bankruptcy). The Imerys Bankruptcy relates to Imerys’ potential liability for personal injury from exposure to talcum powder sold by Imerys (Talc Claims). In its bankruptcy filing, Imerys noted certain claims it alleges it has against the Company for indemnification and rights to joint insurance proceeds. The Company previously proposed to resolve Imerys' (and the Company’s) obligations arising out of the Talc Claims by agreeing to assume the defense of litigation of all Talc Claims involving the Company's products, waiving the Company’s indemnification claims against Imerys, and lifting the automatic stay to enable the Talc Claims to proceed outside the bankruptcy forum with the Company agreeing to settle or pay any judgment against Imerys. In May 2020, Imerys and the asbestos claimants’ committee (Plan Proponents) filed their Plan of Reorganization (the Plan) and the Disclosure Statement related thereto agreeing to put its North American operations up for auction which was subsequently amended. The Company has objected to the Disclosure Statement and intends to object to the Plan of Reorganization as currently structured. Additionally, in June 2020, Cyprus Mines Corporation and its parent (Cyprus) filed an adversary proceeding against the Company as well as Imerys seeking a declaration of indemnity under certain contractual agreements. The Company denies such indemnification is owed and filed a motion to dismiss the adversary complaint arguing, among other things, that the Court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over Cyprus’s claims against the Company. The Plan Proponents filed numerous amendments to the Plan and Disclosure Statement to which the Company objected. A hearing on the Plan Proponent’s Disclosure Statement was held in January 2021, and the Court entered an order approving the Disclosure Statement for the Ninth Amended Joint Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization of Imerys Talc America, Inc. and its Debtor Affiliates allowing Debtors to proceed with soliciting votes on the Plan. The Company intends to continue to object to the Plan. A hearing to consider confirmation of the Plan has been scheduled for June 2021. In February 2018, a securities class action lawsuit was filed against Johnson & Johnson and certain named officers in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging that Johnson & Johnson violated the federal securities laws by failing to disclose alleged asbestos contamination in body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON'S® Baby Powder, and that purchasers of Johnson & Johnson’s shares suffered losses as a result. Plaintiff is seeking damages. In April 2019, the Company moved to dismiss the complaint and briefing on the motion was complete as of August 2019. In December 2019, the Court denied, in part, the motion to dismiss. In March 2020, Defendants answered the complaint. Discovery is underway. In June 2019, a shareholder filed a complaint initiating a summary proceeding in New Jersey state court for a books and records inspection. In August 2019, Johnson & Johnson responded to the books and records complaint and filed a cross motion to dismiss. In September 2019, Plaintiff replied and the Court heard oral argument. The Court has not yet ruled in the books and records action. In October 2019, December 2019, and January 2020, four shareholders filed four separate derivative lawsuits against Johnson & Johnson as the nominal defendant and its current directors and certain officers as defendants in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging a breach of fiduciary duties related to the alleged asbestos contamination in body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S ® Baby Powder, and that Johnson & Johnson has suffered damages as a result of those alleged breaches. In February 2020, the four cases were consolidated into a single action under the caption In re Johnson & Johnson Talc Stockholder Derivative Litigation . In July 2020, a report was delivered to the Company’s Board of Directors by independent counsel retained by the Board to investigate the allegations in the derivative lawsuits and in a series of shareholder letters that the Board received raising similar issues. Four of the shareholders who sent demands are plaintiffs in th e In re Johnson & Johnson Talc Stockholder Derivative Litigation .

The Company has established accruals for defense costs associated with ELMIRON ® related product liability litigation. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY Certain subsidiaries of Johnson & Johnson are subject, from time to time, to legal proceedings and claims related to patent, trademark and other intellectual property matters arising out of their businesses. Many of these matters involve challenges to the coverage and/or validity of the patents on various products and allegations that certain of the Company’s products infringe the patents of third parties. Although these subsidiaries believe that they have substantial defenses to these challenges and allegations with respect to all significant patents, there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these matters. A loss in any of these cases could adversely affect the ability of these subsidiaries to sell their products, result in loss of sales due to loss of market exclusivity, require the payment of past damages and future royalties, and may result in a non-cash impairment charge for any associated intangible asset. Significant matters are described below. Medical Devices In November 2016, MedIdea, L.L.C. (MedIdea) filed a patent infringement lawsuit against DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois alleging infringement by the ATTUNE ® Knee System.

Pharmaceutical Litigation Against Filers of Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) The following summarizes lawsuits pending against generic companies that have filed ANDAs with the FDA or undertaken similar regulatory processes outside of the United States, seeking to market generic forms of products sold by various subsidiaries of Johnson & Johnson prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. These ANDAs typically include allegations of non-infringement and invalidity of the applicable patents. In the event the subsidiaries are not successful in an action, or the automatic statutory stay of the ANDAs expires before the United States District Court rulings are obtained, the third-party companies involved would have the ability, upon approval of the FDA, to introduce generic versions of their products to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for the applicable products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. In addition, from time to time, subsidiaries may settle these types of actions and such settlements can involve the introduction of generic versions of the products at issue to the market prior to the expiration of the relevant patents. The Inter Partes Review (IPR) process with the 89 USPTO, created under the 2011 America Invents Act, is also being used at times by generic companies in conjunction with ANDAs and lawsuits, to challenge the applicable patents.

Janssen is seeking an order enjoining Mylan from marketing a generic version of INVEGA TRINZA ® before the expiration of the relevant patent. GOVERNMENT PROCEEDINGS Like other companies in the pharmaceutical, consumer health and medical devices industries, Johnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation by national, state and local government agencies in the United States and other countries in which they operate. Such regulation has been the basis of government investigations and litigations. The most significant litigation brought by, and investigations conducted by, government agencies are listed below. It is possible that criminal charges and substantial fines and/or civil penalties or damages could result from government investigations or litigation. Average Wholesale Price (AWP) Litigation Johnson & Johnson and several of its pharmaceutical subsidiaries (the J&J AWP Defendants), along with numerous other pharmaceutical companies, were named as defendants in a series of lawsuits in state and federal courts involving allegations 93 that the pricing and marketing of certain pharmaceutical products amounted to fraudulent and otherwise actionable conduct because, among other things, the companies allegedly reported an inflated Average Wholesale Price (AWP) for the drugs at issue. Payors alleged that they used those AWPs in calculating provider reimbursement levels. The plaintiffs in these cases included three classes of private persons or entities that paid for any portion of the purchase of the drugs at issue based on AWP, and state government entities that made Medicaid payments for the drugs at issue based on AWP. Many of these cases, both federal actions and state actions removed to federal court, were consolidated for pre-trial purposes in a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, where all claims against the J&J AWP Defendants were ultimately dismissed. The J&J AWP Defendants also prevailed in a case brought by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Other AWP cases have been resolved through court order or settlement. The case brought by Illinois was settled after trial. In New Jersey, a putative class action based upon AWP allegations is pending against Centocor, Inc. and Ortho Biotech Inc. (both now Janssen Biotech, Inc.), Johnson & Johnson and ALZA Corporation. All other cases have been resolved. Opioid Litigation Beginning in 2014 and continuing to the present, Johnson & Johnson and Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI), along with other pharmaceutical companies, have been named in more than 3,100 lawsuits related to the marketing of opioids, including DURAGESIC ® , NUCYNTA ® and NUCYNTA ® ER. The suits also raise allegations related to previously owned active pharmaceutical ingredient supplier subsidiaries, Tasmanian Alkaloids Pty, Ltd. and Noramco, Inc. (both subsidiaries were divested in 2016). The majority of the cases have been filed by state and local governments. Similar lawsuits have also been filed by private plaintiffs and organizations, including but not limited to the following: individual plaintiffs on behalf of children suffering from Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome; hospitals; and health insurers/payors. To date, complaints against pharmaceutical companies, including Johnson & Johnson and JPI, have been filed by the state Attorneys General in Arkansas, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, Washington and West Virginia. Complaints against the manufacturers also have been filed in state or federal court by city, county and local government agencies in the following states: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina; Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin. The Government of Puerto Rico filed suit in Superior Court of San Juan. There are more than 370 cases pending in various state courts. There are over 2,800 federal cases coordinated in a federal Multi-District Litigation (MDL) pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio (MDL No. 2804). In addition, the Province of British Columbia filed suit in Canada. In October 2019, an anti-trust complaint was filed by private plaintiffs in federal court in Tennessee and is pending transfer to the MDL. These actions allege a variety of claims related to opioid marketing practices, including false advertising, unfair competition, public nuisance, consumer fraud violations, deceptive acts and practices, false claims and unjust enrichment. The suits generally seek penalties and/or injunctive and monetary relief and, in some of the suits, the plaintiffs are seeking joint and several liability among the defendants. An adverse judgment in any of these lawsuits could result in the imposition of large monetary penalties and significant damages including, punitive damages, cost of abatement, substantial fines, equitable remedies and other sanctions. The trial in the matter filed by the Oklahoma Attorney General resulted in a judgment against Johnson & Johnson and JPI in the amount of $ 572 million, subject to a final order to be issued by the Court. The Court issued a final judgment reducing the amount to $ 465 million. Johnson & Johnson and JPI have appealed the judgment. The Company believes that it has strong grounds to overturn this judgment. In October 2019 Johnson & Johnson and JPI announced a settlement of the first case set for trial in the MDL with two counties in Ohio. Johnson & Johnson, JPI and other pharmaceutical companies have also received subpoenas or requests for information related to opioids marketing practices from the following state Attorneys General: Alaska, Indiana, Montana, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Washington. In September 2017, Johnson & Johnson and JPI were contacted by the Texas and Colorado Attorney General’s Offices on behalf of approximately 38 states regarding a multi-state Attorney General investigation. In October 2019, the Company announced a proposed agreement in principle that would include the Company paying $ 4 billion as settlement of these matters. In October 2020, the Company agreed to contribute up to an additional $ 1 billion to an all-in settlement amount that would resolve opioid lawsuits filed and future claims by states, cities, counties and tribal governments, for a total of $ 5 billion which has been accrued, subject to various conditions and an agreement being finalized. This agreement in principle is not an admission of liability or wrong-doing and would resolve opioid lawsuits filed and future claims by states, cities and counties. The Company cannot predict if or when the agreement will be finalized and individual cases are ongoing. In August 2019, Johnson & Johnson received a grand jury subpoena from the United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York for documents related to the Company’s anti-diversion policies and procedures and distribution of its 94 opioid medications, in what the Company understands to be part of a broader investigation into manufacturers’ and distributors’ monitoring programs and reporting under the Controlled Substances Act. In September 2019, Johnson & Johnson received subpoenas from the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) as part of an industry-wide inquiry into the effect of opioid prescriptions on New York health insurance premiums. In September 2020, the Company learned that NYDFS filed a statement of charges related to this investigation. From June 2017 through December 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors received a series of shareholder demand letters alleging breaches of fiduciary duties related to the marketing of opioids. The Board retained independent counsel to investigate the allegations in the demands, and i n April 2020, independent counsel delivered a report to the Board recommending that the Company reject the shareholder demands and take the steps that are necessary or appropriate to secure dismissal of related derivative litigation. The Board unanimously adopted the recommendations of the independent counsel’s report. In November 2019, one of the shareholders who sent a demand filed a derivative complaint against Johnson & Johnson as the nominal defendant and certain current and former directors and officers as defendants in the Superior Court of New Jersey. The complaint alleges breaches of fiduciary duties related to the marketing of opioids, and that Johnson & Johnson has suffered damages as a result of those alleged breaches. In May 2020, the shareholder filed an amended complaint challenging the Board’s rejection of his demand. In August 2020, Johnson & Johnson moved to dismiss the amended complaint, and as of December 2020, that motion was fully briefed. In August 2020, another shareholder who sent a demand filed a separate derivative complaint in the same court making similar allegations. In October 2020, the Court granted defendants’ request to reassign the second-filed case to the division where the first-filed case is pending. In December 2019, two additional shareholders who sent demands filed two separate derivative complaints making similar allegations against Johnson & Johnson as the nominal defendant and certain current and former directors and officers as defendants in the United States District for the District of New Jersey. In April 2020, the two federal cases were consolidated into a single action captioned In re Johnson & Johnson Opioid Stockholder Derivative Litigation . In July 2020, the shareholders filed a consolidated complaint. In September 2020, Johnson & Johnson moved to dismiss the consolidated complaint, and in December 2020, the shareholders opposed Johnson & Johnson’s motion. Johnson & Johnson filed its reply in February 2021. In July 2020, an additional shareholder who sent a demand filed a derivative complaint in the same federal court making similar allegations against the same defendants named in the consolidated action. In January 2021, pursuant to an order in the consolidated action, the third case was consolidated into the consolidated action. In February 2021, the shareholders in the consolidated action filed a motion for voluntary dismissal. Other In August 2012, DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc., DePuy, Inc. (now known as DePuy Synthes, Inc.), and Johnson & Johnson Services, Inc. (collectively DePuy) received an informal request from the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts and the Civil Division of the United States Department of Justice (the United States) for the production of materials relating to the DePuy ASR™ XL Hip device. In July 2014, the United States notified the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts that it had declined to intervene in a qui tam case filed pursuant to the False Claims Act against the companies. In February 2016, the district court granted the companies’ motion to dismiss with prejudice, unsealed the qui tam complaint, and denied the qui tam relators’ request for leave to file a further amended complaint. The qui tam relators appealed the case to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. In July 2017, the First Circuit affirmed the district court’s dismissal in part, reversed in part, and affirmed the decision to deny the relators’ request to file a third amended complaint. The relators’ remaining claims are now pending before the district court. In July 2020, the Court ordered the relators to complete discovery by August 2020; the Relators have requested an extension of the August 2020 deadline that DePuy opposed and additional discovery-related motions have been filed by both parties. Additionally, DePuy has requested a schedule for the filing of a motion to strike and to dismiss the relators’ second amended complaint. In October 2012, Johnson & Johnson was contacted by the California Attorney General's office regarding a multi-state Attorney General investigation of the marketing of surgical mesh products for hernia and urogynecological purposes by Johnson & Johnson's subsidiary, Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon). In May 2016, California and Washington filed civil complaints against Johnson & Johnson, Ethicon and Ethicon US, LLC alleging violations of their consumer protection statutes. Similar complaints were filed against the companies by the following states: Kentucky, Mississippi, West Virginia and Oregon. In April 2019, Johnson & Johnson and Ethicon settled the Washington case. The California case started trial in July 2019 and concluded in September 2019. The trial date for the Kentucky case was scheduled for September 2019 but has been adjourned and no new trial date has been scheduled. In October 2019, Johnson & Johnson and Ethicon settled the multi-state investigation with 41 other states and the District of Columbia. In January 2020, the Court in California issued a statement of decision, finding in favor of the State of California, and awarded civil penalties in the amount of $ 344 million. In April 2020, the Court in California denied the Company's motion for a new trial. In August 2020, the Court entered judgment with respect to the penalties of $ 344 million, but denied the Attorney General’s request for injunctive relief. The Company is appealing the penalty judgment. In April 2020, the 95 Company settled the West Virginia. In October 2020, the Company settled with the Attorney General of Oregon. In November 2020, the Company settled with the Attorney General of Mississippi. In December 2012, Therakos, Inc. (Therakos), formerly a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson and part of the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Inc. (OCD) franchise, received a letter from the civil division of the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania informing Therakos that the United States Attorney's Office was investigating the sales and marketing of Uvadex ® (methoxsalen) and the Uvar Xts ® and Cellex ® Systems during the period 2000 to the present. The United States Attorney's Office requested that OCD and Johnson & Johnson preserve documents that could relate to the investigation. Therakos was subsequently acquired by an affiliate of Gores Capital Partners III, L.P. in January 2013, and OCD was divested in June 2014. Following the divestiture of OCD, Johnson & Johnson retained OCD’s portion of any liability resulting from the investigation for activity that occurred prior to the sale of Therakos. Following production of documents to and settlement discussions with the U.S. Attorney’s Office, J&J affiliate Medical Device Business Services, Inc. agreed to resolve claims under the federal False Claims Act and analogous state laws in a settlement announced in November 2020. In the settlement agreement, Medical Device Business Services expressly denied any wrongful conduct. As a result of the settlement, a qui tam complaint filed by two relators pending in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania will be dismissed. Separate settlement agreements with the states participating in the settlement are in the process of being finalized. In June 2014, the Mississippi Attorney General filed a complaint in Chancery Court of The First Judicial District of Hinds County, Mississippi against Johnson & Johnson and Johnson & Johnson Consumer Companies, Inc. (now known as Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc.) (JJCI). The complaint alleges that defendants violated the Mississippi Consumer Protection Act by failing to disclose alleged health risks associated with female consumers' use of talc contained in JOHNSON'S ® Baby Powder and JOHNSON'S ® Shower to Shower (a product divested in 2012) and seeks injunctive and monetary relief. The matter is stayed pending interlocutory appeal of a December 2018 denial of Johnson & Johnson and JJCI's motion for summary judgment. The Mississippi Supreme Court granted J&J and JJCI's request to file an interlocutory appeal of the denial of the motion for summary judgment in late 2019. Briefing is complete and oral argument was held in February 2021. In January 2020, the State of New Mexico filed a consumer protection case alleging that the Company deceptively marketed and sold its talcum powder products by making misrepresentations about the safety of the products and the presence of carcinogens, including asbestos. The State of New Mexico filed an Amended Complaint in March 2020. The Company moved to dismiss certain of the claims in the Amended Complaint, which was granted. The Company then filed a motion for partial judgment on the pleadings in December 2020. Forty-one states have commenced a joint investigation into the Company’s marketing of its talcum powder products. At this time, the multi-state group has not asserted any claims against the Company. Several states have issued Civil Investigative Demands seeking documents and other information. In March 2016, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI) received a Civil Investigative Demand from the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York related to JPI’s contractual relationships with pharmacy benefit managers over the period from January 1, 2006 to the present with regard to certain of JPI's pharmaceutical products. The demand was issued in connection with an investigation under the False Claims Act. The Company has provided documents in response to the demand. In July 2016, Johnson & Johnson and Janssen Products LP were served with a qui tam complaint pursuant to the False Claims Act filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey alleging the off-label promotion of two HIV products, PREZISTA ® and INTELENCE ® , and anti-kickback violations in connection with the promotion of these products. The complaint was filed under seal in December 2012. The federal and state governments have declined to intervene, and the lawsuit is being prosecuted by the relators. In February 2021, the Court stayed the case and ordered mediation. In March 2017, Janssen Biotech, Inc. received a Civil Investigative Demand from the United States Department of Justice regarding a False Claims Act investigation concerning management and advisory services provided to rheumatology and gastroenterology practices that purchased REMICADE ® or SIMPONI ARIA ® .

Subsequently, the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts unsealed a qui tam False Claims Act complaint, which was served on the Company. The Department of Justice had declined to intervene in the qui tam lawsuit in August 2019. The Company filed a motion to dismiss, which was granted in part and denied in part. Discovery is underway. In April and September 2017, Johnson & Johnson received subpoenas from the United States Attorney for the District of Massachusetts seeking documents broadly relating to pharmaceutical copayment support programs for DARZALEX ® , OLYSIO ® , REMICADE ® , SIMPONI ® , STELARA ® and ZYTIGA ® . The subpoenas also seek documents relating to Average Manufacturer Price and Best Price reporting to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services related to those products, as well as rebate payments to state Medicaid agencies. The Company has provided documents in response to the subpoenas. 96 In June 2017, Johnson & Johnson received a subpoena from the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts seeking information regarding practices pertaining to the sterilization of DePuy Synthes, Inc. spinal implants at three hospitals in Boston as well as interactions of employees of Company subsidiaries with physicians at these hospitals. Johnson & Johnson and DePuy Synthes, Inc. have produced documents in response to the subpoena and are fully cooperating with the government’s investigation. In July 2018 the Public Prosecution Service in Rio de Janeiro and representatives from the Brazilian antitrust authority CADE inspected the offices of more than 30 companies including Johnson & Johnson do Brasil Indústria e Comércio de Produtos para Saúde Ltda. The authorities appear to be investigating allegations of possible anti-competitive behavior and possible improper payments in the medical device industry. We continue to actively respond to inquiries regarding the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act from the United States Department of Justice and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. From time to time, the Company has received requests from a variety of United States Congressional Committees to produce information relevant to ongoing congressional inquiries. It is the policy of Johnson & Johnson to cooperate with these inquiries by producing the requested information. GENERAL LITIGATION In March 2018, a purported class action was filed in the Circuit Court Third Judicial District Madison County, Illinois against Johnson & Johnson Consumer, Inc. (JJCI), alleging violations of state consumer fraud statutes based on nondisclosure of alleged health risks associated with talc contained in JOHNSON'S ® Baby Powder. The complaint seeks damages but does not allege personal injury. In October 2020, JJCI moved to dismiss the complaint. In August 2014, United States Customs and Border Protection (US CBP) issued a Penalty Notice against Janssen Ortho LLC (Janssen Ortho), assessing penalties for the alleged improper classification of darunavir ethanolate (the active pharmaceutical ingredient in PREZISTA ® ) in connection with its importation into the United States.

In October 2020, US CBP agreed to not refer the matter to the Office of Chief Counsel at this time, pending resolution of the related Classification Litigation. In December 2013, Janssen Ortho sued the United States in the United States Court of International Trade (the Classification Litigation) seeking a determination that darunavir ethanolate is exempt from duties upon importation into the United States.

In fiscal year 2020, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $ 0.4 billion, which is included on the following lines of the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, $ 0.2 billion in restructuring, $ 0.1 billion in other (income) expense and $ 0.1 billion in cost of products sold. Total project costs of approximately $ 1.3 billion have been recorded since the restructuring was announced. See the following table for additional details on the restructuring program. In total, the Company expects the Global Supply Chain actions to generate approximately $ 0.6 billion to $ 0.8 billion in annual pre-tax cost savings that will be substantially delivered by 2022. The Company expects to record pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $ 1.9 billion to $ 2.3 billion, over the 4 to 5 year period of this activity. These costs are associated with network optimizations, exit costs and accelerated depreciation and amortization. The following table summarizes the severance charges and the associated spending under these initiatives through the fiscal year ended 2020: (Dollars in Millions) Severance Asset Write-offs/Sales Other (2) Total Reserve balance, December 30, 2018 $ 194 — 48 242 2019 activity ( 30 ) — ( 32 ) ( 62 ) Reserve balance, December 29, 2019 164 — 16 180 Current year activity: Charges — 43 405 448 Cash settlements ( 29 ) 24 (4) ( 399 ) ( 404 ) Settled non cash — ( 67 ) ( 13 ) (3) ( 80 ) Reserve balance, January 3, 2021 (1) $ 135 — 9 144 (1) Cash outlays for severance are expected to be substantially paid out over the next 2 years in accordance with the Company's plans and local laws. (2) Other includes project expense such as salaries for employees supporting these initiatives and consulting expenses. (3) Relates to pension related net actuarial losses associated with the transfer of employees to Jabil Inc. as part of the strategic collaboration. (4) Represents gain on sale of an asset The Company continuously reevaluates its severance reserves related to restructuring and the timing of payments due to the planned release of associates regarding several longer-term projects. The Company believes that the existing severance reserves are sufficient to cover the Global Supply Chain plans given the period over which the actions will take place. The Company will continue to assess and make adjustments as necessary if additional amounts become probable and estimable. 100 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Johnson & Johnson Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, of comprehensive income, of equity and of cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended January 3, 2021, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 3, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended January 3, 2021 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 3, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. Basis for Opinions The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 101 Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. U.S. Pharmaceutical Rebate Reserves – Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied. Rebates and discounts provided to customers are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales. The liability for such rebates and discounts is recognized within Accrued Rebates, Returns, and Promotions on the consolidated balance sheet. A significant portion of the liability related to rebates is from the sale of pharmaceutical goods within the U.S., primarily the Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid programs, which amounted to $7.2 billion as of January 3, 2021. For significant rebate programs, which include the U.S. Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid rebate programs, rebates and discounts estimated by management are based on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis, and projected market conditions in the U.S. pharmaceutical market. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to U.S. pharmaceutical rebate reserves - Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management due to the significant measurement uncertainty involved in developing these reserves and the high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and audit effort in performing procedures and evaluating the assumptions related to contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis, and projected market conditions in the U.S. pharmaceutical market. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to U.S. pharmaceutical rebate reserves - Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid, including controls over the assumptions used to estimate these rebates. These procedures also included, among others, (i) developing an independent estimate of the rebates by utilizing third party information on price and market conditions in the U.S. pharmaceutical market, the terms of the specific rebate programs, and the historical experience and trend analysis of actual rebate claims paid; (ii) testing rebate claims processed by the Company, including evaluating those claims for consistency with the contractual and mandated terms of the Company’s rebate arrangements; and (iii) comparing the independent estimates to management’s estimates. Litigation Contingencies – Talc As described in Notes 1 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with legal matters, including talc, when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. To the extent adverse verdicts have been rendered against the Company, management does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated. For these matters, management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts already accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors, including, among other things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and unpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements; complexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. There have been verdicts against the Company for this matter, including a verdict in July 2018 of $4.7 billion, which was reversed in part and affirmed in part by the Missouri Court of Appeals in June 2020, reducing the overall award to $2.1 billion and, with additional interest as of January 3, 2021, as the Company pursues further appeal, is currently $2.5 billion. An application for transfer of the case to the Missouri Supreme Court was subsequently denied, and the Company is currently seeking review by the United States Supreme Court. As described by management, the Company continues to believe that it has strong legal grounds for the appeal of this verdict, as well as other verdicts it has appealed. Notwithstanding the Company’s confidence in the safety of its talc products, in certain circumstances the Company has and may settle cases. The Company has established an accrual for defense costs and reserves for settlement of certain cases and claims, as well as one case currently on appeal, in connection with product liability litigation associated with body powders containing talc. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the talc litigation is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when assessing the likelihood of a loss being incurred and when 102 determining whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss for each claim can be made, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s assessment of the loss contingencies associated with this litigation. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s evaluation of the talc litigation, including controls over determining whether a loss is probable and whether the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, as well as financial statement disclosures. These procedures also included, among others, (i) gaining an understanding of the Company’s process around the accounting and reporting for the talc litigation; (ii) discussing the status of significant known actual and potential litigation with the Company’s in-house legal counsel, as well as external counsel when deemed necessary; (iii) obtaining and evaluating the letters of audit inquiry with internal and external legal counsel for significant litigation; (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assessment regarding whether an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible or probable and reasonably estimable; and (v) evaluating the sufficiency of the Company’s litigation contingencies disclosures. Litigation – Opioids As described in Notes 1 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with legal matters, including opioids, when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. To the extent adverse verdicts have been rendered against the Company, management does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated. For these matters, management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts already accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors, including, among other things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and unpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements; complexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. The Company has been named in numerous lawsuits brought by certain state and local governments related to opioids matters. The trial in the matter filed by the Oklahoma Attorney General resulted in a judgment against the Company in the amount of $572 million which was subsequently reduced to $465 million. The Company has appealed the judgment and, as described by management, believes that it has strong grounds to overturn this judgment. Separately in October 2019, the Company announced a proposed agreement in principle that would include the Company paying $4 billion as settlement of the lawsuits. In October 2020, the Company agreed to contribute up to an additional $1 billion to an all-in settlement amount that would resolve opioid lawsuits filed and future claims by states, cities, counties and tribal governments, for a total of $5 billion which has been accrued, subject to various conditions and an agreement being finalized. As described by management, this agreement in principle is not an admission of liability or wrong-doing and would resolve opioid lawsuits filed and future claims by states, cities and counties. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the opioids litigation is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when assessing the likelihood of a loss being incurred for the judgment against the Company in Oklahoma and when determining whether a reasonable estimate of the range of loss for the proposed agreement in principle to settle opioids litigation can be made, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s assessment of the loss contingencies associated with this litigation. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s evaluation of the opioid litigation, including controls over determining whether a loss is probable and whether the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, as well as financial statement disclosures. These procedures also included, among others, (i) gaining an understanding of the Company’s process around the accounting and reporting for the opioids litigation; (ii) discussing the status of significant known actual and potential litigation and ongoing settlement negotiations with the Company’s in-house legal counsel, as well as external counsel when deemed necessary; (iii) obtaining and evaluating the letters of audit inquiry with internal and external legal counsel for significant litigation; (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assessment regarding whether an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible or probable and reasonably estimable; and (v) evaluating the sufficiency of the Company’s litigation contingencies disclosures. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Florham Park, New Jersey February 22, 2021 We have served as the Company’s auditor since at least 1920. We have not been able to determine the specific year we began serving as auditor of the Company. 103 Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, management is required to assess the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year and report, based on that assessment, whether the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective. Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the reliability of the Company’s financial reporting and the preparation of external financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal controls over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, internal control over financial reporting determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. The Company’s management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of January 3, 2021. In making this assessment, the Company used the criteria established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in “Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013).” These criteria are in the areas of control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communication, and monitoring. The Company’s assessment included extensive documenting, evaluating and testing the design and operating effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting. Based on the Company’s processes and assessment, as described above, management has concluded that, as of January 3, 2021, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective. The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of January 3, 2021 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which appears herein. /s/ Alex Gorsky /s/ Joseph J.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE Not applicable. Item 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures. At the end of the period covered by this Report, the Company evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures. The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Alex Gorsky, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Joseph J. Wolk, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, reviewed and participated in this evaluation. Based on this evaluation, Messrs. Gorsky and Wolk concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Report, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective Reports on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. The information called for by this item is incorporated herein by reference to ""Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting"", and the attestation regarding internal controls over financial reporting included in the ""Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"" included in Item 8 of this Report. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. During the fiscal quarter ended January 3, 2021, there were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required under Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. The Company has not experienced any material impact to its internal controls over financial reporting despite the fact that most of its employees are working remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company proactively took actions to re-evaluate and refine its financial reporting process through additional monitoring controls to provide reasonable assurance that the financial results are reported accurately and timely. The Company continues to monitor and assess the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures. The Company is implementing a multi-year, enterprise-wide initiative to integrate, simplify and standardize processes and systems for the human resources, information technology, procurement, supply chain and finance functions. These are enhancements to support the growth of the Company’s financial shared service capabilities and standardize financial systems. This initiative is not in response to any identified deficiency or weakness in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. In response to this initiative, the Company has and will continue to align and streamline the design and operation of its financial control environment. Item 9B. OTHER INFORMATION Not applicable.

Management and representatives of Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the ""Company"") also may from time to time make forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements do not relate strictly to historical or current facts and reflect management’s assumptions, views, plans, objectives and projections about the future. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as “plans,” “expects,” “will,” “anticipates,” “estimates” and other words of similar meaning in conjunction with, among other things: discussions of future operations; expected operating results and financial performance; impact of planned acquisitions and dispositions; the Company’s strategy for growth; product development; regulatory approvals; market position and expenditures. Because forward-looking statements are based on current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding future events, they are subject to uncertainties, risks and changes that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of the Company's control. Investors should realize that if underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, or known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, the Company’s actual results and financial condition could vary materially from expectations and projections expressed or implied in its forward-looking statements. Investors are therefore cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements. Risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: Risks Related to Product Development, Market Success and Competition • Challenges and uncertainties inherent in innovation and development of new and improved products and technologies on which the Company’s continued growth and success depend, including uncertainty of clinical outcomes, additional analysis of existing clinical data, obtaining regulatory approvals, health plan coverage and customer access, and initial and continued commercial success; • Challenges to the Company’s ability to obtain and protect adequate patent and other intellectual property rights for new and existing products and technologies in the United States and other important markets; • The impact of patent expirations, typically followed by the introduction of competing biosimilars and generics and resulting revenue and market share losses; • Increasingly aggressive and frequent challenges to the Company’s patents by competitors and others seeking to launch competing generic, biosimilar or other products and increased receptivity of courts, the United States Patent and Trademark Office and other decision makers to such challenges, potentially resulting in loss of market exclusivity and rapid decline in sales for the relevant product sooner than expected; • Competition in research and development of new and improved products, processes and technologies, which can result in product and process obsolescence; • Competition to reach agreement with third parties for collaboration, licensing, development and marketing agreements for products and technologies; • Competition based on cost-effectiveness, product performance, technological advances and patents attained by competitors; and • Allegations that the Company’s products infringe the patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties, which could adversely affect the Company’s ability to sell the products in question and require the payment of money damages and future royalties. Risks Related to Product Liability, Litigation and Regulatory Activity • Product efficacy or safety concerns, whether or not based on scientific evidence, potentially resulting in product withdrawals, recalls, regulatory action on the part of the United States Food and Drug Administration (or international counterparts), declining sales, reputational damage, increased litigation expense and share price impact; • Impact, including declining sales and reputational damage, of significant litigation or government action adverse to the Company, including product liability claims and allegations related to pharmaceutical marketing practices and contracting strategies; • Impact of an adverse judgment or settlement and the adequacy of reserves related to legal proceedings, including patent litigation, product liability, personal injury claims, securities class actions, government investigations, employment and other legal proceedings; • Increased scrutiny of the health care industry by government agencies and state attorneys general resulting in investigations and prosecutions, which carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties, including, but not limited to, debarment from government business; • Failure to meet compliance obligations in the McNEIL-PPC, Inc. Consent Decree or any other compliance agreements with governments or government agencies, which could result in significant sanctions; • Potential changes to applicable laws and regulations affecting United States and international operations, including relating to: approval of new products; licensing and patent rights; sales and promotion of health care products; access to, and reimbursement and pricing for, health care products and services; environmental protection and sourcing of raw materials; • Compliance with local regulations and laws that may restrict the Company’s ability to manufacture or sell its products in relevant markets including, requirements to comply with medical device reporting regulations and other requirements such as the European Union's Medical Devices Regulation; • Changes in domestic and international tax laws and regulations, including changes related to The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the United States, the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing in Switzerland, increasing audit scrutiny by tax authorities around the world and exposures to additional tax liabilities potentially in excess of existing reserves; and • Issuance of new or revised accounting standards by the Financial Accounting Standards Board and regulations by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Risks Related to the Company’s Strategic Initiatives and Healthcare Market Trends • Pricing pressures resulting from trends toward health care cost containment, including the continued consolidation among health care providers and other market participants, trends toward managed care, the shift toward governments increasingly becoming the primary payers of health care expenses, significant new entrants to the health care markets seeking to reduce costs and government pressure on companies to voluntarily reduce costs and price increases; • Restricted spending patterns of individual, institutional and governmental purchasers of health care products and services due to economic hardship and budgetary constraints; • Challenges to the Company’s ability to realize its strategy for growth including through externally sourced innovations, such as development collaborations, strategic acquisitions, licensing and marketing agreements, and the potential heightened costs of any such external arrangements due to competitive pressures; • The potential that the expected strategic benefits and opportunities from any planned or completed acquisition or divestiture by the Company may not be realized or may take longer to realize than expected; and • The potential that the expected benefits and opportunities related to past and ongoing restructuring actions may not be realized or may take longer to realize than expected. Risks Related to Economic Conditions, Financial Markets and Operating Internationally • Impact of inflation and fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates and the potential effect of such fluctuations on revenues, expenses and resulting margins; • Potential changes in export/import and trade laws, regulations and policies of the United States and other countries, including any increased trade restrictions or tariffs and potential drug reimportation legislation; • The impact on international operations from financial instability in international economies, sovereign risk, possible imposition of governmental controls and restrictive economic policies, and unstable international governments and legal systems; • Changes to global climate, extreme weather and natural disasters that could affect demand for the Company's products and services, cause disruptions in manufacturing and distribution networks, alter the availability of goods and services within the supply chain, and affect the overall design and integrity of the Company's products and operations; and • The impact of armed conflicts and terrorist attacks in the United States and other parts of the world including social and economic disruptions and instability of financial and other markets. Risks Related to Supply Chain and Operations • Difficulties and delays in manufacturing, internally through third party providers or otherwise within the supply chain, that may lead to voluntary or involuntary business interruptions or shutdowns, product shortages, withdrawals or suspensions of products from the market, and potential regulatory action; • Interruptions and breaches of the Company's information technology systems or those of the Company's vendors which, could result in reputational, competitive, operational or other business harm as well as financial costs and regulatory action; • Reliance on global supply chains and production and distribution processes that are complex and subject to increasing regulatory requirements that may adversely affect supply, sourcing and pricing of materials used in the Company’s products; and • The potential that the expected benefits and opportunities related to restructuring actions contemplated for the global supply chain, including the Company's transaction with Jabil, may not be realized or may take longer to realize than expected, including due to any required approvals from applicable regulatory authorities. Disruptions associated with the announced global supply chain actions may adversely affect supply and sourcing of materials used in the Company's products. Investors also should carefully read the Risk Factors described in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of certain risks that could, among other things, cause the Company’s actual results to differ materially from those expressed in its forward-looking statements. Investors should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and should not consider the risks described above and in Item 1A to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. The Company does not undertake to publicly update any forward-looking statement that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information or future events or developments. PART I Item 1. BUSINESS General Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 132,200 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the health care field. Johnson & Johnson is a holding company, with operating companies conducting business in virtually all countries of the world. The Company’s primary focus is products related to human health and well-being. Johnson & Johnson was incorporated in the State of New Jersey in 1887. The Executive Committee of Johnson & Johnson is the principal management group responsible for the strategic operations and allocation of the resources of the Company. This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities of the Company's three business segments: Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. Within the strategic parameters provided by the Committee, senior management groups at U.S. and international operating companies are each responsible for their own strategic plans and the day-to-day operations of those companies. Each subsidiary within the business segments is, with limited exceptions, managed by residents of the country where located. Segments of Business The Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. Additional information required by this item is incorporated herein by reference to the narrative and tabular descriptions of segments and operating results under: “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition” of this Report; and Note 18 “Segments of Business and Geographic Areas” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.

Key products in the Pharmaceutical segment include: REMICADE ® (infliximab), a treatment for a number of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases; SIMPONI ® (golimumab), a subcutaneous treatment for adults with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis, active psoriatic arthritis, active ankylosing spondylitis and moderately active to severely active ulcerative colitis; SIMPONI ARIA ® (golimumab), an intravenous treatment for adults with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis, active psoriatic arthritis and active ankylosing spondylitis; STELARA ® (ustekinumab), a treatment for adults and children with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, for adults with active psoriatic arthritis, for adults with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease and treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis; TREMFYA ® (guselkumab), a treatment for adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis; EDURANT ® (rilpivirine), PREZISTA ® (darunavir) and PREZCOBIX ® /REZOLSTA ® (darunavir/cobicistat), antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) in combination with other antiretroviral products and SYMTUZA ® (darunavir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide), a once-daily single tablet regimen for the treatment of HIV; CONCERTA ® (methylphenidate HCl) extended-release tablets CII, a treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; INVEGA SUSTENNA ® /XEPLION ® (paliperidone palmitate), for the treatment of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder in adults; INVEGA TRINZA ® /TREVICTA ® (paliperidone palmitate), for the treatment of schizophrenia in patients after they have been adequately treated with INVEGA SUSTENNA ® for at least four months; RISPERDAL CONSTA ® (risperidone long-acting injection), for the treatment of schizophrenia and the 1 maintenance treatment of Bipolar 1 Disorder in adults; ZYTIGA ® (abiraterone acetate), a treatment for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and metastatic high-risk castration-sensitive prostate cancer; IMBRUVICA ® (ibrutinib), a treatment for certain B-cell malignancies, or blood cancers, chronic graft versus host disease and Waldenström's Macroglobulinemia; DARZALEX ® (daratumumab), a treatment for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma; VELCADE ® (bortezomib), a treatment for multiple myeloma mantle cell lymphoma; PROCRIT ® /EPREX ® (epoetin alfa), a treatment for chemotherapy-induced anemia and patients with chronic kidney disease; XARELTO ® (rivaroxaban), an oral anticoagulant for the prevention of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which may lead to pulmonary embolism (PE) in patients undergoing hip or knee replacement surgery, to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, and for the treatment and reduction of risk of recurrence of DVT and PE; INVOKANA ® (canagliflozin), for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes; INVOKAMET ® /VOKANAMET ® (canagliflozin/metformin HCl), a combination therapy of fixed doses of canagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes; and INVOKAMET ® XR (canagliflozin/metformin hydrochloride extended-release), a once-daily, fixed-dose combination therapy of canagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release, for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes; OPSUMIT ® (macitentan) as monotherapy or in combination, indicated for the long-term treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH); UPTRAVI ® (selexipag), the only approved oral, selective IP receptor agonist targeting a prostacyclin pathway in PAH. Many of these medicines were developed in collaboration with strategic partners or are licensed from other companies and maintain active lifecycle development programs. Medical Devices The Medical Devices segment includes a broad range of products used in the orthopaedic, surgery, interventional solutions (cardiovascular and neurovascular) and eye health fields. These products are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics. They include orthopaedic products; general surgery, biosurgical, endomechanical and energy products; electrophysiology products to treat cardiovascular disease; and vision products such as disposable contact lenses and ophthalmic products related to cataract and laser refractive surgery. Geographic Areas Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 132,200 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the health care field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world with the primary focus on products related to human health and well-being. The products made and sold in the international business include many of those described above under “– Segments of Business – Consumer,” “– Pharmaceutical” and “– Medical Devices.” However, the principal markets, products and methods of distribution in the international business vary with the country and the culture. The products sold in international business include those developed in the U.S. and by subsidiaries abroad. Investments and activities in some countries outside the U.S. are subject to higher risks than comparable U.S. activities because the investment and commercial climate may be influenced by financial instability in international economies, restrictive economic policies and political and legal system uncertainties. Raw Materials Raw materials essential to the Company's business are generally readily available from multiple sources. Where there are exceptions, the temporary unavailability of those raw materials would not likely have a material adverse effect on the financial results of the Company. Patents The Company's subsidiaries have made a practice of obtaining patent protection on their products and processes where possible. They own, or are licensed under, a significant number of patents in the U.S. and other countries relating to their products, product uses, formulations and manufacturing processes, which in the aggregate are believed to be of material importance to the Company in the operation of its businesses. The Company’s subsidiaries face patent challenges from third parties, including challenges seeking to manufacture and market generic and biosimilar versions of the Company's key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. Significant legal proceedings and claims involving the Company's patent and other intellectual property are described in Note 21, “Legal Proceedings— Intellectual Property” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Sales of the Company’s largest product, STELARA ® (ustekinumab), accounted for approximately 7.8% of the Company's total revenues for fiscal 2019. Accordingly, the patents related to this product are believed to be material to the Company. 2 There is one set of granted patents related specifically to STELARA ® . This set of patents is owned by Janssen Biotech, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson. These patents are in force in the U.S. and many countries outside the U.S. In the U.S., the latest projected expiration date for patents in this set is 2023 due to patent term extension and adjustment. In most of Europe, the latest projected expiration date for patents in this set is 2024 due to a Supplementary Protection Certificate (patent term extension). In most other countries, the latest projected expiration date is 2021. In addition to competing in the immunology market with STELARA ® , the Company is currently marketing SIMPONI ® (golimumab) and SIMPONI ARIA ® (golimumab), next generation immunology products. Patents related to these products are in force and the latest projected U.S. expiration date is 2024 due to patent term extension and adjustment. The Company also markets REMICADE ® (infliximab) in the immunology market which is the Company’s 2nd largest product. Patents on this product have expired and the Food and Drug Administration approved the first infliximab biosimilar for sale in the U.S. in 2016, and a number of such products have been launched since then. For a more extensive description of legal matters regarding the patents related to REMICADE ® , see Note 21 “Legal Proceedings - Intellectual Property - Pharmaceutical - REMICADE ® Related Cases” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Trademarks The Company’s subsidiaries have made a practice of selling their products under trademarks and of obtaining protection for these trademarks by all available means. These trademarks are protected by registration in the U.S. and other countries where such products are marketed. The Company considers these trademarks in the aggregate to be of material importance in the operation of its businesses. Seasonality Worldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality; however, spending has been heavier in the fourth quarter of each year than in other quarters. This reflects increased spending decisions, principally for advertising and research and development activity. Competition In all of their product lines, the Company's subsidiaries compete with companies both locally and globally. Competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved. Competition in research, both internally and externally sourced, involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. The development of new and innovative products, as well as protecting the underlying intellectual property of the Company’s product portfolio, is important to the Company's success in all areas of its business. The competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research. In addition, the development and maintenance of customer demand for the Company’s consumer products involve significant expenditures for advertising and promotion. Environment The Company is subject to a variety of U.S. and international environmental protection measures. The Company believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations. The Company’s compliance with these requirements did not change during the past year, and is not expected to have a material effect upon its capital expenditures, cash flows, earnings or competitive position. Regulation The Company’s businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which operations are conducted, and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation and enforcement. We are subject to costly and complex U.S. and foreign laws and governmental regulations and any adverse regulatory action may materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operations. In the U.S., the drug, device and cosmetic industries have long been subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies, primarily as to product safety, efficacy, manufacturing, advertising, labeling and safety reporting. The exercise of broad regulatory powers by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the FDA) continues to result in increases in the amounts of testing and documentation required for FDA approval of new drugs and devices and a corresponding increase in the expense of product introduction. Similar trends are also evident in major markets outside of the U.S. The new medical device regulatory framework and the new privacy regulations in Europe and in other countries are examples of such increased regulation. The regulatory agencies under whose purview the Company operates have administrative powers that may subject it to actions such as product withdrawals, recalls, seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions. In some cases, the Company’s subsidiaries may deem it advisable to initiate product recalls. 3 The FDA and regulatory agencies around the globe are also increasing their enforcement activities. If the U.S. FDA were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our drugs or medical devices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, the U.S. FDA could ban such products, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded products, order a recall, repair, replacement, or refund of such products, refuse to grant pending applications for marketing authorization or require certificates of foreign governments for exports, and/or require us to notify health professionals and others that the products present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The U.S. FDA may also assess civil or criminal penalties against us, our officers or employees and impose operating restrictions on a company-wide basis, or enjoin and/or restrain certain conduct resulting in violations of applicable law. The U.S. FDA may also recommend prosecution to the US Department of Justice. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict us from effectively marketing and selling our products and limit our ability to obtain future clearances or approvals, and could result in a substantial modification to our business practices and operations. Equivalent enforcement mechanisms exist in different countries in which we conduct business. The costs of human health care have been and continue to be a subject of study, investigation and regulation by governmental agencies and legislative bodies around the world. In the U.S., attention has been focused by states, regulatory agencies and congress on drug prices and profits and programs that encourage doctors to write prescriptions for particular drugs, or to recommend, use or purchase particular medical devices. There is increased focus on interactions between healthcare companies and health care providers and various transparency laws and regulations require disclosures of financial relationships between companies and health care providers. Payers have become a more potent force in the market place and increased attention is being paid to drug and medical device pricing, appropriate drug and medical device utilization and the quality and costs of health care generally. U.S. government agencies continue efforts to repeal and modify provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the ACA) which passed in 2010. For example, federal legislation repealed the ACA’s individual mandate tax penalty as well as the tax on generous employer-sponsored healthcare plans; CMS began permitting states to impose work requirements on persons covered by Medicaid expansion plans; certain federal subsidies to insurers have ended; and certain short-term insurance plans not offering the full array of ACA benefits have been allowed to extend in duration. Some of these changes are being challenged in U.S. courts and so their long-term impact remains uncertain. The U.S. government also continues to propose and implement changes to the Medicare Part D benefit including the size of manufacturer discounts in the coverage gap and catastrophic phases of the benefit. This changing federal landscape has both positive and negative impacts on the U.S. healthcare industry with much remaining uncertain as to how various provisions of federal law, and potential modification or repeal of these laws, will ultimately affect the industry. In addition, business practices in the health care industry have come under increased scrutiny, particularly in the U.S., by government agencies and state attorneys general, and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties. Further, the Company relies on global supply chains, and production and distribution processes, that are complex, are subject to increasing regulatory requirements, and may be faced with unexpected changes such as those resulting from Brexit, that may affect sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in the Company's products. These processes also are subject to complex and lengthy regulatory approvals. Available Information The Company’s main corporate website address is www.jnj.com.

RISK FACTORS The Company faces a number of uncertainties and risks that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of the Company's control. In addition to the other information in this report and the Company’s other filings with the SEC, investors should consider carefully the factors set forth below. Investors should be aware that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and that the following is not meant to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties. If known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, the Company’s business, results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected, potentially in a material way. Global sales in the Company’s pharmaceutical and medical devices segments may be negatively impacted by healthcare reforms and increasing pricing pressures. Sales of the Company’s pharmaceutical and medical device products are significantly affected by reimbursements by third-party payers such as government healthcare programs, private insurance plans and managed care organizations. As part of various efforts to contain healthcare costs, these payers are putting downward pressure on prices at which products will be reimbursed. In the U.S., increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of Medicare, Medicaid, and private sector beneficiaries, in part due to continued consolidation among health care providers, could result in further pricing pressures. In addition, increased political scrutiny could result in additional pricing pressures. Outside the U.S., numerous major markets, including the EU and Japan, have pervasive government involvement in funding healthcare and, in that regard, directly or indirectly impose price controls, limit access to, or reimbursement for, the Company’s products, or reduce the value of its intellectual property protection. The Company is subject to significant legal proceedings that can result in significant expenses, fines and reputational damage. In the ordinary course of business, Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims and lawsuits involving various issues such as patent disputes, product liability and claims that their product sales, marketing and pricing practices violate various antitrust, unfair trade practices and/or consumer protection laws. The most significant of these proceedings are described in Note 21, “Legal Proceedings” under Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Litigation, in general, and securities, derivative action, class action and multi-district litigation, in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. Some of these matters may include thousands of plaintiffs or may be determined to be class actions and may involve parties seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages, and may remain unresolved for several years. For example, the Company is a defendant in numerous lawsuits arising out of the use of body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSONS ® Baby Powder, and the Company’s sale, manufacturing and marketing of opioids. While the Company believes it has substantial defenses in these matters, it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation. The Company could in the future be required to pay significant amounts as a result of settlements or judgments in these matters, potentially in excess of accruals, including matters where the Company could be held jointly and severally liable among other defendants. The resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and cash flows for that period. Furthermore, as a result of cost and availability factors, effective November 1, 2005, the Company ceased purchasing third-party product liability insurance. Product reliability, safety and effectiveness concerns can have significant negative impacts on sales and results of operations, lead to litigation and cause reputational damage. Concerns about product safety, whether raised internally or by litigants, regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence, can result in safety alerts, product recalls, governmental investigations, regulatory action on the part of the FDA (or its counterpart in other countries), private claims and lawsuits, payment of fines and settlements, declining sales and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in the Company’s products. Product recalls have in the past, and could in the future, prompt government investigations and inspections, the shutdown of manufacturing facilities, continued product shortages and related sales declines, significant remediation costs, reputational damage, possible civil penalties and criminal prosecution. Changes in tax laws or exposures to additional tax liabilities could negatively impact the Company’s operating results. Changes in tax laws or regulations around the world could negatively impact the Company’s effective tax rate and results of operations. A change in statutory tax rate in any country would result in the revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the period in which the new tax law is enacted. This change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The Company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the countries where it operates. Changes to the statutory tax rate may occur at any time, and any related expense or benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted. 6 In fiscal year 2019, Switzerland enacted the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (TRAF) which became effective on January 1, 2020. As of December 29, 2019, certain cantons where the Company operates have not yet enacted portions of the tax reform as stipulated in the Swiss Federal law. These enactments and future possible guidance from the applicable taxing authorities may have a material impact on the Company’s operating results. See Note 8 on income taxes for additional information. The Company conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and is addressing tax audits and disputes with many tax authorities. In connection with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project, companies are required to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in other countries. The Company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of its tax audits and disputes to determine the appropriateness of its tax reserves. However, any tax authority could take a position on tax treatment that is contrary to the Company’s expectations, which could result in tax liabilities in excess of reserves. The Company may not be able to successfully secure and defend intellectual property rights essential to the Company’s businesses. The Company owns or licenses a significant number of patents and other proprietary rights, determined by patent offices, courts and lawmakers in various countries, relating to its products and manufacturing processes. These rights are essential to the Company’s businesses and materially important to the Company’s results of operations. Public policy, both within and outside the U.S., has become increasingly unfavorable toward intellectual property rights. The Company cannot be certain that it will obtain adequate patent protection for new products and technologies in the U.S. and other important markets or that such protections, once granted, will last as long as originally anticipated. Competitors routinely challenge the validity or extent of the Company’s owned or licensed patents and proprietary rights through litigation, interferences, oppositions and other proceedings. These proceedings absorb resources and can be protracted as well as unpredictable. In addition, challenges that the Company’s products infringe the patents of third parties could result in the need to pay past damages and future royalties and adversely affect the competitive position and sales of the products in question. The Company has faced increasing patent challenges from third parties seeking to manufacture and market generic and biosimilar versions of the Company's key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. In the U.S., manufacturers of generic versions of innovative human pharmaceutical products may challenge the validity, or claim non-infringement, of innovator products through the Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, process with the FDA. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA), enacted in 2010, which created a new regulatory pathway for the approval by the FDA of biosimilar alternatives to innovator-developed biological products, also created mechanisms for biosimilar applicants to challenge the patents on the innovator biologics. The inter partes review (IPR) process with the USPTO, created under the 2011 America Invents Act, is also being used by competitors to challenge patents held by the Company’s subsidiaries. In the event the Company is not successful in defending its patents against such challenges, or upon the “at-risk” launch (despite pending patent infringement litigation) by the generic or biosimilar firm of its product, the Company can lose a major portion of revenues for the referenced product in a very short period of time. Current legal proceedings involving the Company’s patents and other intellectual property rights are described in Note 21, “Legal Proceedings—Intellectual Property” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. The Company’s businesses operate in highly competitive product markets and competitive pressures could adversely affect the Company’s earnings. The Company faces substantial competition in all three operating segments and in all geographic markets. The Company’s businesses compete with companies of all sizes on the basis of cost-effectiveness, technological innovations, intellectual property rights, product performance, real or perceived product advantages, pricing and availability and rate of reimbursement. The Company also competes with other market participants in securing rights to acquisitions, collaborations and licensing agreements with third parties. Competition for rights to product candidates and technologies may result in significant investment and acquisition costs and onerous agreement terms for the Company. Competitors’ development of more effective or less costly products, and/or their ability to secure patent and other intellectual property rights and successfully market products ahead of the Company, could negatively impact sales of the Company’s existing products as well as its ability to bring new products to market despite significant prior investment in the related product development. 7 For the Company’s pharmaceutical businesses, loss of patent exclusivity for a product often is followed by a substantial reduction in sales as competitors gain regulatory approval for generic and other competing products and enter the market. Similar competition can be triggered by the loss of exclusivity for a biological product. For the Company’s medical device businesses, technological innovation, product quality, reputation and customer service are especially important to competitiveness. Development by other companies of new or improved products, processes and technologies could threaten to make the Company’s products or technologies less desirable, less economical or obsolete. The Company’s consumer businesses face intense competition from other branded products and retailers’ private-label brands. If the Company fails to sufficiently differentiate and market its brand name consumer products, this could adversely affect revenues and profitability of those products. Significant challenges or delays in the Company’s innovation and development of new products, technologies and indications could have an adverse impact on the Company’s long-term success. The Company’s continued growth and success depends on its ability to innovate and develop new and differentiated products and services that address the evolving health care needs of patients, providers and consumers. Development of successful products and technologies is also necessary to offset revenue losses when the Company’s existing products lose market share due to various factors such as competition and loss of patent exclusivity. New products introduced within the past five years accounted for approximately 25% of 2019 sales. The Company cannot be certain when or whether it will be able to develop, license or otherwise acquire companies, products and technologies, whether particular product candidates will be granted regulatory approval, and, if approved, whether the products will be commercially successful. The Company pursues product development through internal research and development as well as through collaborations, acquisitions, joint ventures and licensing or other arrangements with third parties. In all of these contexts, developing new products, particularly pharmaceutical and biotechnology products and medical devices, requires significant investment of resources over many years. Only a very few biopharmaceutical research and development programs result in commercially viable products. The process depends on many factors including the ability to discern patients’ and health care providers’ future needs; develop promising new compounds, strategies and technologies; achieve successful clinical trial results; secure effective intellectual property protection; obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis; and, if and when they reach the market, successfully differentiate the Company’s products from competing products and approaches to treatment. New products or enhancements to existing products may not be accepted quickly or significantly in the marketplace due to product and price competition, changes in customer preferences or healthcare purchasing patterns, resistance by healthcare providers or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. Even following initial regulatory approval, the success of a product can be adversely impacted by safety and efficacy findings in larger real world patient populations, as well as market entry of competitive products. The Company faces increasing regulatory scrutiny which imposes significant compliance costs and exposes the Company to government investigations, legal actions and penalties. Like other companies in the healthcare industry, the Company is subject to extensive regulation, investigations and legal action, by national, state and local government agencies in the U.S. and other countries in which they operate. Regulatory issues regarding compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) (and comparable quality regulations in foreign countries) by manufacturers of drugs, devices and consumer products can lead to fines and penalties, product recalls, product shortages, interruptions in production, delays in new product approvals and litigation. In addition, the marketing, pricing and sale of the Company’s products are subject to regulation, investigations and legal actions including under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Medicaid Rebate Program, federal and state false claims acts, state unfair trade practices acts and consumer protection laws. Increased scrutiny of health care industry business practices in recent years by government agencies and state attorneys general in the U.S., and any resulting investigations and prosecutions, carry risk of significant civil and criminal penalties including, but not limited to, debarment from participation in government healthcare programs. Any such debarment could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations. The most significant current investigations and litigation brought by government agencies are described in Note 21, “Legal Proceedings-Government Proceedings” under Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. The Company faces a variety of risks associated with conducting business internationally. The Company’s extensive operations and business activity outside the U.S. are accompanied by certain financial, economic and political risks, including those listed below. Foreign Currency Exchange : In fiscal 2019, approximately 49% of the Company’s sales occurred outside of the U.S., with approximately 23% in Europe, 7% in the Western Hemisphere, excluding the U.S., and 19% in the Asia-Pacific and Africa region. Changes in non-U.S. currencies relative to the U.S. dollar impact the Company’s revenues and expenses. While the Company uses financial instruments to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on its cash flows, 8 unhedged exposures continue to be subject to currency fluctuations. In addition, the weakening or strengthening of the U.S. dollar may result in significant favorable or unfavorable translation effects when the operating results of the Company’s non-U.S. business activity are translated into U.S. dollars. Inflation and Currency Devaluation Risks : The Company faces challenges in maintaining profitability of operations in economies experiencing high inflation rates. The Company has accounted for operations in Argentina (beginning in the fiscal third quarter of 2018) and Venezuela as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. While the Company strives to maintain profit margins in these areas through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price increases, it might experience operating losses as a result of continued inflation. In addition, the impact of currency devaluations in countries experiencing high inflation rates or significant currency exchange fluctuations could negatively impact the Company’s operating results. Illegal Importation of Pharmaceutical Products : The illegal importation of pharmaceutical products from countries where government price controls or other market dynamics result in lower prices may adversely affect the Company’s sales and profitability in the U.S. and other countries in which the Company operates. With the exception of limited quantities of prescription drugs for personal use, foreign imports of pharmaceutical products are illegal under current U.S. law. However, the volume of illegal imports continues to rise as the ability of patients and other customers to obtain the lower-priced imports has grown significantly. Anti-Bribery and Other Regulations: The Company is subject to various federal and foreign laws that govern its international business practices with respect to payments to government officials. Those laws include the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which prohibits U.S. publicly traded companies from promising, offering, or giving anything of value to foreign officials with the corrupt intent of influencing the foreign official for the purpose of helping the Company obtain or retain business or gain any improper advantage. The Company’s business is heavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with foreign officials. Also, in many countries outside the U.S., the health care providers who prescribe human pharmaceuticals are employed by the government and the purchasers of human pharmaceuticals are government entities; therefore, the Company’s interactions with these prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the FCPA. In addition to the U.S. application and enforcement of the FCPA, various jurisdictions in which the Company operates have laws and regulations, including the U.K Bribery Act 2010, aimed at preventing and penalizing corrupt and anticompetitive behavior. Enforcement activities under these laws could subject the Company to additional administrative and legal proceedings and actions, which could include claims for civil penalties, criminal sanctions, and administrative remedies, including exclusion from health care programs. Other Legal, Social and Political Risks . Other risks inherent in conducting business globally include: • protective economic policies taken by governments such as trade protection measures and import/export licensing requirements; • compliance with local regulations and laws including, in some countries, regulatory requirements restricting the Company’s ability to manufacture or sell its products in the relevant market; • diminished protection of intellectual property and contractual rights in certain jurisdictions; • potential nationalization or expropriation of the Company’s foreign assets; and • disruptions to markets due to war, armed conflict, terrorism, social upheavals or pandemics. Interruptions and delays in manufacturing operations could adversely affect the Company’s business, sales and reputation. The Company’s manufacture of products requires the timely delivery of sufficient amounts of complex, high-quality components and materials. The Company's subsidiaries operate 97 manufacturing facilities as well as sourcing from hundreds of suppliers around the world. The Company has in the past, and may in the future, face unanticipated interruptions and delays in manufacturing through its internal or external supply chain. Manufacturing disruptions can occur for many reasons including regulatory action, production quality deviations or safety issues, labor disputes, site-specific incidents (such as fires), natural disasters such as hurricanes and other severe weather events, raw material shortages, political unrest and terrorist attacks. Such delays and difficulties in manufacturing can result in product shortages, declines in sales and reputational impact as well as significant remediation and related costs associated with addressing the shortage. The Company relies on third parties to manufacture certain of our products. Any failure by or loss of a third party manufacturer could result in delays and increased costs, which may adversely affect our business. The Company relies on third parties to manufacture certain of our products. We depend on these third party manufacturers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality 9 and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis and at acceptable prices. However, we cannot guarantee that these third party manufacturers will be able to meet our near-term or long-term manufacturing requirements, which could result in lost sales and have an adverse effect on our business. Other risks associated with our reliance on third parties to manufacture these products include, reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance, misappropriation of the Company’s intellectual property, limited ability to manage our inventory, possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party and the possible termination or nonrenewal of the manufacturing agreement by the third party at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us. Moreover, if any of our third party manufacturers suffer any damage to facilities, lose benefits under material agreements, experience power outages, encounter financial difficulties, are unable to secure necessary raw materials from their suppliers or suffer any other reduction in efficiency, the Company may experience significant business disruption. In the event of any such disruption, the Company would need to seek and source other qualified third party manufacturers, likely resulting in further delays and increased costs which could affect our business adversely. Counterfeit versions of our products could harm our patients and have a negative impact on our revenues, earnings, reputation and business. Our industry continues to be challenged by the vulnerability of distribution channels to illegal counterfeiting and the presence of counterfeit products in a growing number of markets and over the Internet. Third parties may illegally distribute and sell counterfeit versions of our products, which do not meet our rigorous manufacturing and testing standards. To distributors and patients, counterfeit products may be visually indistinguishable from the authentic version. Counterfeit medicines pose a risk to patient health and safety because of the conditions under which they are manufactured-often in unregulated, unlicensed, uninspected and unsanitary sites-as well as the lack of regulation of their contents. The industry's failure to mitigate the threat of counterfeit medicines could adversely impact our business and reputation by impacting patient confidence in our authentic products, potentially resulting in lost sales, product recalls, and an increased threat of litigation. In addition, diversion of our products from their authorized market into other channels may result in reduced revenues and negatively affect our profitability. An information security incident, including a cybersecurity breach, could have a negative impact to the Company’s business or reputation To meet business objectives, the Company relies on both internal information technology (IT) systems and networks, and those of third parties and their vendors, to process and store sensitive data, including confidential research, business plans, financial information, intellectual property, and personal data that may be subject to legal protection. The extensive information security and cybersecurity threats, which affect companies globally, pose a risk to the security and availability of these IT systems and networks, and the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the Company’s sensitive data. The Company continually assesses these threats and makes investments to increase internal protection, detection, and response capabilities, as well as ensure the Company’s third party providers have required capabilities and controls, to address this risk . To date, the Company has not experienced any material impact to the business or operations resulting from information or cybersecurity attacks; however, because of the frequently changing attack techniques, along with the increased volume and sophistication of the attacks, there is the potential for the Company to be adversely impacted. This impact could result in reputational, competitive, operational or other business harm as well as financial costs and regulatory action. The Company maintains cybersecurity insurance in the event of an information security or cyber incident, however, the coverage may not be sufficient to cover all financial losses. 10 Item 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS Not applicable. Item 2. PROPERTIES The Company's subsidiaries operate 97 manufacturing facilities occupying approximately 15.2 million square feet of floor space. The manufacturing facilities are used by the industry segments of the Company’s business approximately as follows: Segment Square Feet (in thousands) Consumer 4,832 Pharmaceutical 5,496 Medical Devices 4,825 Worldwide Total 15,153 Within the U.S., five facilities are used by the Consumer segment, five by the Pharmaceutical segment and 22 by the Medical Devices segment. Outside of the U.S., 25 facilities are used by the Consumer segment, 14 by the Pharmaceutical segment and 26 by the Medical Devices segment. The locations of the manufacturing facilities by major geographic areas of the world are as follows: Geographic Area Number of Facilities Square Feet (in thousands) United States 32 4,480 Europe 27 5,939 Western Hemisphere, excluding U.S. 11 1,833 Africa, Asia and Pacific 27 2,901 Worldwide Total 97 15,153 In addition to the manufacturing facilities discussed above, the Company maintains numerous office and warehouse facilities throughout the world. Research facilities are also discussed in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition of this Report. The Company's subsidiaries generally seek to own, rather than lease, their manufacturing facilities, although some, principally in non-U.S. locations, are leased. Office and warehouse facilities are often leased. The Company also engages contract manufacturers. The Company is committed to maintaining all of its properties in good operating condition. McNEIL-PPC, Inc. (now Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc.) (McNEIL-PPC) continues to operate under a consent decree, signed in 2011 with the FDA, which governs certain McNeil Consumer Healthcare manufacturing operations, and requires McNEIL-PPC to remediate the facilities it operates in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, Fort Washington, Pennsylvania, and Las Piedras, Puerto Rico (the ""Consent Decree""). Following FDA inspections McNEIL-PPC received notifications from the FDA that all three manufacturing facilities are in conformity with applicable laws and regulations, and commercial production has restarted in 2015. Under the Consent Decree, after receiving notice from the FDA of being in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, each of the three facilities is subject to a five-year audit period by a third-party cGMP expert. Thus, a third-party expert will continue to reassess the sites at various times until at least 2020. For information regarding lease obligations, see Note 16 “Lease Commitments” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Segment information on additions to property, plant and equipment is contained in Note 18 “Segments of Business and Geographic Areas” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. 11 Item 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS The information called for by this item is incorporated herein by reference to the information set forth in Note 21 “Legal Proceedings” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. In addition, Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries are also parties to a number of proceedings brought under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund, and comparable state, local or foreign laws in which the primary relief sought is the cost of past and/or future remediation.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION Organization and Business Segments Description of the Company and Business Segments Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 132,200 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the health care field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world with the primary focus on products related to human health and well-being. The Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. The Consumer segment includes a broad range of products used in the baby care, oral care, beauty, over-the-counter pharmaceutical, women’s health and wound care markets. These products are marketed to the general public and sold both to retail outlets and distributors throughout the world. The Pharmaceutical segment is focused on six therapeutic areas, including immunology, infectious diseases, neuroscience, oncology, pulmonary hypertension, and cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Products in this segment are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers, hospitals and health care professionals for prescription use. The Medical Devices segment includes a broad range of products used in the orthopaedic, surgery, interventional solutions (cardiovascular and neurovascular) and eye health fields. These products are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics. The Executive Committee of Johnson & Johnson is the principal management group responsible for the strategic operations and allocation of the resources of the Company. This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities of the Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices business segments. In all of its product lines, the Company competes with other companies both locally and globally, throughout the world. Competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved. Competition in research, involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. The development of new and innovative products, as well as protecting the underlying intellectual property of the Company's product portfolio, is important to the Company’s success in all areas of its business. The competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research. In addition, the development and maintenance of customer demand for the Company’s consumer products involves significant expenditures for advertising and promotion. Management’s Objectives With “Our Credo” as the foundation, the Company’s purpose is to blend heart, science and ingenuity to profoundly change the trajectory of health for humanity. The Company is committed to bringing its full breadth and depth to ensure health for people today and for future generations. United around this common ambition, the Company is poised to fulfill its purpose and successfully meet the demands of the rapidly evolving markets in which it competes. The Company is broadly based in human healthcare, and is committed to creating value by developing accessible, high quality, innovative products and services. New products introduced within the past five years accounted for approximately 25% of 2019 sales. In 2019, $11.4 billion was invested in research and development and $5.8 billion spent on acquisitions, reflecting management’s commitment to create life-enhancing innovations and to create value through partnerships that will profoundly change the trajectory of health for humanity. A critical driver of the Company’s success is the 132,200 diverse employees worldwide. Employees are empowered and inspired to lead with the Company’s Our Credo and purpose as guides. This allows every employee to use the Company’s reach and size to advance the Company's purpose, and to also lead with agility and urgency. Leveraging the extensive resources across the enterprise, enables the Company to innovate and execute with excellence. This ensures the Company can remain focused on addressing the unmet needs of society every day and invest for an enduring impact, ultimately delivering value to its patients, consumers and healthcare professionals, employees, communities and shareholders. 17 Results of Operations Analysis of Consolidated Sales For discussion on results of operations and financial condition pertaining to the fiscal years 2018 and 2017 see the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2018, Item 7.

Major Consumer Franchise Sales: % Change (Dollars in Millions) 2019 2018 ’19 vs. ’18 Beauty $ 4,593 4,382 4.8 % OTC 4,444 4,334 2.5 Baby Care 1,675 1,858 (9.9 ) Oral Care 1,528 1,555 (1.7 ) Women’s Health 986 1,049 (6.0 ) Wound Care/Other 671 675 (0.6 ) Total Consumer Sales $ 13,898 13,853 0.3 % The Beauty franchise sales of $4.6 billion increased 4.8% as compared to the prior year. Growth was primarily driven by incremental sales from the acquisition of Ci:z Holdings Co., Ltd., (DR.CI:LABO) in Japan as well as market growth and share gains of NEUTROGENA ® and AVEENO ® products. Growth was partially offset by the divestitures of RoC ® and NIZORAL ® in the fiscal year 2018. The Over-the-Counter (OTC) franchise sales of $4.4 billion increased 2.5% as compared to the prior year. Growth was primarily driven by incremental sales from the acquisition of ZARBEES ® . Additional contributors to the growth were TYLENOL ® , Children's MOTRIN ® , digestive health products and anti-smoking aids. The Baby Care franchise sales were $1.7 billion in 2019, a decrease of 9.9% compared to the prior year, primarily due to JOHNSON’s ® competitive pressures coupled with comparisons to prior year relaunch activities and the Baby Center divestiture. The Oral Care franchise sales of $1.5 billion decreased 1.7% as compared to the prior year. Growth in LISTERINE ® Mouthwash and Ready Tabs outside the U.S. was offset by share declines and retailer destocking in the U.S. and the negative impact of currency. The Women’s Health franchise sales were $1.0 billion in 2019, a decrease of 6.0% as compared to the prior year. The decline was primarily driven by the negative impact of currency and weakness in liners partially offset by strength in napkins in Asia Pacific and Latin America. The Wound Care/Other franchise sales were $0.7 billion in 2019, a decrease of 0.6% as compared to the prior year. The decline was primarily driven by the divestiture of COMPEED ® outside the U.S. and the negative impact of currency. 19 Pharmaceutical Segment Pharmaceutical segment sales in 2019 were $42.2 billion , an increase of 3.6% from 2018, which included operational growth of 5.8% and a negative currency impact of 2.2%.

Growth was driven by strong uptake of STELARA ® (ustekinumab) in Crohn's disease, and TREMFYA ® (guselkumab) in Psoriasis, expanded indications of SIMPONI ® /SIMPONI ARIA ® (golimumab), and the U.S. immunology market growth. Immunology was negatively impacted by lower sales of REMICADE ® (infliximab) due to increased discounts/rebates and biosimilar competition. The patents for REMICADE ® (infliximab) in certain countries in Europe expired in February 2015. Biosimilar versions of REMICADE ® have been introduced in certain markets outside the U.S., resulting in a reduction in sales of REMICADE ® in those markets. Additional biosimilar competition will likely result in a further reduction in REMICADE ® sales in markets outside the United States. In the U.S., a biosimilar version of REMICADE ® was introduced in 2016, and additional competitors continue to enter the market. Continued infliximab biosimilar competition in the U.S. market will result in a further reduction in U.S. sales of REMICADE ® . See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of legal matters regarding the REMICADE ® patents. Infectious disease products sales were $3.4 billion in 2019, representing an increase of 3.3% as compared to the prior year. Strong sales of SYMTUZA ® and the launch of JULUCA ® (dolutegravir/rilpivirine) were partially offset by lower sales of PREZISTA ® and PREZCOBIX ® /REZOLSTA ® (darunavir/cobicistat) due to increased competition and loss of exclusivity of PREZISTA ® in certain countries outside the U.S. Neuroscience products sales were $6.3 billion , representing an increase of 4.1% as compared to the prior year. Strong sales of long-acting injectables INVEGA TRINZA ® /TREVICTA ® (paliperidone palmitate) and INVEGA SUSTENNA ® /XEPLION ® were partially offset by cannibalization of RISPERDAL CONSTA ® (risperidone). Oncology products achieved sales of $10.7 billion in 2019, representing an increase of 8.6% as compared to the prior year. Contributors to the growth were strong sales of DARZALEX ® (daratumumab) with continued market growth and share gain, IMBRUVICA ® (ibrutinib) due to increased patient uptake globally. Additionally, sales from the launch of ERLEADA™ (apalutamide) contributed to the growth. Growth was negatively impacted from a decline in U.S. sales of ZYTIGA ® (abiraterone acetate) driven by generic competition partially offset by increased sales outside the U.S. Lower sales of VELCADE ® (bortezomib) were also due to generic competition. Pulmonary Hypertension products achieved sales of $2.6 billion , representing an increase of 1.9% as compared to the prior year. Sales of OPSUMIT ® (macitentan) and UPTRAVI ® (selexipag) were due to continued market growth and increased share gains while sales of TRACLEER ® (bosentan) were negatively impacted by generics and cannibalization from OPSUMIT ® . Cardiovascular/Metabolism/Other products sales were $5.2 billion , a decline of 10.7% as compared to the prior year. XARELTO ® (rivaroxaban) sales volume growth was offset by higher discounts and rebates. Lower sales of INVOKANA ® /INVOKAMET ® (canagliflozin) were due to share loss from competitive pressure and a safety label update in the U.S. and lower sales of PROCRIT ® / EPREX ® (epoetin alfa) were due to biosimilar competition. 21 During 2019, the Company advanced its pipeline with several regulatory submissions and approvals for new drugs and additional indications for existing drugs as follows: Product Name (Chemical Name) Indication US Approval EU Approval US Filing EU Filing BALVERSA™ (erdafitinib) Treatment of locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer  DARZALEX ® (daratumumab) Combination Regimen for Newly Diagnosed, Transplant-eligible Patients with Multiple Myeloma   Newly diagnosed patients with Multiple Myeloma in combination with Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone  Split-dosing regimen  Combination therapy for transplant ineligible Multiple Myeloma patients   Subcutaneous Formulation in Multiple Myeloma   ERLEADA™ (apalutamide) Treatment of Metastatic Castration-Sensitive Prostate Cancer  Treatment of Metastatic Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer  IMBRUVICA ® (ibrutinib) Expanded Use in Combination with Obinutuzumab in Adult Patients with Previously Untreated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia and in Combination with Rituximab in Waldenström's Macroglobulinemia  Treatment for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia in combination with obinutuzumab  INVOKANA ® (canagliflozin) Treatment of Diabetic Kidney Disease  rilpivirine and cabotegravir For Monthly, Injectable, Two Drug Regimen for Treatment of HIV   SPRAVATO ® (esketamine) Treatment-resistant depression   Rapid Reduction of Depressive Symptoms in Adults with Major Depressive Disorder who have Active Suicidal Ideation with Intent  STELARA ® (ustekinumab) Extended Use for the Treatment of Moderately to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis   Treatment of Pediatric Patients with Moderate to Severe Plaque Psoriasis  TREMFYA ® (guselkumab) One-press patient-controlled injector  Treatment of Adults with Active Psoriatic Arthritis   XARELTO ® (rivaroxaban) For the prevention of Blood Clots in Acutely Ill Medical Patients  22 Medical Devices Segment The Medical Devices segment sales in 2019 were $26.0 billion , a decrease of 3.8% from 2018, which included an operational decrease of 1.7% and a negative currency impact of 2.1%. U.S. sales were $12.4 billion , a decrease of 3.5% as compared to the prior year. International sales were $13.6 billion , a decrease of 4.1% as compared to the prior year, with an operational decrease of 0.1% and a negative currency impact of 4.0%. In 2019, the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures on the Medical Devices segment worldwide operational sales growth was a negative 5.6% of which, the divestitures of LifeScan and Advanced Sterilization Products (ASP) had an impact of approximately 3.8% and 1.6%, respectively.

Growth in Advanced Surgery was primarily driven by endocutter, biosurgery and energy products. The decline in General Surgery was primarily driven by the negative impact of currency partially offset by growth of wound closure products. The decline in Specialty Surgery was primarily driven by the divestiture of the sterilization business (ASP) partially offset by growth of aesthetic products. The Orthopaedics franchise sales were $8.8 billion in 2019, a decrease of 0.5% , including operational growth of 1.2% offset by a negative currency impact of 1.7% as compared to the prior year. The growth in hips was driven by leadership position in the anterior approach, strong market demand for the ACTIS ® stem and the KINCISE™ surgical automated system. Knees grew outside the U.S. from new products coupled with continued global uptake of ATTUNE ® Revision, offset by a negative currency impact. Growth in trauma was due to strong market growth coupled with continued uptake of new products. The decline in Spine & Other was primarily driven by base business declines in Spine partially offset by growth in Sports which was led by new products, MONOVISC ® in the U.S. and growth in Asia Pacific. The Vision franchise achieved sales of $4.6 billion in 2019, an increase of 1.6% from 2018. Growth was primarily driven by the strength of daily disposable lenses in the ACUVUE ® OASYS contact lenses category. The Surgical operational growth was primarily driven by the strength of cataracts outside the U.S. partially offset by competitive pressures in the U.S. The Interventional Solutions franchise achieved sales of $3.0 billion in 2019, an increase of 13.3% from 2018. Strong growth in the electrophysiology business was driven by Atrial Fibrillation procedure growth and with strong THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH ® SF Contact Force Sensing Catheter and diagnostic catheter sales. 23 Analysis of Consolidated Earnings Before Provision for Taxes on Income Consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income was $17.3 billion and $18.0 billion for the fiscal years ended 2019 and 2018, respectively. As a percent to sales, consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income was 21.1% and 22.1%, in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Cost of Products Sold and Selling, Marketing and Administrative Expenses: Cost of products sold and selling, marketing and administrative expenses as a percent to sales were as follows: % of Sales 2019 2018 Cost of products sold 33.6 % 33.2 Percent point increase/(decrease) over the prior year 0.4 (0.1 ) Selling, marketing and administrative expenses 27.0 % 27.6 Percent point increase/(decrease) over the prior year (0.6 ) (0.5 ) In 2019, cost of products sold as a percent to sales increased to 33.6% from 33.2% as compared to the same period a year ago primarily driven by the negative impact of currency in the Pharmaceutical business as well as increased intangible asset amortization expense. Intangible asset amortization expense of $4.5 billion was included in cost of products sold for 2019 as compared to $4.4 billion in 2018. There was a decrease in the percent to sales of selling, marketing and administrative expenses in 2019 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to favorable segment mix with a higher percentage of sales coming from the Pharmaceutical business, planned prioritization and reduced brand marketing expense in the Consumer business partially offset by increased selling and marketing investments in the Medical Devices business. Research and Development Expense: Research and development expense by segment of business was as follows: 2019 2018 (Dollars in Millions) Amount % of Sales* Amount % of Sales* Consumer $ 493 3.5 % 565 4.1 Pharmaceutical 8,834 20.9 8,446 20.7 Medical Devices 2,028 7.8 1,764 6.5 Total research and development expense $ 11,355 13.8 % 10,775 13.2 Percent increase/(decrease) over the prior year 5.4 % 1.7 *As a percent to segment sales 24 Research and development activities represent a significant part of the Company's business. These expenditures relate to the processes of discovering, testing and developing new products, upfront payments and developmental milestones, improving existing products, as well as ensuring product efficacy and regulatory compliance prior to launch. The Company remains committed to investing in research and development with the aim of delivering high quality and innovative products. In 2019, worldwide costs of research and development activities increased by 5.4% compared to 2018 primarily driven by increased investment in the Medical Devices business related to robotics and digital surgery platforms along with higher upfront and developmental milestone payments, primarily from the argenx collaboration in the Pharmaceutical business. Research facilities are located in the U.S., Belgium, Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Israel, the Netherlands, Poland, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom with additional R&D support in over 30 other countries. In-Process Research and Development (IPR&D): In the fiscal first quarter of 2019, the Company recorded an IPR&D charge of $0.9 billion for the remaining intangible asset value related to the development program of AL-8176, an investigational drug for the treatment of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) acquired with the 2014 acquisition of Alios Biopharma Inc. The impairment charge was based on additional information, including clinical data, which became available and led to the Company's decision to abandon the development of AL-8176. In the fiscal third quarter of 2018, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $1.1 billion which included a partial impairment charge of $0.8 billion related to the development program of AL-8176 and an impairment charge of $0.3 billion for the discontinuation of the development project for an anti-thrombin antibody associated with the 2015 acquisition of XO1 Limited. Other (Income) Expense, Net: Other (income) expense, net is the account where the Company records gains and losses related to the sale and write-down of certain investments in equity securities held by Johnson & Johnson Innovation - JJDC, Inc. (JJDC), unrealized gains and losses on investments, gains and losses on divestitures, certain transactional currency gains and losses, acquisition-related costs, litigation accruals and settlements, as well as royalty income. The change in other (income) expense, net for the fiscal year 2019 was additional net expense of $1.1 billion primarily attributable to litigation expense of $5.1 billion in 2019, primarily related to the agreement in principle to settle opioid litigation of $4.0 billion, as compared to litigation expense of $2.0 billion in 2018. This was partially offset by divestiture gains in 2019 of $2.2 billion of which $2.0 billion related to the divestiture of the ASP business. In addition, the fiscal year 2019 included higher unrealized gains on securities of $0.7 billion, an equity step-up gain of $0.3 billion related to the Company's previously held equity investment in DR. CI:LABO, and lower restructuring related expense of $0.2 billion as compared to the same period a year ago. Divestiture gains were approximately $1.2 billion in 2018 and included the LifeScan business, NIZORAL ® , RoC ® and certain non-strategic Pharmaceutical products. Additionally, 2018 included a reversal of a contingent liability of $0.2 billion. Interest (Income) Expense: The fiscal year 2019 included net interest income as compared to an expense in the fiscal year 2018. This was primarily due to the positive effect of net investment hedging arrangements and certain cross currency swaps, and a lower average debt balance. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $19.3 billion at the end of 2019, and averaged $19.5 billion as compared to the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities total of $19.7 billion and $19.0 billion average cash balance in 2018. The total debt balance at the end of 2019 was $27.7 billion with an average debt balance of $29.1 billion as compared to $30.5 billion at the end of 2018 and an average debt balance of $32.5 billion. The decrease in debt was due to the retirement of long-term debt. Income Before Tax by Segment Income before tax by segment of business were as follows: Income Before Tax Segment Sales Percent of Segment Sales (Dollars in Millions) 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018 Consumer $ 2,061 2,320 13,898 13,853 14.8 % 16.7 Pharmaceutical 8,816 12,568 42,198 40,734 20.9 30.9 Medical Devices 7,286 4,397 25,963 26,994 28.1 16.3 Total (1) 18,163 19,285 82,059 81,581 22.1 23.6 Less: Net expense not allocated to segments (2) 835 1,286 Earnings before provision for taxes on income $ 17,328 17,999 82,059 81,581 21.1 % 22.1 (1) See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details. (2) Amounts not allocated to segments include interest (income) expense and general corporate (income) expense. 25 Consumer Segment: In 2019, the Consumer segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 14.8% , versus 16.7% in 2018. The decrease in the income before tax as a percent of sales in 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily attributable to higher expenses for litigation of $0.1 billion, intangible asset amortization of $0.1 billion and restructuring of $0.1 billion in the fiscal year 2019 as compared to the fiscal year 2018. This was partially offset by planned prioritization and brand marketing expense reductions. The fiscal year 2019 included a gain of $0.3 billion related to the Company's previously held equity investment in DR. CI:LABO. Divestiture gains for the fiscal year of 2018 included a gain of $0.3 billion from the divestiture of NIZORAL ® . Pharmaceutical Segment: In 2019, the Pharmaceutical segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 20.9% versus 30.9% in 2018. The decrease in the income before tax as a percent of sales was primarily due to higher litigation expense of $4.3 billion, primarily due to the agreement in principle to settle opioid litigation of $4.0 billion, increased spending in research and development, including a $0.3 billion upfront payment to argenx. This was partially offset by $0.8 billion of higher unrealized gains on securities, a lower in-process research and development charge of $0.2 billion, and lower Actelion acquisition and integration related costs as compared to the fiscal year 2018. In addition, the fiscal year 2018 included a contingent liability reversal of $0.2 billion and higher divestiture gains of $0.2 billion. Medical Devices Segment: In 2019, the Medical Devices segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 28.1% versus 16.3% in 2018. The increase in the income before tax as a percent to sales was primarily attributable to higher divestiture gains in 2019. Divestiture gains in the fiscal 2019 included a gain of $2.0 billion related to the ASP business. Divestiture gains for the fiscal year of 2018 included a gain of $0.5 billion related to LifeScan. Additionally, the fiscal year 2019 included lower litigation expense of $1.3 billion, lower restructuring charges of $0.2 billion and lower intangible asset amortization expense of $0.1 billion as compared to the fiscal year 2018. This was partially offset by increased investment in robotics and digital solutions. Restructuring: In the fiscal second quarter of 2018, the Company announced plans to implement actions across its global supply chain that are intended to enable the Company to focus resources and increase investments in critical capabilities, technologies and solutions necessary to manufacture and supply its product portfolio of the future, enhance agility and drive growth. The Company expects these supply chain actions will include expanding its use of strategic collaborations, and bolstering its initiatives to reduce complexity, improving cost-competitiveness, enhancing capabilities and optimizing its network. Discussions regarding specific future actions are ongoing and are subject to all relevant consultation requirements before they are finalized. In total, the Company expects these actions to generate approximately $0.6 to $0.8 billion in annual pre-tax cost savings that will be substantially delivered by 2022. The Company expects to record pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $1.9 to $2.3 billion. The Company estimates that approximately 70% of the cumulative pre-tax costs will result in cash outlays. In 2019, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $0.6 billion, which is included on the following lines of the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, $0.3 billion in restructuring, $0.2 billion in other (income) expense and $0.1 billion in cost of products sold. Total project costs of approximately $0.8 billion have been recorded since the restructuring was announced. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the restructuring programs. Provision for Taxes on Income: The worldwide effective income tax rate was 12.7% in 2019 and 15.0% in 2018 . For discussion related to the fiscal 2019 provision for taxes refer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. On September 28, 2018 the Swiss Parliament approved the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (TRAF). On May 19, 2019 a public referendum was held in Switzerland that approved the federal reform proposals. In the fiscal third quarter of 2019, the Swiss Federal Council enacted TRAF which became effective on January 1, 2020. On February 9, 2020 a public referendum on the legislative change was held in the last remaining canton where the Company has significant operations. The legislation was approved by the voters and formal enactment is expected in the fiscal first half of 2020. The Company has not yet elected the transitional provision in this canton. However, the net financial benefit is estimated to be between $0.2 billion and $0.5 billion in the fiscal first half of 2020. The Company does not believe that TRAF will have a material impact to the Company’s ongoing consolidated effective tax rate beginning in fiscal year 2020. 26 Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity & Cash Flows Cash and cash equivalents were $17.3 billion at the end of 2019 as compared to $18.1 billion at the end of 2018. The primary sources and uses of cash that contributed to the $0.8 billion decrease were approximately $23.4 billion of cash generated from operating activities. This was offset by $6.2 billion net cash used by investing activities and $18.0 billion net cash used by financing activities. In addition, the Company had $2.0 billion in marketable securities at the end of 2019 and $1.6 billion at the end of 2018. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Cash flow from operations of $23.4 billion was the result of $15.1 billion of net earnings and $9.1 billion of non-cash expenses and other adjustments for depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, assets write-downs (primarily related to the Alios IPR&D asset), and favorable increases in accounts payable, accrued liabilities and other liabilities of $5.5 billion. This was reduced by $1.6 billion related to an increase in accounts receivable, inventories, other current and non-current assets. as well as non-cash expenses and other adjustments of $2.5 billion for the increase in the deferred tax provision and a net gain on sale of assets/businesses of $2.2 billion (primarily related to the ASP divestiture). Investing activities use of $6.2 billion of cash was primarily used for acquisitions of $5.8 billion primarily related to the acquisitions of Auris Health, Inc. and DR. CI:LABO, additions to property, plant and equipment of $3.5 billion and $0.5 billion from the net purchases of investments. Investing activities also included a source of $3.3 billion of proceeds from the disposal of assets/businesses, primarily the ASP divestiture, and proceeds from credit support agreements of $0.3 billion. Financing activities use of $18.0 billion of cash was primarily used for dividends to shareholders of $9.9 billion, the repurchase of common stock of $6.7 billion and the net retirement of short and long term debt of $2.9 billion. Financing activities also included sources of $1.5 billion from proceeds of stock options exercised/employee withholding tax on stock awards, and other financing activities. On December 17, 2018, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program, authorizing the Company to purchase up to $5.0 billion of the Company's shares of common stock. Shares acquired are available for general corporate purposes. The Company financed the share repurchase program through available cash. As of September 29, 2019, $5.0 billion was repurchased under the program and the program was completed. As of December 29, 2019, the Company's notes payable and long-term debt was in excess of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. As of December 29, 2019, the net debt position was $8.4 billion as compared to the prior year of $10.8 billion. There was a decrease in the net debt position due to retirement of debt. The debt balance at the end of 2019 was $27.7 billion as compared to $30.5 billion in 2018. In 2019, the Company continued to have access to liquidity through the commercial paper market. Additionally, as a result of the TCJA, the Company has access to its cash outside the U.S. at a significantly reduced cost. The Company anticipates that operating cash flows, the ability to raise funds from external sources, borrowing capacity from existing committed credit facilities and access to the commercial paper markets will continue to provide sufficient resources to fund operating needs, including the agreement in principle to settle opioid litigation to be potentially paid over the next two to three years. As discussed in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has completed its audit for the tax years through 2009 and is currently auditing the tax years 2010-2012. The Company currently expects completion of this audit and settlement of the related tax liabilities in the fiscal year 2020. As of December 29, 2019, the Company has classified unrecognized tax benefits and related interest of approximately $0.9 billion as a current liability in the “Accrued taxes on Income” line in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. This is the amount expected to be paid over the next 12 months with respect to the IRS audit. Subsequent to December 29, 2019, the Company made a payment for approximately $0.6 billion to the U.S. Treasury related to the estimated 2010-2012 tax audit liability in anticipation of the final settlement later in fiscal 2020. The completion of this tax audit may result in additional adjustments to the Company’s unrecognized tax benefit liability that may have a material impact on the Company’s future operating results or cash flows in the period that the audit is substantially completed. The Company monitors the global capital markets on an ongoing basis and from time to time may raise capital when market conditions are favorable. The Company filed a shelf registration on February 27, 2017, which will enable it to issue debt securities on a timely basis and will be updated as required. For additional details on borrowings, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Financing and Market Risk The Company uses financial instruments to manage the impact of foreign exchange rate changes on cash flows. Accordingly, the Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to protect the value of certain foreign currency assets and liabilities and to hedge future foreign currency transactions primarily related to product costs. Gains or losses on these contracts are offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions. A 10% appreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the December 29, 2019 market rates would increase the unrealized value of the Company’s forward contracts by $271 million. Conversely, a 27 10% depreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the December 29, 2019 market rates would decrease the unrealized value of the Company’s forward contracts by $331 million. In either scenario, the gain or loss on the forward contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated earnings and cash flows. The Company hedges the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and the effect on certain assets and liabilities in foreign currency, by entering into currency swap contracts. A 1% change in the spread between U.S. and foreign interest rates on the Company’s interest rate sensitive financial instruments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of the Company’s swap contracts by approximately $1,043 million. In either scenario, at maturity, the gain or loss on the swap contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated cash flows. The Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Further, the Company has a policy of only entering into contracts with parties that have at least an investment grade credit rating. The counter-parties to these contracts are major financial institutions and there is no significant concentration of exposure with any one counter-party. Management believes the risk of loss is remote. During the fiscal second quarter of 2017, the Company entered into credit support agreements (CSA) with certain derivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on respective credit ratings and netting agreements. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on credit support agreements. The Company invests in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities which carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. A 1% (100 basis points) change in spread on the Company’s interest rate sensitive investments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of cash equivalents and current marketable securities by approximately $7 million. The Company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous banks worldwide. In September 2019, the Company secured a new 364-day Credit Facility. Total credit available to the Company approximates $10 billion, which expires on September 10, 2020. Interest charged on borrowings under the credit line agreement is based on either bids provided by banks, the prime rate, London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR), or other applicable market rate as allowed under the terms of the agreement, plus applicable margins. Commitment fees under the agreement are not material. Total borrowings at the end of 2019 and 2018 were $27.7 billion and $30.5 billion, respectively. The decrease in borrowings was due to the retirement of debt in 2019. In 2019, net debt (cash and current marketable securities, net of debt) was $8.4 billion compared to net debt of $10.8 billion in 2018. Total debt represented 31.8% of total capital (shareholders’ equity and total debt) in 2019 and 33.8% of total capital in 2018. Shareholders’ equity per share at the end of 2019 was $22.59 compared to $22.44 at year-end 2018 . A summary of borrowings can be found in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Contractual Obligations and Commitments The Company’s contractual obligations are primarily for the recently enacted tax legislation, leases, debt and unfunded retirement plans. There are no other significant obligations. To satisfy these obligations, the Company will use cash from operations. The following table summarizes the Company’s contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as of December 29, 2019 (see Notes 7, 8, 10 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details): (Dollars in Millions) Tax Legislation (TCJA) Debt Obligations Interest on Debt Obligations Unfunded Retirement Plans Leases Total 2020 $ 528 1,100 886 103 215 2,832 2021 812 1,797 841 107 254 3,811 2022 812 2,106 796 113 197 4,024 2023 1,522 1,552 764 118 141 4,097 2024 2,029 1,474 729 127 86 4,445 After 2024 2,536 19,565 8,121 749 201 31,172 Total $ 8,239 27,594 12,137 1,317 1,094 50,381 For tax matters, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The table does not include activity related to business combinations. 28 Dividends The Company increased its dividend in 2019 for the 57th consecutive year. Cash dividends paid were $3.75 per share in 2019 and $3.54 per share in 2018 . Other Information Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are based on the Company’s consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and other related disclosures. Actual results may or may not differ from these estimates. The Company believes that the understanding of certain key accounting policies and estimates are essential in achieving more insight into the Company’s operating results and financial condition. These key accounting policies include revenue recognition, income taxes, legal and self-insurance contingencies, valuation of long-lived assets, assumptions used to determine the amounts recorded for pensions and other employee benefit plans and accounting for stock based awards. Revenue Recognition: The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the goods to customers. The Company's global payment terms are typically between 30 to 90 days. Provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns and discounts to customers are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Accounting Standards Update related to revenue which was adopted in 2018. Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants, as well as market conditions, including consideration of competitor pricing. Rebates are estimated based on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served. The Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through the analysis of wholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally generated information. Sales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals. Sales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in the field, or in specific areas, product recall. The sales returns reserve is based on historical return trends by product and by market as a percent to gross sales. In accordance with the Company’s accounting policies, the Company generally issues credit to customers for returned goods. The Company’s sales returns reserves are accounted for in accordance with the U.S. GAAP guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns reserves are recorded at full sales value. Sales returns in the Consumer and Pharmaceutical segments are almost exclusively not resalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the Medical Devices segment are typically resalable but are not material. The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products. The sales returns reserve for the total Company has been approximately 1.0% of annual net trade sales during the fiscal reporting years 2019 and 2018 . Promotional programs, such as product listing allowances and cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in the same period as related sales. Continuing promotional programs include coupons and volume-based sales incentive programs. The redemption cost of consumer coupons is based on historical redemption experience by product and value. Volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales volumes for the incentive period and are recorded as products are sold. These arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred or recorded as a reduction of revenue. The Company also earns profit-share payments through collaborative arrangements of certain products, which are included in sales to customers. For all years presented, profit-share payments were approximately 2.0% of the total revenues and are included in sales to customers. In addition, the Company enters into collaboration arrangements that contain multiple revenue generating activities. Amounts due from collaborative partners for these arrangements are recognized as each activity is performed or delivered, based on the relative selling price. Upfront fees received as part of these arrangements are deferred and recognized over the performance period. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures on collaborations. Reasonably likely changes to assumptions used to calculate the accruals for rebates, returns and promotions are not anticipated to have a material effect on the financial statements. The Company currently discloses the impact of changes to assumptions in the quarterly or annual filing in which there is a material financial statement impact. 29 Below are tables that show the progression of accrued rebates, returns, promotions, reserve for doubtful accounts and reserve for cash discounts by segment of business for the fiscal years ended December 29, 2019 and December 30, 2018 .

(2) Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation. Income Taxes: Income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and include the results of any difference between U.S. GAAP accounting and tax reporting, recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities. The Company estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on enacted tax regulations and rates. Future changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company follows U.S. GAAP, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Management believes that changes in these estimates would not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial position. The Company has recorded deferred tax liabilities on all undistributed earnings prior to December 31, 2017 from its international subsidiaries. The Company has not provided deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings subsequent to January 1, 2018 from certain international subsidiaries where the earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. The Company intends to continue to reinvest these earnings in those international operations. If the Company decides at a later date to repatriate these earnings to the U.S., the Company would be required to provide for the net tax effects on these amounts. The Company estimates that the total tax effect of this repatriation would be approximately $0.8 billion under current enacted tax laws and regulations and at current currency exchange rates. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding income taxes. Legal and Self Insurance Contingencies: The Company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal proceedings and product liability claims as these arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on management’s judgment as to the probability of losses and, where applicable, actuarially determined estimates. The Company has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals in the self insurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated. The Company follows the provisions of U.S. GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies. A liability is recorded when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. The best estimate of a loss within a range is accrued; however, if no estimate in the range is better than any other, the minimum amount is accrued. 31 See Notes 1 and 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding product liability and legal proceedings. Long-Lived and Intangible Assets: The Company assesses changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows in evaluating the value of the Company’s property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets. As these assumptions and estimates may change over time, it may or may not be necessary for the Company to record impairment charges. Employee Benefit Plans: The Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit, defined contribution and termination indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide. These plans are based on assumptions for the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, expected salary increases, health care cost trend rates and attrition rates. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on these rates and the effect a rate change to the health care cost trend would have on the Company’s results of operations. Stock Based Compensation: The Company recognizes compensation expense associated with the issuance of equity instruments to employees for their services. Based on the type of equity instrument, the fair value is estimated on the date of grant using either the Black-Scholes option valuation model or a combination of both the Black-Scholes option valuation model and Monte Carlo valuation model, and is expensed in the financial statements over the service period. The input assumptions used in determining fair value are the expected life, expected volatility, risk-free rate and expected dividend yield. For performance share units the fair market value is calculated for each of the three component goals at the date of grant. The fair values for the sales and earnings per share goals of each performance share unit were estimated on the date of grant using the fair market value of the shares at the time of the award, discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the performance share units during the vesting period. The fair value for the relative total shareholder return goal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo valuation model. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. New Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of December 29, 2019 . Economic and Market Factors The Company is aware that its products are used in an environment where, for more than a decade, policymakers, consumers and businesses have expressed concerns about the rising cost of health care. In response to these concerns, the Company has a long-standing policy of pricing products responsibly. For the period 2009 - 2019, in the U.S., the weighted average compound annual growth rate of the Company’s net price increases for health care products (prescription and over-the-counter drugs, hospital and professional products) was below the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI). The Company operates in certain countries where the economic conditions continue to present significant challenges. The Company continues to monitor these situations and take appropriate actions. Inflation rates continue to have an effect on worldwide economies and, consequently, on the way companies operate. The Company has accounted for operations in Argentina (beginning in the fiscal third quarter of 2018) and Venezuela as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. This did not have a material impact to the Company's results in the period. In the face of increasing costs, the Company strives to maintain its profit margins through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price increases. In June 2016, the United Kingdom (U.K.) held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union (E.U.), commonly referred to as “Brexit” and on January 31, 2020, the U.K. formally exited the E.U. Given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what the ultimate financial, trade, regulatory and legal implications the withdrawal of the U.K. from the E.U. will have. Brexit creates global political and economic uncertainty, which may cause, among other consequences, volatility in exchange rates and interest rates, additional cost containment by third-party payors and changes in regulations. However, the Company currently does not believe that these and other related effects will have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position or operating results. As of December 29, 2019, the business of the Company’s U.K. subsidiaries represented less than 3% of both the Company’s consolidated assets and fiscal twelve months revenues, respectively. The Company is exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. A 1% change in the value of the U.S. Dollar as compared to all foreign currencies in which the Company had sales, income or expense in 2019 would have increased or decreased the translation of foreign sales by approximately $390 million and net income by approximately $120 million. Governments around the world consider various proposals to make changes to tax laws, which may include increasing or decreasing existing statutory tax rates. A change in statutory tax rate in any country would result in the revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the period in which the new tax law is enacted. This change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The Company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the countries where it operates. Changes to the statutory tax rate 32 may occur at any time, and any related expense or benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted. For discussion on Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (Swiss Tax Reform) see Provision for Taxes on Income in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The Company faces various worldwide health care changes that may continue to result in pricing pressures that include health care cost containment and government legislation relating to sales, promotions and reimbursement of health care products. Changes in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of health care products and services, including delaying medical procedures, rationing prescription medications, reducing the frequency of physician visits and foregoing health care insurance coverage, as a result of the current global economic downturn, may continue to impact the Company’s businesses. The Company also operates in an environment increasingly hostile to intellectual property rights. Firms have filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications or Biosimilar Biological Product Applications with the FDA or otherwise challenged the coverage and/or validity of the Company's patents, seeking to market generic or biosimilar forms of many of the Company’s key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. In the event the Company is not successful in defending the patent claims challenged in the resulting lawsuits, generic or biosimilar versions of the products at issue will be introduced to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for those products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. There is also a risk that one or more competitors could launch a generic or biosimilar version of the product at issue following regulatory approval even though one or more valid patents are in place. For further information, see the discussion on “REMICADE ® Related Cases” and “Litigation Against Filers of Abbreviated New Drug Applications” in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Legal Proceedings Johnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial and other matters; governmental investigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. The Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of December 29, 2019 , the Company has determined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal issue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance with ASC 450-20-25. For these and other litigation and regulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts already accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors including, among other things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and unpredictability of the number of potential claims; or there are numerous parties involved. To the extent adverse verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated. In the Company's opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with counsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company's balance sheet, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position. However, the resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and cash flows for that period. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding legal proceedings. Common Stock The Company’s Common Stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol JNJ. As of February 12, 2020, there were 135,953 record holders of Common Stock of the Company.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company). Intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated. Columns and rows within tables may not add due to rounding. Percentages have been calculated using actual, non-rounded figures. Description of the Company and Business Segments The Company has approximately 132,200 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the health care field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world and its primary focus is on products related to human health and well-being. The Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. The Consumer segment includes a broad range of products used in the baby care, oral care, beauty, over-the-counter pharmaceutical, women’s health and wound care markets. These products are marketed to the general public and sold both to retail outlets and distributors throughout the world. The Pharmaceutical segment is focused on six therapeutic areas, including immunology, infectious diseases, neuroscience, oncology, pulmonary hypertension, and cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Products in this segment are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers, hospitals and health care professionals for prescription use. The Medical Devices segment includes a broad range of products used in the orthopaedic, surgery, interventional solutions (cardiovascular and neurovascular) and eye health fields, which are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics. New Accounting Standards Recently Adopted Accounting Standards ASU 2016-02 : Leases The Company adopted this standard as of the beginning of fiscal year 2019, on a prospective basis. This update requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for all lease obligations and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. This update requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for arrangements that are classified as operating leases. The Company’s operating leases resulted in the recognition of additional assets and the corresponding liabilities on its Consolidated Balance Sheet, however it did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. The Company determines whether an arrangement is a lease at contract inception by establishing if the contract conveys the right to control the use of identified property, plant, or equipment for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Right of Use (ROU) Assets and Lease Liabilities for operating leases are included in Other assets, Accrued liabilities, and Other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. The ROU Assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent an obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Commitments under finance leases are not significant, and are included in Property, plant and equipment, Loans and notes payable, and Long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheet. ROU Assets and Lease Liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of all minimum lease payments over the lease term. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments, when the implicit rate is not readily determinable. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease. These options are included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company has elected the following policy elections on adoption: use of portfolio approach on leases of assets under master service agreements, exclusion of short term leases on the balance sheet, and not separating lease and non-lease components. For additional disclosures see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. ASU 2018-02 : Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income This update allows a Company to elect to reclassify stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Job Act enacted in December 2017 from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings. The Company has elected not to reclassify the income tax effects of this standard and therefore this standard will not impact the Company's consolidated financial statements. 41 ASU 2018-16 : Derivatives and Hedging (Topic ASC 815) This update adds the Overnight Index Swap (OIS) rate based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as an eligible benchmark interest rate permitted in the application of hedge accounting. The guidance was effective for the Company as of the fiscal fourth quarter of 2018, due to the previous adoption of ASU 2017-12. The impact of the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. The standard may have an impact in the future as the market for SOFR derivatives develops over time and if SOFR is used to hedge the Company’s financial instruments. Accounting Standards adopted in the fiscal 2018 with a cumulative effect to the 2018 opening balance of Retained Earnings The following table summarizes the cumulative effect adjustments made to the 2018 opening balance of retained earnings upon adoption of the new accounting standards mentioned below: (Dollars in Millions) Cumulative Effect Adjustment Increase (Decrease) to Retained Earnings ASU 2014-09 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers $ ( 47 ) ASU 2016-01 - Financial Instruments 232 ASU 2016-16 - Income Taxes: Intra-Entity Transfers ( 439 ) Total $ ( 254 ) Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Adopted as of December 29, 2019 ASU 2018-18 : Collaborative Arrangements This update clarifies the interaction between ASC 808, Collaborative Arrangements and ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The update clarifies that certain transactions between participants in a collaborative arrangement should be accounted for under ASC 606 when the counterparty is a customer. In addition, the update precludes an entity from presenting consideration from a transaction in a collaborative arrangement as revenue if the counterparty is not a customer for that transaction. This update will be effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years. ASU 2018-18 should be applied retrospectively to the date of initial application of ASC 606 and early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. ASU 2016-13 : Financial Instruments - Credit Losses This update introduces the current expected credit loss (CECL) model, which will require an entity to measure credit losses for certain financial instruments and financial assets, including trade receivables. Under this update, on initial recognition and at each reporting period, an entity will be required to recognize an allowance that reflects the entity’s current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the financial instrument. This update will be effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Cash Equivalents The Company classifies all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of three months or less from date of purchase as cash equivalents and all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of greater than three months from the date of purchase as current marketable securities. The Company has a policy of making investments only with commercial institutions that have at least an investment grade credit rating. The Company invests its cash primarily in government securities and obligations, corporate debt securities, money market funds and reverse repurchase agreements (RRAs). RRAs are collateralized by deposits in the form of Government Securities and Obligations for an amount not less than 102 % of their value. The Company does not record an asset or liability as the Company is not permitted to sell or repledge the associated collateral. The Company has a policy that the collateral has at least an A (or equivalent) credit rating. The Company utilizes a third party custodian to manage the exchange of funds and ensure that collateral received is maintained at 102 % of the value of the RRAs on a daily basis. RRAs with stated maturities of greater than three months from the date of purchase are classified as marketable securities. 42 Investments Investments classified as held to maturity investments are reported at amortized cost and realized gains or losses are reported in earnings. Investments classified as available-for-sale debt securities are carried at estimated fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Available-for-sale securities available for current operations are classified as current assets otherwise, they are classified as long term. Management determines the appropriate classification of its investment in debt and equity securities at the time of purchase and re-evaluates such determination at each balance sheet date. The Company reviews its investments for impairment and adjusts these investments to fair value through earnings, as required. Property, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. The Company utilizes the straight-line method of depreciation over the estimated useful lives of the assets: Building and building equipment 20 - 30 years Land and leasehold improvements 10 - 20 years Machinery and equipment 2 - 13 years The Company capitalizes certain computer software and development costs, included in machinery and equipment, when incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use. Capitalized software costs are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the software, which generally range from 3 to 8 years. The Company reviews long-lived assets to assess recoverability using undiscounted cash flows. When certain events or changes in operating or economic conditions occur, an impairment assessment may be performed on the recoverability of the carrying value of these assets. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset’s fair value and its carrying value. If quoted market prices are not available, the Company will estimate fair value using a discounted value of estimated future cash flows. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the goods to customers. The Company's global payment terms are typically between 30 to 90 days. Provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns and discounts to customers are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales. The liability is recognized within Accrued Rebates, Returns, and Promotions on the consolidated balance sheet. Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants, as well as market conditions, including consideration of competitor pricing. Rebates are estimated based on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served. A significant portion of the liability related to rebates is from the sale of the Company's pharmaceutical products within the U.S., primarily t he Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid programs, which amounted to $ 7.0 billion and $ 5.8 billion as of December 29, 2019 and December 30, 2018, respectively. The Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through the analysis of wholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally generated information. Sales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals. Sales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in the field, or in specific areas, product recall. The sales returns reserve is based on historical return trends by product and by market as a percent to gross sales. In accordance with the Company’s accounting policies, the Company generally issues credit to customers for returned goods. The Company’s sales returns reserves are accounted for in accordance with the U.S. GAAP guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns reserves are recorded at full sales value. Sales returns in the Consumer and Pharmaceutical segments are almost exclusively not resalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the Medical Devices segment are typically resalable but are not material. The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products. The sales returns reserve for the total Company has been approximately 1.0 % of annual net trade sales during the fiscal reporting years 2019 , 2018 and 2017 . Promotional programs, such as product listing allowances and cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in the same period as related sales. Continuing promotional programs include coupons and volume-based sales incentive programs. The redemption cost of consumer coupons is based on historical redemption experience by product and value. Volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales volumes for the incentive period and are recorded as products are sold. These arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred or recorded as a reduction of revenue. The Company also earns profit-share payments through collaborative arrangements for certain products, which are included in 43 sales to customers. For all years presented, profit-share payments were approximately 2.0 % of the total revenues and are included in sales to customers. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further disaggregation of revenue. Shipping and Handling Shipping and handling costs incurred were $ 1.0 billion , $ 1.1 billion and $ 1.0 billion in 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively, and are included in selling, marketing and administrative expense. The amount of revenue received for shipping and handling is less than 0.5 % of sales to customers for all periods presented. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value determined by the first-in, first-out method. Intangible Assets and Goodwill The authoritative literature on U.S. GAAP requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives be assessed annually for impairment. The Company completed its annual impairment test for 2019 in the fiscal fourth quarter. Future impairment tests will be performed annually in the fiscal fourth quarter, or sooner if warranted. Purchased in-process research and development is accounted for as an indefinite lived intangible asset until the underlying project is completed, at which point the intangible asset will be accounted for as a definite lived intangible asset, or abandoned, at which point the intangible asset will be written off or partially impaired. Intangible assets that have finite useful lives continue to be amortized over their useful lives, and are reviewed for impairment when warranted by economic conditions. See Note 5 for further details on Intangible Assets and Goodwill. Financial Instruments As required by U.S. GAAP, all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Fair value is the exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is a market-based measurement determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The authoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value, with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction. The Company documents all relationships between hedged items and derivatives. The overall risk management strategy includes reasons for undertaking hedge transactions and entering into derivatives. The objectives of this strategy are: (1) minimize foreign currency exposure’s impact on the Company’s financial performance; (2) protect the Company’s cash flow from adverse movements in foreign exchange rates; (3) ensure the appropriateness of financial instruments; and (4) manage the enterprise risk associated with financial institutions. See Note 6 for additional information on Financial Instruments. Product Liability Accruals for product liability claims are recorded, on an undiscounted basis, when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information and actuarially determined estimates where applicable. The accruals are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available. The Company accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to defend each matter when those costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. To the extent adverse verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals in the self insurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated. Research and Development Research and development expenses are expensed as incurred in accordance with ASC 730, Research and Development. Upfront and milestone payments made to third parties in connection with research and development collaborations are expensed as incurred up to the point of regulatory approval. Payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related product. Amounts capitalized for such payments are included in other intangibles, net of accumulated amortization. The Company enters into collaborative arrangements, typically with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies, to develop and commercialize drug candidates or intellectual property. These arrangements typically involve two (or more) parties who are active participants in the collaboration and are exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of the activities. These collaborations usually involve various activities by one or more parties, including research and development, marketing and selling and distribution. Often, these collaborations require upfront, milestone and royalty or profit 44 share payments, contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development. Amounts due from collaborative partners related to development activities are generally reflected as a reduction of research and development expense because the performance of contract development services is not central to the Company’s operations. In general, the income statement presentation for these collaborations is as follows: Nature/Type of Collaboration Statement of Earnings Presentation Third-party sale of product & profit share payments received Sales to customers Royalties/milestones paid to collaborative partner (post-regulatory approval)* Cost of products sold Royalties received from collaborative partner Other income (expense), net Upfront payments & milestones paid to collaborative partner (pre-regulatory approval) Research and development expense Research and development payments to collaborative partner Research and development expense Research and development payments received from collaborative partner Reduction of Research and development expense * Milestones are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to cost of products sold over the useful life. For all years presented, there was no individual project that represented greater than 5 % of the total annual consolidated research and development expense. The Company has a number of products and compounds developed in collaboration with strategic partners including XARELTO ® , co-developed with Bayer HealthCare AG and IMBRUVICA ® , developed in collaboration and co-marketed with Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie company. Separately, the Company has a number of licensing arrangements for products and compounds including DARZALEX ® , licensed from Genmab A/S. Advertising Costs associated with advertising are expensed in the year incurred and are included in selling, marketing and administrative expenses. Advertising expenses worldwide, which comprised television, radio, print media and Internet advertising, were $ 2.2 billion , $ 2.6 billion and $ 2.5 billion in 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Income Taxes Income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and include the results of any difference between U.S. GAAP accounting and tax reporting, recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities. The Company estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on enacted tax regulations and rates. Future changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. The Company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company follows U.S. GAAP which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Management believes that changes in these estimates would not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial position. In January 2018, the FASB issued guidance that allows companies to elect as an accounting policy whether to record the tax effects of the global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) in the period the tax liability is generated (i.e., “period cost”) or provide for deferred tax assets and liabilities related to basis differences that exist and are expected to effect the amount of GILTI inclusion in future years upon reversal (i.e., “deferred method”). In fiscal 2018, the Company elected to account for GILTI under the deferred method. The deferred tax amounts recorded are based on the evaluation of temporary differences that are expected to reverse as GILTI is incurred in future periods. The Company has recorded deferred tax liabilities on all undistributed earnings prior to December 31, 2017 from its international subsidiaries. The Company has not provided deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings subsequent to January 1, 2018 from certain international subsidiaries where the earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. The Company intends to continue to reinvest these earnings in those international operations. If the Company decides at a later date to repatriate these earnings to the U.S., the Company would be required to provide for the net tax effects on these amounts. The Company estimates that the total tax effect of this repatriation would be approximately $ 0.8 billion under current enacted tax laws and regulations and at current currency exchange rates. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding income taxes. 45 Net Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities were exercised or converted into common stock using the treasury stock method. Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Estimates are used when accounting for sales discounts, rebates, allowances and incentives, product liabilities, income taxes, withholding taxes, depreciation, amortization, employee benefits, contingencies and intangible asset and liability valuations. Actual results may or may not differ from those estimates. The Company follows the provisions of U.S. GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies. A liability is recorded when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. The best estimate of a loss within a range is accrued; however, if no estimate in the range is better than any other, the minimum amount is accrued. Annual Closing Date The Company follows the concept of a fiscal year, which ends on the Sunday nearest to the end of the month of December. Normally each fiscal year consists of 52 weeks, but every five or six years the fiscal year consists of 53 weeks , and therefore includes additional shipping days, as was the case in 2015, and will be the case again in 2020. Reclassification Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation. 2.

The Company capitalizes interest expense as part of the cost of construction of facilities and equipment. Interest expense capitalized in 2019 , 2018 and 2017 was $ 70 million , $ 86 million and $ 94 million , respectively. Depreciation expense, including the amortization of capitalized interest in 2019 , 2018 and 2017 was $ 2.5 billion , $ 2.6 billion and $ 2.6 billion , respectively. Upon retirement or other disposal of property, plant and equipment, the costs and related amounts of accumulated depreciation or amortization are eliminated from the asset and accumulated depreciation accounts, respectively. The difference, if any, between the net asset value and the proceeds are recorded in earnings. 5. Intangible Assets and Goodwill At the end of 2019 and 2018 , the gross and net amounts of intangible assets were: (Dollars in Millions) 2019 2018 Intangible assets with definite lives: Patents and trademarks — gross $ 36,634 35,194 Less accumulated amortization 13,154 9,784 Patents and trademarks — net $ 23,480 25,410 Customer relationships and other intangibles — gross $ 22,056 21,334 Less accumulated amortization 9,462 8,323 Customer relationships and other intangibles — net* $ 12,594 13,011 Intangible assets with indefinite lives: Trademarks $ 6,922 6,937 Purchased in-process research and development (1) 4,647 2,253 Total intangible assets with indefinite lives $ 11,569 9,190 Total intangible assets — net $ 47,643 47,611 *The majority is comprised of customer relationships (1) In the fiscal year 2019, the Company completed the acquisition of Auris Health, Inc. and recorded an in-process research and development intangible asset of $ 2.9 billion . Additionally, in the fiscal first quarter of 2019, the Company recorded an IPR&D impairment charge of $ 0.9 billion for the remaining intangible asset value related to the development program of AL-8176, an investigational drug for the treatment of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) acquired with the 2014 acquisition of Alios Biopharma Inc. The impairment charge was based on additional information, including clinical data, which became available and led to the Company's decision to abandon the development of AL-8176. A partial impairment charge of $ 0.8 billion was previously recorded in the fiscal third quarter 2018 related to the development program of AL-8176. 48 Goodwill as of December 29, 2019 and December 30, 2018 , as allocated by segment of business, was as follows: (Dollars in Millions) Consumer Pharmaceutical Medical Devices Total Goodwill at December 31, 2017 $ 8,875 9,109 13,922 31,906 Goodwill, related to acquisitions 168 51 184 403 Goodwill, related to divestitures — — ( 1,348 ) (1) ( 1,348 ) Currency translation/other ( 373 ) ( 97 ) ( 38 ) ( 508 ) Goodwill at December 30, 2018 $ 8,670 9,063 12,720 30,453 Goodwill, related to acquisitions 1,188 75 2,018 3,281 Currency translation/other ( 122 ) 31 ( 4 ) ( 95 ) Goodwill at December 29, 2019 $ 9,736 9,169 14,734 33,639 (1) Goodwill of $ 1.0 billion is related to the divestiture of the LifeScan business.

Fair Value Measurements The Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to manage its exposure to the variability of cash flows, primarily related to the foreign exchange rate changes of future intercompany products and third-party purchases of materials denominated in a foreign currency. The Company uses cross currency interest rate swaps to manage currency risk primarily related to borrowings. Both types of derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges. Additionally, the Company uses interest rate swaps as an instrument to manage interest rate risk related to fixed rate borrowings. These derivatives are designated as fair value hedges. The Company uses cross currency interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges. Additionally, the Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to offset its exposure to certain foreign currency assets and liabilities. These forward foreign exchange contracts are not designated as hedges and therefore, changes in the fair values of these derivatives are recognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the related foreign currency assets and liabilities. The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes, or that contain credit risk related contingent features. The Company maintains credit support agreements (CSA) with certain derivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on respective credit ratings and netting agreements. As of December 29, 2019 , the total amount of cash collateral held by the Company under the credit support agreements (CSA) amounted to $ 255 million net, primarily related to net investment hedges. On an ongoing basis, the Company monitors counter-party credit ratings. The Company considers credit non-performance risk to be low, because the Company primarily enters into agreements with commercial institutions that have at least an investment grade credit rating. Refer to the table on significant financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value contained in this footnote for receivables and payables with these commercial institutions. As of December 29, 2019 , the Company had notional amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange contracts, and cross currency interest rate swaps of $ 45.3 billion , and $ 20.1 billion respectively. As of December 30, 2018 , the Company 49 had notional amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange contracts, cross currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps of $ 41.1 billion , $ 7.3 billion , and $ 0.5 billion respectively. All derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction. The designation as a cash flow hedge is made at the entrance date of the derivative contract. At inception, all derivatives are expected to be highly effective. Foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges are accounted for under the forward method and all gains/losses associated with these contracts will be recognized in the income statement when the hedged item impacts earnings. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income until the underlying transaction affects earnings, and are then reclassified to earnings in the same account as the hedged transaction. Gains and losses associated with interest rate swaps and changes in fair value of hedged debt attributable to changes in interest rates are recorded to interest expense in the period in which they occur. The effect of which are immaterial for the fiscal years ended December 29, 2019 and December 30, 2018 . Gains and losses on net investment hedge are accounted through the currency translation account within accumulated other comprehensive income. The portion excluded from effectiveness testing is recorded through interest (income) expense using the spot method. On an ongoing basis, the Company assesses whether each derivative continues to be highly effective in offsetting changes of hedged items. If and when a derivative is no longer expected to be highly effective, hedge accounting is discontinued. The Company designated its Euro denominated notes issued in May 2016 with due dates ranging from 2022 to 2035 as a net investment hedge of the Company's investments in certain of its international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their functional currency in order to reduce the volatility caused by changes in exchange rates. As of December 29, 2019 , the balance of deferred net loss on derivatives included in accumulated other comprehensive income was $ 295 million after-tax. For additional information, see the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and Note 13. The Company expects that substantially all of the amounts related to forward foreign exchange contracts will be reclassified into earnings over the next 12 months as a result of transactions that are expected to occur over that period. The maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging transaction exposure is 18 months , excluding interest rate contracts, net investment hedges. The amount ultimately realized in earnings may differ as foreign exchange rates change. Realized gains and losses are ultimately determined by actual exchange rates at maturity of the derivative. 50 The following table is a summary of the activity related to derivatives and hedges for the fiscal years ended December 29, 2019 and December 30, 2018 , net of tax: December 29, 2019 December 30, 2018 (Dollars in Millions) Sales Cost of Products Sold R&D Expense Interest (Income) Expense Other (Income) Expense Sales Cost of Products Sold R&D Expense Interest (Income) Expense Other (Income) Expense The effects of fair value, net investment and cash flow hedging: Gain (Loss) on net investment hedging relationship: Cross currency interest rate swaps contracts: Amount of gain or (loss) recognized in income on derivative amount excluded from effectiveness testing — — — 159 — — — — 56 — Amount of gain or (loss) recognized in AOCI — — — 159 — — — — 56 — Gain (Loss) on cash flow hedging relationship: Forward foreign exchange contracts: Amount of gain or (loss) reclassified from AOCI into income ( 54 ) ( 321 ) ( 105 ) — 22 47 200 ( 220 ) — ( 24 ) Amount of gain or (loss) recognized in AOCI ( 20 ) ( 606 ) ( 94 ) — 39 ( 32 ) ( 17 ) ( 193 ) — ( 4 ) Cross currency interest rate swaps contracts: Amount of gain or (loss) reclassified from AOCI into income — — — 292 — — — — 133 — Amount of gain or (loss) recognized in AOCI $ — — — 415 — — — — 117 — For the fiscal years ended December 29, 2019 and December 30, 2018 , the following amounts were recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet Line item in the Consolidated Balance Sheet in which the hedged item is included Carrying Amount of the Hedged Liability Cumulative Amount of Fair Value Hedging Adjustment Included in the Carrying Amount of the Hedged Liability (Dollars in Millions) December 29, 2019 December 30, 2018 December 29, 2019 December 30, 2018 Current Portion of Long-term Debt $ — 494 — 5 51 The following table is the effect of derivatives not designated as hedging instrument for the fiscal years ended December 29, 2019 and December 30, 2018: (Dollars in Millions) Location of Gain /(Loss) Recognized in Income on Derivative Gain/(Loss) Recognized In Income on Derivative Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments December 29, 2019 December 30, 2018 Foreign Exchange Contracts Other (income) expense ( 144 ) ( 68 ) The following table is the effect of net investment hedges for the fiscal years ended December 29, 2019 and December 30, 2018: Gain/(Loss) Recognized In Accumulated OCI Location of Gain or (Loss) Reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income Into Income Gain/(Loss) Reclassified From Accumulated OCI Into Income (Dollars in Millions) December 29, 2019 December 30, 2018 December 29, 2019 December 30, 2018 Debt $ 121 218 Interest (income) expense — — Cross Currency interest rate swaps $ 488 150 Interest (income) expense — — The Company holds equity investments with readily determinable fair values and equity investments without readily determinable fair values. The Company measures equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. The following table is a summary of the activity related to equity investments for the fiscal years ended December 29, 2019 and December 30, 2018 : December 30, 2018 December 29, 2019 (Dollars in Millions) Carrying Value Changes in Fair Value Reflected in Net Income (1) Sales/ Purchases/Other (2) Carrying Value Non Current Other Assets Equity Investments with readily determinable value $ 511 533 104 1,148 1,148 Equity Investments without readily determinable value $ 681 ( 38 ) 69 712 712 December 31, 2017 December 30, 2018 (Dollars in Millions) Carrying Value Changes in Fair Value Reflected in Net Income (1) Sales/ Purchases/Other (2) Carrying Value Non Current Other Assets Equity Investments with readily determinable value $ 751 ( 247 ) 7 511 511 Equity Investments without readily determinable value $ 510 13 158 681 681 (1) Recorded in Other Income/Expense (2) Other includes impact of currency 52 For the fiscal years ended December 29, 2019 and December 30, 2018 for equity investments without readily determinable market values, $ 57 million and $ 54 million respectively, of the changes in fair value reflected in net income were the result of impairments. There were $ 19 million and $ 67 million respectively, of changes in fair value reflected in net income due to changes in observable prices. Fair value is the exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is a market-based measurement determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. In accordance with ASC 820, a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels within the hierarchy are described below with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest. The fair value of a derivative financial instrument (i.e., forward foreign exchange contracts, interest rate contracts) is the aggregation by currency of all future cash flows discounted to its present value at the prevailing market interest rates and subsequently converted to the U.S. Dollar at the current spot foreign exchange rate. The Company does not believe that fair values of these derivative instruments materially differ from the amounts that could be realized upon settlement or maturity, or that the changes in fair value will have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position. The Company also holds equity investments which are classified as Level 1 and debt securities which are classified as Level 2. The Company holds acquisition related contingent liabilities based upon certain regulatory and commercial events, which are classified as Level 3, whose values are determined using discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques for which the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimations. The following three levels of inputs are used to measure fair value: Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. Level 2 — Significant other observable inputs. Level 3 — Significant unobservable inputs. The Company’s significant financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value as of the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019 and December 30, 2018 were as follows: 2019 2018 (Dollars in Millions) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Total (1) Derivatives designated as hedging instruments: Assets: Forward foreign exchange contracts $ — 209 — 209 501 Interest rate contracts (2)(4) — 693 — 693 161 Total — 902 — 902 662 Liabilities: Forward foreign exchange contracts — 426 — 426 548 Interest rate contracts (3)(4) — 193 — 193 292 Total — 619 — 619 840 Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments: Assets: Forward foreign exchange contracts — 23 — 23 32 Liabilities: Forward foreign exchange contracts — 33 — 33 32 Available For Sale Other Investments: Equity investments (5) 1,148 — — 1,148 511 Debt securities (6) $ — 4,368 — 4,368 9,734 Other Liabilities Contingent Consideration (7) 1,715 1,715 397 53 Gross to Net Derivative Reconciliation 2019 2018 (Dollars in Millions) Total Gross Assets $ 925 694 Credit Support Agreement (CSA) ( 841 ) ( 423 ) Total Net Asset 84 271 Total Gross Liabilities 652 872 Credit Support Agreement (CSA) ( 586 ) ( 605 ) Total Net Liabilities $ 66 267 Summarized information about changes in liabilities for contingent consideration is as follows: 2019 2018 2017 (Dollars in Millions) Beginning Balance 397 600 378 Changes in estimated fair value (8) 151 ( 156 ) 87 Additions 1,246 125 160 Payments ( 79 ) ( 172 ) ( 25 ) Ending Balance 1,715 397 600 (1) 2018 assets and liabilities are all classified as Level 2 with the exception of equity investments of $ 511 million , which are classified as Level 1 and contingent consideration of $ 397 million , classified as Level 3.

Fair value of the long-term debt was estimated using market prices, which were corroborated by quoted broker prices and significant other observable inputs. The Company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous banks worldwide. In September 2019 , the Company secured a new 364-day Credit Facility. Total credit available to the Company approximates $ 10 billion , which expires on September 10, 2020 . Interest charged on borrowings under the credit line agreements is based on either bids provided by banks, the prime rate, London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR) or other applicable market rate as allowed under the terms of the agreement, plus applicable margins. Commitment fees under the agreements are not material. Throughout 2019, the Company continued to have access to liquidity through the commercial paper market. Short-term borrowings and the current portion of long-term debt amounted to approximately $ 1.2 billion at the end of 2019 , of which $ 1.1 billion is the current portion of the long-term debt, and the remainder principally represents local borrowing by international subsidiaries. Throughout 2018, the Company continued to have access to liquidity through the commercial paper market. Short-term borrowings and the current portion of long-term debt amounted to approximately $ 2.8 billion at the end of 2018, of which $ 2.6 billion is the current portion of the long term debt, and the remainder principally represents local borrowing by international subsidiaries.

International operations reflects the impacts of operations in jurisdictions with statutory tax rates different than the U.S., particularly Ireland, Switzerland and Puerto Rico, which is a favorable impact on the effective tax rate as compared with the U.S. statutory rate. The 2017 amount also includes tax cost related to the revaluation of deferred tax balances related to the change in the Belgian statutory tax rate increasing the tax provision by approximately 3.4 % . (2) Includes the impact of the GILTI tax, the Foreign-Derived Intangible Income deduction and other foreign income that is taxable under the U.S. tax code. (3) Represents impact of adjustments to balances originally recorded as part of the 2017 TCJA provisional tax charge. Further information provided below. (4) Includes U.S. state and local taxes provisionally recorded as part TCJA provisional charge which was approximately 0.6 % of the total effective tax rate. The 2019 tax rate decreased by 2.3 % compared to the fiscal year 2018 tax rate. In addition to the impact of Swiss tax reform discussed in more detail below, the primary drivers of the net decrease were as follows: • The Company reorganized the ownership structure of certain wholly-owned international subsidiaries in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2019, which resulted in a reduction of certain withholding and local taxes that it had previously recognized as part of the provisional Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) tax charge in the fiscal year 2017 and finalized in the fiscal year 2018. Following the completion of this restructuring and approval by the applicable local authorities, the Company reversed a deferred tax liability of $ 0.6 billion and a related deferred tax asset of $ 0.2 billion for U.S. foreign tax credits, for a net deferred tax benefit of $ 0.4 billion decreasing the annual effective tax rate by 2.2 % . This benefit has been reflected as “TCJA and related impacts” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation. • The impact of the agreement in principle to settle opioid litigation for $ 4 billion (see Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) which reduced the U.S. earnings before taxes at an effective tax rate of 23.5 % and decreased the Company’s annual effective tax rate by approximately 2.1 % . • In December of fiscal year 2019, the U.S. Treasury issued final foreign tax credit regulations, which resulted in the Company revising the amount of foreign tax credits that were initially recorded in the fiscal year 2017 as part of the provisional TCJA tax charge. As a result, the Company recorded an increased deferred tax asset related to these foreign tax credits of approximately $ 0.3 billion or 1.7 % to the annual effective tax rate. This benefit has been reflected as “TCJA and related impacts” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation. • The Company reassessed its uncertain tax positions related to the current IRS audit and increased its unrecognized tax benefit by $ 0.3 billion liability which increased the annual effective tax rate by approximately 1.5 % (see section on Unrecognized Tax Benefits for additional information). As these positions were related to uncertain tax regarding international transfer pricing, this expense has been classified as “International Operations” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation. Subsequent to December 29, 2019, the Company received and agreed to Notices of Proposed Adjustments (NOPAs) from the IRS. The Company believes it is adequately reserved for potential exposures. • There were several one-time tax impacts that resulted in a cumulative net tax benefit to the 2018 annual effective tax rate of 1.2 % . These items included the LifeScan divestiture, the adjustment to the 2017 provisional TCJA tax charge and the acceleration of certain tax deductions as part of the 2017 tax return. • More income in higher tax jurisdictions relative to lower tax jurisdictions as compared to 2018. On September 28, 2018 the Swiss Parliament approved the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (TRAF). On May 19, 2019 a public referendum was held in Switzerland that approved the federal reform proposals. In the fiscal third quarter of 2019, the Swiss Federal Council enacted TRAF which became effective on January 1, 2020. The Federal transitional provisions 57 of TRAF allow companies, under certain conditions, to adjust their tax basis adjustments to fair value (i.e., “step-up”) which is used for tax depreciation and amortization purposes resulting in a deduction over the transitional period. The subsequent adjustment to the Company’s asset tax basis will require review and approval by the tax authorities. TRAF also provides for parameters which enable the Swiss cantons to establish localized tax rates and regulations for companies. The new cantonal tax parameters include favorable tax benefits for patents and additional research and development tax deductions. The cantonal transitional provisions of TRAF are also expected to allow companies to elect either 1) tax basis step-up similar to the Federal transition benefit or 2) alternative statutory tax rate for a period not to exceed 5 years. The Company currently has operations located in various Swiss cantons and enactment may not be uniform in both the substantive nature of the legislation and the timing of enactment. The Company recorded a net tax expense of $ 0.1 billion which increased the effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2019 by approximately 0.6 % . This net tax expense related to federal and certain cantonal enactments in the fiscal year 2019 consisting of the following provisions: • approximately $ 0.6 billion tax expense relating to the remeasurement of Swiss deferred tax assets and liabilities for the change in the Federal and cantonal tax rates, where enactment occurred by December 29, 2019; this expense has been reflected as “International Operations” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation. • a $ 0.9 billion deferred tax asset related to the estimated value of a Federal tax basis step-up of the Company’s Swiss subsidiaries’ assets; this benefit has been reflected as “International Operations” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation. • approximately $ 450 million of U.S. deferred tax expense relating to the GILTI deferred tax liability resulting from the remeasurement of the Swiss deferred tax assets and liabilities and the new deferred tax asset for the Federal step-up. this benefit has been reflected as “U.S. tax on international income” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation. In the fiscal fourth quarter of 2019, the Swiss Federal Tax Administration issued authoritative guidance that required the Company to decrease the estimated value of the Federal tax basis step-up by approximately $ 0.3 billion from the determination made in the fiscal third quarter of 2019. Further authoritative guidance from the relevant Swiss tax authorities may be issued in the future and additional revisions may be required in the fiscal period that they are issued. The Company is currently assessing and applying for approval for the elective transition provisions in several cantons which includes discussions with local tax authorities on the application of the new law. The Company has recorded an estimated impact of the transitional provisions based on the best available information for cantons where enactment has occurred but the Company has not yet received a final tax ruling. As of December 29, 2019, the one canton where the Company maintains significant operations has not yet enacted TRAF legislation and the amounts recorded in the fiscal year 2019 do not include estimates for unenacted legislation. On February 9, 2020 a public referendum on the legislative change was held in this canton and the legislation was approved by the voters; formal enactment is expected in the fiscal first half of 2020. The Company has not yet elected the transitional provision in this canton. However, the net financial benefit is estimated to be between $ 0.2 billion and $ 0.5 billion in the fiscal first half of 2020. U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) (2018 and 2017) In the fiscal year 2017, the United States enacted into law new U.S. tax legislation, the TCJA. This law included provisions for a comprehensive overhaul of the corporate income tax code, including a reduction of the statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% , effective on January 1, 2018. This legislation also eliminated or reduced certain corporate income tax deductions as well as introduced new provisions that taxed certain foreign income not previously taxed by the United States. The TCJA also included a provision for a tax on all previously undistributed earnings of U.S. companies located in foreign jurisdictions. Undistributed earnings in the form of cash and cash equivalents were taxed at a rate of 15.5 % and all other earnings were taxed at a rate of 8.0 % . This tax is payable over 8 years and will not accrue interest. These payments began in 2018 and will continue through 2025. The remaining balance at the end of the fiscal year 2019 was approximately $ 8.2 billion , of which $ 7.7 billion is classified as noncurrent and reflected as “Long-term taxes payable” on the Company’s balance sheet. The balance of this account is related to receivables from tax authorities not expected to be received in the next 12 months. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recorded a provisional tax cost of approximately $ 13.0 billion which consisted primarily of the following components: • a $ 10.1 billion charge on previously undistributed foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017 • a $ 4.5 billion deferred tax liability for foreign local and withholding taxes, offset by a $ 1.1 billion deferred tax asset for U.S. foreign tax credits, for repatriation of substantially all those earnings 58 • a $ 0.6 billion tax benefit relating to the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities and the impact of the TCJA on unrecognized tax benefits • a $ 0.1 billion charge for U.S. state and local taxes on the repatriation of these foreign earnings In the fiscal year 2018, the Company completed its full assessment and finalized the accounting for the impact of the TCJA. The Company recorded net adjustments to the above components of the provisional charge of approximately $ 0.2 billion . These revisions were based on updated estimates and additional analysis by management as well as applying interpretative guidance issued by the U.S. Department of Treasury to the facts and circumstances that existed as of the TCJA enactment date. This charge was primarily related to additional deferred tax liabilities for foreign local and withholding taxes for the remaining balance of undistributed foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017 that were not provided for in the 2017 provisional charge. The TCJA also includes provisions for a tax on GILTI. GILTI is described as the excess of a U.S. shareholder’s total net foreign income over a deemed return on tangible assets, as provided by the TCJA. In the fiscal year 2018, the Company elected to treat GILTI as a period expense under the deferred method and recorded a deferred tax cost of approximately $ 1.4 billion in the fiscal year 2018 related to facts and circumstances that existed on the date of TCJA enactment. See Note 1 for further information regarding income taxes accounting policies. During 2018, the Company reorganized the ownership structure of certain foreign subsidiaries which resulted in a reduction of certain foreign withholding taxes that it had recognized as part of the provisional TCJA tax charge in the fourth quarter of 2017. Following the completion of this restructuring and as a result of clarification by Swiss tax authorities regarding the applicability of withholding tax to repatriation of certain earnings, the Company reversed a deferred tax liability of $ 2.8 billion and a related deferred tax asset of $ 0.9 billion for U.S. foreign tax credits, for a net deferred tax benefit of $ 1.9 billion . This benefit has been reflected as “TCJA and related impacts” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation. The 2018 effective tax rate decreased by 77.6 % compared to 2017. The 2017 effective tax rate was primarily driven by the approximately $ 13 billion provisional tax charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 and the impact of a Belgian statutory tax rate change which increased the 2017 effective rate by 3.4 % . Additional drivers of the 2018 annual effective tax were: • the reduction of the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate including the effects of tax elections which resulted in the acceleration of certain deductions into the 2017 tax return. The impact of these accelerated deductions decreased the annual effective tax rate by approximately 1.7 % • the impact of the adjustments to the 2017 provisional TCJA charge, including both Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 118 adjustments and the internal restructuring, decreased the effective tax rate by approximately 1.9 % • GILTI tax which increased the annual effective tax rate by approximately 1.6 % , which excludes the impact of the SAB 118 adjustment for the adoption of the deferred method for GILTI • tax benefits received from stock-based compensation during fiscal 2018 and 2017, reduced the effective tax rate by 1.5 % and 2.0 % , respectively • in the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company completed the divestiture of its LifeScan business (See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), which increased the Company's annual effective tax rate by approximately 0.8 % • more income in higher tax jurisdictions relative to lower tax jurisdictions as compared to 2017 59 Te mporary differences and carryforwards for 2019 and 2018 were as follows: 2019 Deferred Tax 2018 Deferred Tax (Dollars in Millions) Asset Liability Asset Liability Employee related obligations $ 2,393 2,398 Stock based compensation 546 639 Depreciation & amortization 1,122 1,784 Non-deductible intangibles ( 5,752 ) ( 5,967 ) International R&D capitalized for tax 1,189 1,282 Reserves & liabilities 2,384 1,647 Income reported for tax purposes 1,605 1,104 Net operating loss carryforward international 838 786 Undistributed foreign earnings 765 ( 1,289 ) 693 ( 2,240 ) Global intangible low-taxed income ( 2,965 ) ( 2,971 ) Miscellaneous international 696 ( 81 ) 603 ( 93 ) Miscellaneous U.S. 410 469 Total deferred income taxes $ 11,948 ( 10,087 ) 11,405 ( 11,271 ) T he Company has wholly-owned international subsidiaries that have cumulative net losses. The Company believes that it is more likely than not that these subsidiaries will generate future taxable income sufficient to utilize these deferred tax assets. The following table summarizes the activity related to unrecognized tax benefits: (Dollars in Millions) 2019 2018 2017 Beginning of year $ 3,326 3,151 3,041 Increases related to current year tax positions 249 242 332 Increases related to prior period tax positions 408 145 232 Decreases related to prior period tax positions ( 105 ) ( 137 ) ( 416 ) (1) Settlements ( 9 ) ( 40 ) ( 2 ) Lapse of statute of limitations ( 16 ) ( 35 ) ( 36 ) End of year $ 3,853 3,326 3,151 (1) In 2017, $ 347 million of this decrease is related to the TCJA. The unrecognized tax benefits of $ 3.9 billion at December 29, 2019 , if recognized, would affect the Company’s annual effective tax rate. The Company conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and currently has tax audits in progress with a number of tax authorities. With respect to the United States, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has completed its audit for the tax years through 2009 and is currently auditing the tax years 2010-2012. The Company currently expects completion of this audit and settlement of the related tax liabilities in the fiscal year 2020. As of the December 29, 2019, the Company has classified unrecognized tax benefits and related interest of approximately $ 0.9 billion as a current liability on the “Accrued taxes on Income” line of the Consolidated Balance Sheet. This is the amount expected to be paid over the next 12 months with respect to the IRS audit. Subsequent to December 29, 2019, the Company made a payment for approximately $ 0.6 billion to the U.S. Treasury related to the estimated 2010-2012 tax audit liability in anticipation of the final settlement later in fiscal 2020. The completion of this tax audit may result in additional adjustments to the Company’s unrecognized tax benefit liability. In other major jurisdictions where the Company conducts business, the years that remain open to tax audit go back to the year 2006. The Company believes it is possible that tax audits may be completed over the next twelve months by taxing authorities in some jurisdictions outside of the United States. However, the Company is not able to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of any other future tax payments relating to uncertain tax positions. The Company classifies liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties as long-term liabilities, except as previously noted on amounts related to the current United States IRS audit. Interest expense and penalties related to 60 unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax expense. The Company recognized after tax interest expense of $ 50 million , $ 53 million and $ 60 million in 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The total amount of accrued interest was $ 559 million and $ 503 million in 2019 and 2018 , respectively. 9. Employee Related Obligations At the end of 2019 and 2018 , employee related obligations recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were: (Dollars in Millions) 2019 2018 Pension benefits $ 5,538 5,327 Postretirement benefits 2,297 2,283 Postemployment benefits 3,004 2,330 Deferred compensation 338 410 Total employee obligations 11,177 10,350 Less current benefits payable 514 399 Employee related obligations — non-current $ 10,663 9,951 Prepaid employee related obligations of $ 551 million and $ 475 million for 2019 and 2018 , respectively, are included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 10. Pensions and Other Benefit Plans The Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit, defined contribution and termination indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide. The Company also provides post-retirement benefits, primarily health care, to all eligible U.S. retired employees and their dependents. Many international employees are covered by government-sponsored programs and the cost to the Company is not significant. Retirement plan benefits for employees hired before January 1, 2015 are primarily based on the employee’s compensation during the last three to five years before retirement and the number of years of service. In 2014, the Company announced that the U.S. Defined Benefit Plan was amended to adopt a new benefit formula, effective for employees hired on or after January 1, 2015. The benefits are calculated using a new formula based on employee compensation over total years of service. International subsidiaries have plans under which funds are deposited with trustees, annuities are purchased under group contracts, or reserves are provided. The Company does not typically fund retiree health care benefits in advance, but may do so at its discretion. The Company also has the right to modify these plans in the future. In 2019 and 2018 the Company used December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , respectively, as the measurement date for all U.S. and international retirement and other benefit plans. Net periodic benefit costs for the Company’s defined benefit retirement plans and other benefit plans for 2019 , 2018 and 2017 include the following components: Retirement Plans Other Benefit Plans (Dollars in Millions) 2019 2018 2017 2019 2018 2017 Service cost $ 1,163 1,283 1,080 274 269 247 Interest cost 1,096 996 927 185 148 159 Expected return on plan assets ( 2,322 ) ( 2,212 ) ( 2,041 ) ( 6 ) ( 7 ) ( 6 ) Amortization of prior service cost (credit) 4 3 2 ( 31 ) ( 31 ) ( 30 ) Recognized actuarial losses 579 852 609 129 123 138 Curtailments and settlements 73 1 17 — — — Net periodic benefit cost $ 593 923 594 551 502 508 Amounts expected to be recognized in net periodic benefit cost in the coming year for the Company’s defined benefit retirement plans and other post-retirement plans: 61 (Dollars in Millions) Amortization of net transition obligation $ — Amortization of net actuarial losses 1,022 Amortization of prior service credit 29 Unrecognized gains and losses for the U.S. pension plans are amortized over the average remaining future service for each plan. For plans with no active employees, they are amortized over the average life expectancy. The amortization of gains and losses for the other U.S. benefit plans is determined by using a 10 % corridor of the greater of the market value of assets or the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation. Total unamortized gains and losses in excess of the corridor are amortized over the average remaining future service. Prior service costs/benefits for the U.S. pension plans are amortized over the average remaining future service of plan participants at the time of the plan amendment. Prior service cost/benefit for the other U.S. benefit plans is amortized over the average remaining service to full eligibility age of plan participants at the time of the plan amendment. The following table represents the weighted-average actuarial assumptions: Retirement Plans Other Benefit Plans Worldwide Benefit Plans 2019 2018 2017 2019 2018 2017 Net Periodic Benefit Cost Service cost discount rate 3.63 % 3.20 3.59 4.45 3.85 4.63 Interest cost discount rate 4.13 % 3.60 3.98 4.25 3.62 3.94 Rate of increase in compensation levels 3.99 % 3.98 4.01 4.29 4.29 4.31 Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets 8.31 % 8.46 8.43 Benefit Obligation Discount rate 2.91 % 3.76 3.30 3.39 4.40 3.78 Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.01 % 3.97 3.99 4.29 4.29 4.30 The Company’s discount rates are determined by considering current yield curves representing high quality, long-term fixed income instruments. The resulting discount rates are consistent with the duration of plan liabilities. The Company's methodology in determining service and interest cost uses duration specific spot rates along that yield curve to the plans' liability cash flows. The expected rates of return on plan asset assumptions represent the Company's assessment of long-term returns on diversified investment portfolios globally. The assessment is determined using projections from external financial sources, long-term historical averages, actual returns by asset class and the various asset class allocations by market.

International Plans are funded in accordance with local regulations. Additional discretionary contributions are made when deemed appropriate to meet the long-term obligations of the plans. For certain plans, funding is not a common practice, as funding provides no economic benefit. Consequently, the Company has several pension plans that are not funded. In 2019 , the Company contributed $ 489 million and $ 419 million to its U.S. and international pension plans, respectively. The following table displays the funded status of the Company's U.S. Qualified & Non-Qualified pension plans and international funded and unfunded pension plans at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively: U.S. Plans International Plans Qualified Plans Non-Qualified Plans Funded Plans Unfunded Plans (Dollars in Millions) 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018 Plan Assets $ 21,398 17,725 — — 10,803 9,093 — — Projected Benefit Obligation 22,034 18,609 2,544 2,176 12,132 10,467 478 418 Accumulated Benefit Obligation 19,831 16,851 2,115 1,793 11,040 9,510 430 379 Over (Under) Funded Status Projected Benefit Obligation $ ( 636 ) ( 884 ) ( 2,544 ) ( 2,176 ) ( 1,329 ) ( 1,374 ) ( 478 ) ( 418 ) Accumulated Benefit Obligation 1,567 874 ( 2,115 ) ( 1,793 ) ( 237 ) ( 417 ) ( 430 ) ( 379 ) Plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets have an accumulated benefit obligation, projected benefit obligation and plan assets of $ 4.3 billion , $ 5.2 billion and $ 0.9 billion , respectively, at the end of 2019 , and $ 7.5 billion , $ 8.8 billion and $ 4.3 billion , respectively, at the end of 2018 .

In determining investment policies, strategies and goals, each committee or board considers factors including, local pension rules and regulations; local tax regulations; availability of investment vehicles (separate accounts, commingled accounts, insurance funds, etc.); funded status of the plans; ratio of actives to retirees; duration of liabilities; and other relevant factors including: diversification, liquidity of local markets and liquidity of base currency. A majority of the Company’s pension funds are open to new entrants and are expected to be on-going plans. Permitted investments are primarily liquid and/or listed, with little reliance on illiquid and non-traditional investments such as hedge funds. The Company’s retirement plan asset allocation at the end of 2019 and 2018 and target allocations for 2020 are as follows: Percent of Plan Assets Target Allocation 2019 2018 2020 Worldwide Retirement Plans Equity securities 74 % 71 % 69 % Debt securities 26 29 31 Total plan assets 100 % 100 % 100 % Determination of Fair Value of Plan Assets The Plan has an established and well-documented process for determining fair values. Fair value is based upon quoted market prices, where available. If listed prices or quotes are not available, fair value is based upon models that primarily use, as inputs, market-based or independently sourced market parameters, including yield curves, interest rates, volatilities, equity or debt prices, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. While the Plan believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. Valuation Hierarchy The authoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels within the hierarchy are described in the table below with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest. The Net Asset Value (NAV) is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, minus its liabilities, and then divided by the number of shares outstanding. A financial instrument’s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the investments measured at fair value. • Short-term investment funds — Cash and quoted short-term instruments are valued at the closing price or the amount held on deposit by the custodian bank. Other investments are through investment vehicles valued using the NAV provided by the administrator of the fund. The NAV is a quoted price in a market that is not active and classified as Level 2. • Government and agency securities — A limited number of these investments are valued at the closing price reported on the major market on which the individual securities are traded. Where quoted prices are available in an active market, the investments are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. If quoted market prices are not available for the specific security, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows. When quoted market prices for a security are not available in an active market, they are classified as Level 2. • Debt instruments — A limited number of these investments are valued at the closing price reported on the major market on which the individual securities are traded. Where quoted prices are available in an active market, the investments are classified as Level 1. If quoted market prices are not available for the specific security, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows and are classified as Level 2. Level 3 debt instruments are priced based on unobservable inputs. • Equity securities — Equity securities are valued at the closing price reported on the major market on which the individual securities are traded. Substantially all equity securities are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. • Commingled funds — These investment vehicles are valued using the NAV provided by the fund administrator. Assets in the Level 2 category have a quoted market price. 65 • Insurance contracts — The instruments are issued by insurance companies. The fair value is based on negotiated value and the underlying investments held in separate account portfolios as well as considering the credit worthiness of the issuer. The underlying investments are government, asset-backed and fixed income securities. In general, insurance contracts are classified as Level 3 as there are no quoted prices nor other observable inputs for pricing. • Other assets — Other assets are represented primarily by limited partnerships. These investment vehicles are valued using the NAV provided by the fund administrator. Other assets that are exchange listed and actively traded are classified as Level 1, while inactively traded assets are classified as Level 2. The following table sets forth the Retirement Plans' investments measured at fair value as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018: Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets Significant Other Observable Inputs Significant Unobservable Inputs (a) Investments Measured at Net Asset Value (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Total Assets (Dollars in Millions) 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018 Short-term investment funds $ 119 122 405 529 — — — — 524 651 Government and agency securities — — 4,140 3,595 — — — — 4,140 3,595 Debt instruments — — 3,452 3,105 — — — — 3,452 3,105 Equity securities 12,483 11,298 2 4 — — — — 12,485 11,302 Commingled funds — — 3,338 2,304 181 133 7,580 5,201 11,099 7,638 Insurance contracts — — — — 19 193 — — 19 193 Other assets — — 9 33 — — 473 301 482 334 Investments at fair value $ 12,602 11,420 11,346 9,570 200 326 8,053 5,502 32,201 26,818 (a) The activity for the Level 3 assets is not significant for all years presented. The Company's Other Benefit Plans are unfunded except for U.S. commingled funds (Level 2) of $ 84 million and $ 72 million and U.S. short-term investment funds (Level 2) of $ 31 million and $ 108 million at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. The fair value of Johnson & Johnson Common Stock directly held in plan assets was $ 984 million ( 3.1 % of total worldwide plan assets) at December 31, 2019 and $ 876 million ( 3.3 % of total worldwide plan assets) at December 31, 2018. 11. Savings Plan The Company has voluntary 401(k) savings plans designed to enhance the existing retirement programs covering eligible employees. The Company matches a percentage of each employee’s contributions consistent with the provisions of the plan for which he/she is eligible. Total Company matching contributions to the plans were $ 235 million , $ 242 million and $ 214 million in 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. 66 12. Capital and Treasury Stock Changes in treasury stock were: Treasury Stock (Amounts in Millions Except Treasury Stock Shares in Thousands) Shares Amount Balance at January 1, 2017 413,332 $ 28,352 Employee compensation and stock option plans ( 25,508 ) ( 3,156 ) Repurchase of common stock 49,494 6,358 Balance at December 31, 2017 437,318 31,554 Employee compensation and stock option plans ( 22,082 ) ( 3,060 ) Repurchase of common stock 42,283 5,868 Balance at December 30, 2018 457,519 34,362 Employee compensation and stock option plans ( 20,053 ) ( 2,691 ) Repurchase of common stock 49,870 6,746 Balance at December 29, 2019 487,336 $ 38,417 Aggregate shares of common stock issued were approximately 3,119,843,000 shares at the end of 2019 , 2018 and 2017 . Cash dividends paid were $ 3.75 per share in 2019 , compared with dividends of $ 3.54 per share in 2018 , and $ 3.32 per share in 2017 . On December 17, 2018, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program, authorizing the Company to purchase up to $ 5.0 billion of the Company's shares of common stock. This share repurchase program was completed as of September 29, 2019. On October 13, 2015, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program, authorizing the Company to purchase up to $ 10.0 billion of the Company's shares of common stock. This share repurchase program was completed as of July 2, 2017. 13. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) Components of other comprehensive income (loss) consist of the following: (Dollars in Millions) Foreign Currency Translation Gain/(Loss) On Securities Employee Benefit Plans Gain/ (Loss) On Derivatives & Hedges Total Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) January 1, 2017 $ ( 9,047 ) 411 ( 5,980 ) ( 285 ) ( 14,901 ) Net 2017 changes 1,696 ( 179 ) ( 170 ) 355 1,702 December 31, 2017 ( 7,351 ) 232 ( 6,150 ) 70 ( 13,199 ) Cumulative adjustment to retained earnings — ( 232 ) (1) ( 232 ) Net 2018 changes ( 1,518 ) — ( 8 ) ( 265 ) ( 1,791 ) December 30, 2018 ( 8,869 ) — ( 6,158 ) ( 195 ) ( 15,222 ) Net 2019 changes 164 — ( 733 ) ( 100 ) ( 669 ) December 29, 2019 $ ( 8,705 ) — ( 6,891 ) ( 295 ) ( 15,891 ) (1) Per the adoption of ASU 2016-01- Financial Instruments Amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income are presented net of the related tax impact. Foreign currency translation is not adjusted for income taxes where it relates to permanent investments in international subsidiaries. For additional details on comprehensive income see the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Details on reclassifications out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income: Gain/(Loss) On Securities - reclassifications released to Other (income) expense, net. Employee Benefit Plans - reclassifications are included in net periodic benefit cost. See Note 10 for additional details. Gain/(Loss) On Derivatives & Hedges - reclassifications to earnings are recorded in the same account as the hedged transaction. See Note 6 for additional details. 67 14. International Currency Translation For translation of its subsidiaries operating in non-U.S. Dollar currencies, the Company has determined that the local currencies of its international subsidiaries are the functional currencies except those in highly inflationary economies, which are defined as those which have had compound cumulative rates of inflation of 100% or more during the past three years , or where a substantial portion of its cash flows are not in the local currency. For the majority of the Company's subsidiaries the local currency is the functional currency. In consolidating international subsidiaries, balance sheet currency effects are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. This equity account includes the results of translating certain balance sheet assets and liabilities at current exchange rates and some accounts at historical rates, except for those located in highly inflationary economies, (Argentina and Venezuela). The translation of balance sheet accounts for highly inflationary economies are reflected in the operating results. A rollforward of the changes during 2019 , 2018 and 2017 for foreign currency translation adjustments is included in Note 13. Net currency transaction gains and losses included in Other (income) expense were losses of $ 267 million , $ 265 million and $ 216 million in 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. 15. Earnings Per Share The following is a reconciliation of basic net earnings per share to diluted net earnings per share for the fiscal years ended December 29, 2019 , December 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 : (In Millions Except Per Share Amounts) 2019 2018 2017 Basic net earnings per share $ 5.72 5.70 0.48 Average shares outstanding — basic 2,645.1 2,681.5 2,692.0 Potential shares exercisable under stock option plans 136.3 139.0 139.7 Less: shares repurchased under treasury stock method ( 97.8 ) ( 92.5 ) ( 87.3 ) Convertible debt shares 0.7 0.7 0.9 Adjusted average shares outstanding — diluted 2,684.3 2,728.7 2,745.3 Diluted net earnings per share $ 5.63 5.61 0.47 The diluted net earnings per share calculation included the dilutive effect of convertible debt that is offset by the related reduction in interest expense of $ 1 million after-tax for 2019, 2018 and 2017. The diluted net earnings per share calculation for 2019 excluded an insignificant number of shares related to stock options, as the exercise price of these options was greater than the average market value of the Company’s stock. The diluted net earnings per share calculation for 2018 and 2017 included all shares related to stock options, as the exercise price of all options was less than the average market value of the Company's stock. 16. Lease Commitments The Company primarily has operating leases for space, vehicles, manufacturing equipment and data processing equipment. Leases have remaining lease terms ranging from 1 year to 55 years , some of which could include options to extend the leases when they are reasonably certain. The operating lease costs were approximately $ 307 million , $ 332 million and $ 372 million in 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities in 2019 were $ 308 million . Commitments under finance leases are not significant. Other supplemental information related to these leases are as follows: The Weighted Average Remaining Lease Term and discount rate: Operating leases 5.8 years Weighted Average Discount Rate 3 % 68 Maturity of Lease Liabilities related to Operating Lease The approximate minimum rental payments required under operating leases that have initial or remaining non-cancelable lease terms in excess of one year at December 29, 2019 are: (Dollars in Millions) Operating Leases 2020 $ 215 2021 254 2022 197 2023 141 2024 86 After 2024 201 Total lease payments 1,094 Less: Interest 109 Present Value of lease liabilities $ 985 Supplemental information for comparative periods: As of December 30, 2018, prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-02, the approximate future minimum rental payments required under operating leases that have initial or remaining non-cancelable lease terms in excess of one year were: (Dollars in Millions) 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 After 2023 Total $ 223 188 154 116 76 139 896 Supplemental balance sheet information related to leases as of December 29, 2019 were as follows : (Dollars in Millions) Non-current operating lease right-of-use assets $ 957 Current operating lease liabilities 269 Non-current Operating lease liabilities 716 Total operating lease liabilities $ 985 17. Common Stock, Stock Option Plans and Stock Compensation Agreements At December 29, 2019 , the Company had 2 stock-based compensation plans. The shares outstanding are for contracts under the Company's 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan and the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan. The 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan expired April 26, 2012. All options and restricted shares granted subsequent to that date were under the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan. Under the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan, the Company may issue up to 650 million shares of common stock, plus any shares canceled, expired, forfeited, or not issued from the 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan subsequent to April 26, 2012. Shares available for future grants under the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan were 315 million at the end of 2019 . The compensation cost that has been charged against income for these plans was $ 977 million , $ 978 million and $ 962 million for 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The total income tax benefit recognized in the income statement for share-based compensation costs was $ 227 million , $ 192 million and $ 275 million for 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The total unrecognized compensation cost was $ 823 million , $ 827 million and $ 798 million for 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The weighted average period for this cost to be recognized was 1.71 years, 1.73 years and 1.76 years for 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 , respectively. Share-based compensation costs capitalized as part of inventory were insignificant in all periods. The Company settles employee benefit equity issuances with treasury shares. Treasury shares are replenished throughout the year for the number of shares used to settle employee benefit equity issuances. 69 Stock Options Stock options expire 10 years from the date of grant and vest over service periods that range from 6 months to 4 years . All options are granted at the average of the high and low prices of the Company’s Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of grant. The fair value of each option award was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model that uses the assumptions noted in the following table. For 2019, 2018 and 2017 grants, expected volatility represents a blended rate of 10-year weekly historical overall volatility rate, and a 5-week average implied volatility rate based on at-the-money traded Johnson & Johnson options with a life of 2 years. For all grants, historical data is used to determine the expected life of the option. The risk-free rate was based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

Restricted Share Units and Performance Share Units The Company grants restricted share units which vest over service periods that range from 6 months to 3 years . The Company also grants performance share units, which are paid in shares of Johnson & Johnson Common Stock after the end of a three -year performance period. Whether any performance share units vest, and the amount that does vest, is tied to the completion of service periods that range from 6 months to 3 years and the achievement, over a three -year period, of three equally-weighted goals that directly align with or help drive long-term total shareholder return: operational sales, adjusted operational earnings per share, and relative total shareholder return. The number of shares actually earned at the end of the three -year period will vary, based only on actual performance, from 0 % to 200 % of the target number of performance share units granted . In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company modified the restricted share units that were scheduled to vest between January 1, 2018 and March 15, 2018. This modification guaranteed a minimum aggregate value, below the market value of the total expected payout amount, for all awards expected to vest during this period. The amount that was committed was not material to the Company’s overall financial position. A summary of the restricted share units and performance share units activity under the Plans as of December 29, 2019 is presented below: (Shares in Thousands) Outstanding Restricted Share Units Outstanding Performance Share Units Shares at December 30, 2018 18,460 2,494 Granted 5,769 932 Issued ( 6,261 ) ( 996 ) Canceled/forfeited/adjusted ( 1,199 ) ( 256 ) Shares at December 29, 2019 16,769 2,174 The average fair value of the restricted share units granted was $ 121.31 , $ 119.67 and $ 107.69 in 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively, using the fair market value at the date of grant. The fair value of restricted share units was discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the restricted share units during the vesting period. The fair value of restricted share units issued was $ 585.9 million , $ 613.7 million and $ 596.5 million in 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The weighted average fair value of the performance share units granted was $ 124.67 , $ 120.64 and $ 114.13 in 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , calculated using the weighted average fair market value for each of the three component goals at the date of grant. The fair values for the sales and earnings per share goals of each performance share unit were estimated on the date of grant using the fair market value of the shares at the time of the award discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the performance share units during the vesting period. The fair value for the relative total shareholder return goal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo valuation model. The fair value of performance share units issued was $ 119.1 million , $ 128.8 million and $ 132.5 million in 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. 71 18.

Acquisitions and Divestitures Certain businesses were acquired for $ 5.8 billion in cash and $ 1.4 billion of liabilities assumed during 2019. These acquisitions were accounted for using the acquisition method and, accordingly, results of operations have been included in the financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition. The 2019 acquisitions primarily included: DR. CI:LABO, a Japanese company focused on the marketing, development and distribution of a broad range of dermocosmetic, cosmetic and skincare products; Auris Health, Inc. a privately held developer of robotic technologies, initially focused in lung cancer, with an FDA-cleared platform currently used in bronchoscopic diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and Taris Biomedical LLC a company specializing in the development of a novel drug delivery technology for the treatment of bladder diseases including cancer. The Company also acquired the assets of JointPoint, Inc., a privately held company, with navigation software to improve surgical outcomes in hip replacement. The excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired amounted to $ 6.8 billion and has been assigned to identifiable intangible assets, with any residual recorded to goodwill. On January 17, 2019, the Company acquired DR. CI:LABO, a Japanese company focused on the marketing, development and distribution of a broad range of dermocosmetic, cosmetic and skincare products for a total purchase price of approximately ¥ 230 billion , which equates to approximately $ 2.1 billion , using the exchange rate of 109.06 Japanese Yen to each U.S. Dollar on January 16, 2019. The acquisition was completed through a series of transactions that included an all-cash tender offer to acquire the publicly held shares not already held by the Company for ¥ 5,900 per share. The Company previously held a 20 % ownership in DR. CI:LABO. As of June 2019, the Company became the legal owner of DR. CI:LABO with the completion of the tender offer procedure in Japan. The acquired company was then delisted from the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Additionally, in the fiscal first quarter of 2019, the Company recognized a pre-tax gain recorded in Other (income) expense, net, of approximately $ 0.3 billion related to the Company's previously held equity investment in DR. CI:LABO. The Company treated this transaction as a business combination and included it in the Consumer segment. The allocation of the purchase price included in the current period balance sheet is based on the best estimate of management and is preliminary and subject to change. At December 29, 2019, the fair value of the acquisition was allocated primarily to amortizable intangible assets for $ 1.5 billion , goodwill for $ 1.2 billion and liabilities of $ 0.4 billion subject to any subsequent valuation adjustments within the measurement period. The adjustments made since the date of acquisition were $ 0.1 billion to intangible assets, accrued liabilities, deferred taxes on income and property, plant and equipment with the offset to goodwill. The amortizable intangible assets were comprised of brand/trademarks and customer relationships with a weighted average life of 15.3 years The goodwill is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise from the business acquisition and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. On April 1, 2019 the Company completed the acquisition of Auris Health, Inc. for approximately $ 3.4 billion , net of cash acquired. Additional contingent payments of up to $ 2.35 billion , in the aggregate, may be payable upon reaching certain predetermined milestones. Auris Health was a privately held developer of robotic technologies, initially focused in lung cancer, with an FDA-cleared platform currently used in bronchoscopic diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. The Company treated this transaction as a business combination and included it in the Medical Devices segment. The fair value of the acquisition was allocated primarily to amortizable and non-amortizable intangible assets, primarily IPR&D for $ 3.0 billion , goodwill for $ 2.0 billion , marketable securities of $ 0.2 billion and liabilities assumed of $ 1.8 billion , which includes the fair value of the contingent payments mentioned above, subject to any subsequent valuation adjustments within the measurement period. As of December 29, 2019 there were no valuation adjustments. The fair value of the contingent consideration was $ 1.1 billion . A probability of success factor ranging from 55 % to 95 % was used in the fair value calculation to reflect inherent regulatory and commercial risk of the contingent payments and IPR&D. The discount rate applied was approximately 10 % . The goodwill is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise from the business acquisition and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. On December 20, 2019, the Company announced the agreement to acquire Verily's stake in Verb Surgical Inc. The transaction closed in the fiscal first quarter of 2020 and Verb Surgical Inc. is now a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson. On December 30, 2019, subsequent to the fiscal year end, the Company completed the acquisition of all rights to the investigational compound bermekimab, which has multiple dermatological indications, along with certain employees from XBiotech Inc., for a purchase price of $ 0.8 billion . XBiotech may be eligible to receive additional payments upon the receipt of certain commercialization authorizations. The transaction will be accounted for as a business combination and included in the Pharmaceutical segment. During 2018 certain businesses were acquired for $ 0.9 billion in cash and $ 0.1 billion of liabilities assumed during 2018. These acquisitions were accounted for using the acquisition method and, accordingly, results of operations have been included in the financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition. The 2018 acquisitions primarily included: Zarbee’s, Inc., a privately held company that is a leader in naturally-based consumer healthcare products; BeneVir Biopharm, Inc. (BeneVir), a privately-held, biopharmaceutical company specializing in the development of oncolytic immunotherapies and Orthotaxy, a privately-held developer of software-enabled surgery technologies, including a differentiated robotic-assisted surgery solution. The Company also acquired the assets of Medical Enterprises Distribution LLC, a privately held healthcare technology firm focused on surgical procedure innovation. 80 The excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired amounted to $ 1.0 billion and has been assigned to identifiable intangible assets, with any residual recorded to goodwill. During 2017 certain businesses were acquired for $ 35.2 billion in cash and $ 1.8 billion of liabilities assumed. These acquisitions were accounted for using the acquisition method and, accordingly, results of operations have been included in the financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition. The 2017 acquisitions primarily included: Actelion Ltd, an established leading franchise of differentiated, innovative products for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH); Abbott Medical Optics (AMO), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Abbott Laboratories, which included ophthalmic products related to: cataract surgery, laser refractive surgery and consumer eye health; Neuravi Limited, a privately-held medical device company that develops and markets medical devices for neurointerventional therapy; TearScience Inc., a manufacturer of products dedicated to treating meibomian gland dysfunction; Sightbox, Inc., a privately-held company that developed a subscription vision care service that connects consumers with eye care professionals and a supply of contact lenses; Torax Medical, Inc., a privately-held medical device company that manufactures and markets the LINX™ Reflux Management System for the surgical treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease and Megadyne Medical Products, Inc., a privately-held medical device company that develops, manufactures and markets electrosurgical tools. The excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired amounted to $ 34.4 billion and has been assigned to identifiable intangible assets, with any residual recorded to goodwill. Of this amount, approximately $ 1.1 billion has been identified as the value of IPR&D, primarily associated with the acquisition of Actelion Ltd. The value of the IPR&D was calculated using cash flow projections discounted for the inherent risk in the projects. During 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of Actelion Ltd through an all cash tender offer in Switzerland for $ 280 per share, amounting to $ 29.6 billion , net of cash acquired. As part of the transaction, immediately prior to the completion of the acquisition, Actelion spun out its drug discovery operations and early-stage clinical development assets into a newly created Swiss biopharmaceutical company, Idorsia Ltd. The shares of Idorsia are listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange (SIX). In 2017 the Company held 9.9 % of the shares of Idorsia and had rights to an additional 22.1 % of Idorsia equity through a convertible loan with a principal amount of approximately $ 0.5 billion . As a result of Idorsia raising additional capital in July 2018, the Company currently holds 9.0 % of the shares of Idorsia and has rights to an additional 20.8 % of Idorsia equity through a convertible loan with a carrying value and a principal amount of approximately $ 0.5 billion . The convertible loan may be converted into 38,715,114 Idorsia shares, subject to certain restrictions, as follows: (i) up to an aggregate shareholding of 16 % of Idorsia shares as a result of certain shareholders holding more than 20 % of the issued Idorsia shares, and (ii) up to the balance of the remaining amount within 20 business days of the maturity date of the convertible loan, which has a 10 year term, or if Idorsia undergoes a change of control transaction. At the maturity of the loan, if the remaining amount has not yet been converted, Idorsia may elect to settle the remaining amount in cash or in ordinary shares of Idorsia. The equity investment in Idorsia and the convertible loan are recorded in Other assets in the Company's consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company also exercised the option acquired on ACT-132577, a product within Idorsia being developed for resistant hypertension currently in phase 3 of clinical development. The Company has also entered into an agreement to provide Idorsia with a Swiss franc denominated credit facility of approximately $ 250 million . As of December 29, 2019, Idorsia has not made any draw-downs under the credit facility. Actelion has established a leading franchise of differentiated, innovative products for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) that are highly complementary to the existing portfolio of the Company. The addition of Actelion’s specialty in-market medicines and late-stage products is consistent with the Company's efforts to grow in attractive and complementary therapeutic areas and serve patients with serious illnesses and significant unmet medical need. 81 During the fiscal second quarter of 2018, the Company finalized the purchase price allocation for Actelion to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed using the acquisition method. The following table presents the amounts recognized for assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date with adjustments made through the second quarter of 2018: (Dollars in Millions) Cash & Cash equivalents 469 Inventory (1) 759 Accounts Receivable 485 Other current assets 93 Property, plant and equipment 104 Goodwill 6,161 Intangible assets 25,010 Deferred Taxes 99 Other non-current assets 19 Total Assets Acquired 33,199 Current liabilities 956 Deferred Taxes 1,776 Other non-current liabilities 413 Total Liabilities Assumed 3,145 Net Assets Acquired 30,054 (1) Includes adjustment of $ 642 million to write-up the acquired inventory to its estimated fair value. The adjustments made since the date of acquisition were $ 0.2 billion to the deferred taxes and $ 0.4 billion to the current liabilities with the offset to goodwill. The assets acquired are recorded in the Pharmaceutical segment. The acquisition of Actelion resulted in approximately $ 6.2 billion of goodwill. The goodwill is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise from the acquisition. The goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The purchase price allocation to the identifiable intangible assets is as follows: (Dollars in Millions) Intangible assets with definite lives: Patents and trademarks* $ 24,230 Total amortizable intangibles 24,230 In-process research and development 780 Total intangible assets $ 25,010 *Includes $ 0.4 billion related to VALCHLOR ® , one of the acquired products, which was divested in the fiscal second quarter of 2018. The patents and trademarks acquired are comprised of developed technology with a weighted average life of 9 years and was primarily based on the patent life of the marketed products. The intangible assets with definite lives were assigned asset lives ranging from 4 to 10 years . The in-process research and development intangible assets were valued for technology programs for unapproved products. The value of the IPR&D was calculated using probability adjusted cash flow projections discounted for the risk inherent in such projects. The discount rate applied was 9 % . The acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method and, accordingly, the results of operations of Actelion were reported in the Company's financial statements beginning on June 16, 2017, the date of acquisition. For the year ended December 31, 2017, total sales and a net loss for Actelion from the date of acquisition were $ 1.4 billion and $ 1.4 billion , respectively. The following table provides pro forma results of operations for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, as if Actelion had been acquired as of January 4, 2016. The pro forma results include the effect of certain purchase accounting adjustments such as the estimated changes in depreciation and amortization expense on the acquired tangible and intangible assets. However, pro forma results do not include any anticipated cost savings or other effects of the planned integration of Actelion. 82 Accordingly, such amounts are not necessarily indicative of the results if the acquisition had occurred on the dates indicated or which may occur in the future. Unaudited Pro forma Consolidated Results (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Data) 2017 Net Sales 77,681 Net Earnings 1,509 Diluted Net Earnings per Common Share 0.55 The Company recorded Actelion acquisition related costs before tax of approximately $ 0.2 billion , $ 0.2 billion and $ 0.8 billion in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, which was recorded in Other (income)/expense and Cost of products sold. During 2017, the Company acquired Abbott Medical Optics (AMO), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Abbott Laboratories, for $ 4.3 billion , net of cash acquired. The acquisition included ophthalmic products related to: cataract surgery, laser refractive surgery and consumer eye health. The net purchase price was primarily recorded as amortizable intangible assets for $ 2.3 billion and goodwill for $ 1.7 billion . The weighted average life of total amortizable intangibles, the majority being customer relationships, is approximately 14.4 years . The goodwill is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise from the business acquisition and is not deductible for tax purposes. The intangible assets and goodwill amounts are based on the final purchase price allocation. The assets acquired were recorded in the Medical Devices segment. In 2012, the Company completed the acquisition of Synthes, Inc. for a purchase price of $ 20.2 billion in cash and stock. In connection with the acquisition of Synthes, Inc. the Company entered into two accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreements. In 2013, the Company settled the remaining liabilities under the ASR agreements. While the Company believes that the transactions under each ASR agreement and a series of related internal transactions were consummated in a tax efficient manner in accordance with applicable law, it is possible that the Internal Revenue Service could assert one or more contrary positions to challenge the transactions from a tax perspective. If challenged, an amount up to the total purchase price for the Synthes shares could be treated as subject to applicable U.S. tax at approximately the statutory rate to the Company, plus interest. With the exception of the Actelion Ltd acquisition, supplemental pro forma information for 2019, 2018 and 2017 in accordance with U.S. GAAP standards related to business combinations, and goodwill and other intangible assets, is not provided, as the impact of the aforementioned acquisitions did not have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position. Divestitures During 2019, the Company divested its Advanced Sterilization Products (ASP) business to Fortive Corporation for an aggregate value of approximately $ 2.8 billion , consisting of $ 2.7 billion of cash proceeds and $ 0.1 billion of retained net receivables. As of December 30, 2018, the assets held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheet were $ 0.2 billion of inventory, $ 0.1 billion of property, plant and equipment, net and $ 0.3 billion of goodwill. The Company recognized a pre-tax gain recorded in Other (income) expense, net, of approximately $ 2.0 billion . During 2018, the Company divested the LifeScan Inc business for approximately $ 2.1 billion and retained certain net liabilities. Other divestitures in 2018 included: NIZORAL ® , RoC ® and certain non-strategic Pharmaceutical products. In 2018, the pre-tax gains on the divestitures were approximately $ 1.2 billion . In 2018, the Company accepted a binding offer to form a strategic collaboration with Jabil Inc., one of the world’s leading manufacturing services providers for health care products and technology products. The Company is expanding a 12-year relationship with Jabil to produce a range of products within the Ethicon Endo-Surgery and DePuy Synthes businesses. This transaction includes the transfer of employees and manufacturing sites. The majority of the transfers were completed in 2019 with a minor amount remaining in 2020. As of December 29, 2019, the assets held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheet were $ 0.1 billion of inventory and property, plant and equipment, net. As of December 30, 2018, the assets held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheet were $ 0.3 billion of inventory and $ 0.1 billion of property, plant and equipment, net. For additional details on the global supply chain restructuring see Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. During 2017, the Company divestitures primarily included: the Codman Neurosurgery business, to Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation and the divestiture of COMPEED ® to HRA Pharma. In 2017, the pre-tax gains on the divestitures were approximately $ 1.3 billion . 83 21. Legal Proceedings Johnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial, supplier indemnification and other matters; governmental investigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of their business. The Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of December 29, 2019 , the Company has determined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal issue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance with ASC 450-20-25. For these and other litigation and regulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts already accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors including, among other things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and unpredictability of the number of potential claims; or there are numerous parties involved. To the extent adverse verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated. In the Company's opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with counsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company's balance sheet, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position. However, the resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and cash flows for that period. PRODUCT LIABILITY Johnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in numerous product liability claims and lawsuits involving multiple products. Claimants in these cases seek substantial compensatory and, where available, punitive damages. While the Company believes it has substantial defenses, it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation. From time to time, even if it has substantial defenses, the Company considers isolated settlements based on a variety of circumstances. The Company has established accruals for product liability claims and lawsuits in compliance with ASC 450-20 based on currently available information, which in some cases may be limited. The Company accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to defend each matter when those costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. For certain of these matters, the Company has accrued additional amounts such as estimated costs associated with settlements, damages and other losses. Product liability accruals can represent projected product liability for thousands of claims around the world, each in different litigation environments and with different fact patterns. Changes to the accruals may be required in the future as additional information becomes available. The most significant of these cases include: the DePuy ASR™ XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR™ Hip Resurfacing System; the PINNACLE ® Acetabular Cup System; pelvic meshes; RISPERDAL ® ; XARELTO ® ; body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSONS ® Baby Powder; INVOKANA ® ; and ETHICON PHYSIOMESH ® Flexible Composite Mesh. As of December 29, 2019 , in the United States there were approximately 1,100 plaintiffs with direct claims in pending lawsuits regarding injuries allegedly due to the DePuy ASR™ XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR™ Hip Resurfacing System; 10,300 with respect to the PINNACLE ® Acetabular Cup System; 17,600 with respect to pelvic meshes; 11,900 with respect to RISPERDAL ® ; 29,000 with respect to XARELTO ® ; 17,900 with respect to body powders containing talc; 400 with respect to INVOKANA ® ; and 3,300 with respect to ETHICON PHYSIOMESH ® Flexible Composite Mesh. In August 2010, DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. (DePuy) announced a worldwide voluntary recall of its ASR ™ XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR ™ Hip Resurfacing System used in hip replacement surgery. Claims for personal injury have been made against DePuy and Johnson & Johnson. The number of pending lawsuits is expected to fluctuate as certain lawsuits are settled or dismissed and additional lawsuits are filed. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. Litigation has also been filed in countries outside of the United States, primarily in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Ireland, Germany, India and Italy. In November 2013, DePuy reached an agreement with a Court-appointed committee of lawyers representing ASR Hip System plaintiffs to establish a program to settle claims with eligible ASR Hip patients in the United States who had surgery to replace their ASR Hips, known as revision surgery, as of August 31, 2013. DePuy reached additional agreements in February 2015 and March 2017, which further extended the settlement program to include ASR Hip patients who had revision surgeries after 84 August 31, 2013 and prior to February 15, 2017. This settlement program has resolved more than 10,000 claims, therefore bringing to resolution significant ASR Hip litigation activity in the United States. However, lawsuits in the United States remain, and the settlement program does not address litigation outside of the United States. In Australia, a class action settlement was reached that resolved the claims of the majority of ASR Hip patients in that country. In Canada, the Company has reached agreements to settle two pending class actions which have been approved by the Québec Superior Court and the Supreme Court of British Columbia. The Company continues to receive information with respect to potential additional costs associated with this recall on a worldwide basis. The Company has established accruals for the costs associated with the United States settlement program and DePuy ASR ™ Hip-related product liability litigation. Claims for personal injury have also been made against DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. and Johnson & Johnson (collectively, DePuy) relating to the PINNACLE ® Acetabular Cup System used in hip replacement surgery. Product liability lawsuits continue to be filed, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas. Litigation has also been filed in some state courts and in countries outside of the United States. Several adverse verdicts have been rendered against DePuy, one of which was reversed on appeal and remanded for retrial. During the first quarter of 2019, DePuy established a United States settlement program to resolve these cases. As part of the settlement program, adverse verdicts have been settled. The Company has established an accrual for product liability litigation associated with the PINNACLE ® Acetabular Cup System and the related settlement program. Claims for personal injury have been made against Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon) and Johnson & Johnson arising out of Ethicon's pelvic mesh devices used to treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. The Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and additional cases. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States had been organized as a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia. The MDL Court is remanding cases for trial to the jurisdictions where the case was originally filed and additional pelvic mesh lawsuits have been filed, and remain, outside of the MDL. The Company has settled or otherwise resolved a majority of the United States cases and the estimated costs associated with these settlements and the remaining cases are reflected in the Company's accruals. In addition, class actions and individual personal injury cases or claims have been commenced in various countries outside of the United States, including claims and cases in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Belgium, and class actions in Israel, Australia and Canada, seeking damages for alleged injury resulting from Ethicon's pelvic mesh devices. In November 2019, the Federal Court of Australia issued a judgment regarding its findings with respect to liability in relation to the three Lead Applicants and generally in relation to the design, manufacture, pre and post-market assessments and testing, and supply and promotion of the devices in Australia used to treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. Orders determining the damages amounts to be awarded to the three Lead Applicants are expected in the first quarter of 2020. With respect to other group members, there will be an individual case assessment process which will require proof of use and causally related loss. The class actions in Canada are expected to be discontinued in 2020 as a result of a settlement of a group of cases, subject to court approval of the discontinuance. The Company has established accruals with respect to product liability litigation associated with Ethicon's pelvic mesh products. Following a June 2016 worldwide market withdrawal of ETHICON PHYSIOMESH ® Flexible Composite Mesh, claims for personal injury have been made against Ethicon, Inc. and Johnson & Johnson alleging personal injury arising out of the use of this hernia mesh device. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. A multi-county litigation (MCL) has also been formed in New Jersey state court and assigned to Atlantic County for cases pending in New Jersey. In addition to the matters in the MDL and MCL, there are additional lawsuits pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, which are part of the MDL for polypropylene mesh devices manufactured by C.R. Bard, Inc., and lawsuits pending outside the United States. Along with ETHICON PHYSIOMESH ® lawsuits, there were a number of filings related to the PROCEED ® Mesh and PROCEED ® Ventral Patch products. In March 2019, the New Jersey Supreme Court entered an order consolidating all PROCEED ® and PROCEED ® Ventral Patch cases as an MCL in Atlantic County Superior Court. Additional cases have been filed in various federal and state courts in the US, and in jurisdictions outside the US. The Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. The Company has established accruals with respect to product liability litigation associated with ETHICON PHYSIOMESH ® Flexible Composite Mesh, PROCEED ® Mesh and PROCEED ® Ventral Patch products. In September 2019, plaintiffs’ attorney filed an application with the New Jersey Supreme Court seeking centralized management of 107 PROLENE™ Polypropylene Hernia System cases. The New Jersey Supreme Court granted plaintiffs application in January 2020 and those will be transferred to an MCL in Atlantic County Superior Court. 85 Claims for personal injury have been made against Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Johnson & Johnson arising out of the use of RISPERDAL ® , indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia, acute manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder and irritability associated with autism, and related compounds. Lawsuits have been primarily filed in state courts in Pennsylvania, California, and Missouri. Other actions are pending in various courts in the United States and Canada. Product liability lawsuits continue to be filed, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. The Company has successfully defended a number of these cases but there have been verdicts against the Company, including a recent verdict in October 2019 of $ 8 billion of punitive damages related to one single plaintiff which was subsequently reduced in January 2020 to $6.8 million by the trial judge. The Company will appeal the final judgment. The Company has settled or otherwise resolved many of the United States cases and the costs associated with these settlements are reflected in the Company's accruals. Claims for personal injury arising out of the use of XARELTO ® , an oral anticoagulant, have been made against Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI); Johnson & Johnson (J&J); and JPI's collaboration partner for XARELTO ® Bayer AG and certain of its affiliates. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. In addition, cases have been filed in state courts across the United States. Many of these cases have been consolidated into a state mass tort litigation in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and in a coordinated proceeding in Los Angeles, California. Class action lawsuits also have been filed in Canada. In March 2019, JPI and J&J announced an agreement in principle to the settle the XARELTO ® cases in the United States; the settlement agreement was executed in May 2019, and the settlement became final in December 2019. This will resolve the majority of cases pending in the United States. The Company has established accruals for its costs associated with the United States settlement program and XARELTO ® related product liability litigation. Personal injury claims alleging that talc causes cancer have been made against Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. and Johnson & Johnson arising out of the use of body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S ® Baby Powder. The number of pending product liability lawsuits continues to increase, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. Lawsuits have been primarily filed in state courts in Missouri, New Jersey and California, as well as outside the United States. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. In the multi-district litigation, the parties have moved to exclude experts, known as Daubert motions. The Court held Daubert hearings in mid-July 2019 and a final round of briefing has been submitted to the Court. The parties are awaiting a decision. The Company has successfully defended a number of these cases but there have been verdicts against the Company, including a verdict in July 2018 of $ 4.7 billion . The Company believes that it has strong grounds on appeal to overturn these verdicts. The Company has established an accrual primarily for defense costs in connection with product liability litigation associated with body powders containing talc. In February 2019, the Company’s talc supplier, Imerys Talc America, Inc. and two of its affiliates, Imerys Talc Vermont, Inc. and Imerys Talc Canada, Inc. (collectively, Imerys) filed a voluntary chapter 11 petition commencing a reorganization under the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (Imerys Bankruptcy). The Imerys Bankruptcy relates to Imerys’ potential liability for personal injury from exposure to talcum powder sold by Imerys (Talc Claims). In its bankruptcy filing, Imerys noted certain claims it alleges it has against the Company for indemnification and rights to joint insurance proceeds. Based on such claims as well as indemnity and insurance claims the Company has against Imerys, the Company petitioned the United States District Court for the District of Delaware to establish federal jurisdiction of the state court talc lawsuits under the Bankruptcy Code. The Company's petition was denied and the state court talc lawsuits that have been removed to federal court on such basis have been remanded. The Company formally proposed to resolve Imerys' and the Company’s obligations arising out of the Talc Claims by agreeing to assume the defense of litigation of all Talc Claims involving the Company's products, lifting the automatic stay to enable the Talc Claims to proceed outside the bankruptcy forum with the Company agreeing to settle or pay any judgment against Imerys, and waiving the Company’s indemnification claims against Imerys. Discussions between Imerys and the Company on this issue remain ongoing. In February 2018, a securities class action lawsuit was filed against Johnson & Johnson and certain named officers in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging that Johnson & Johnson violated the federal securities laws by failing to adequately disclose the alleged asbestos contamination in body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON'S ® Baby Powder, and that purchasers of Johnson & Johnson’s shares suffered losses as a result. Plaintiffs are seeking damages. In April 2019, the Company moved to dismiss the complaint and briefing on the motion was complete as of August 2019. In December 2019, the Court denied, in part, the motion to dismiss. In October 2018, a shareholder derivative lawsuit was filed against Johnson & Johnson as the nominal defendant and its current directors as defendants in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging a breach of fiduciary duties related to the alleged asbestos contamination in body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S ® Baby Powder, and that Johnson & Johnson has suffered damages as a result of those alleged breaches. In June 2019, the shareholder filed an additional 86 complaint initiating a summary proceeding in New Jersey state court for a books and records inspection. In August 2019, Johnson & Johnson responded to the books and records complaint and filed a cross motion to dismiss. In September 2019, Plaintiff replied and the Court heard oral argument. The Court has not yet ruled in the books and records action. In September 2019, the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey granted defendants’ motion to dismiss the shareholder derivative lawsuit, and dismissed the complaint without prejudice. In October 2019, the shareholder filed a notice of appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. In January 2020, the shareholder voluntarily dismissed his appeal, with prejudice. Four additional shareholder derivative lawsuits have been filed in New Jersey making similar allegations against the Company and its current directors and certain officers. In January 2019, two ERISA class action lawsuits were filed by participants in the Johnson & Johnson Savings Plan against Johnson & Johnson, its Pension and Benefits Committee, and certain named officers in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by offering Johnson & Johnson stock as a Johnson & Johnson Savings Plan investment option when it was imprudent to do so because of failures to disclose alleged asbestos contamination in body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S ® Baby Powder. Plaintiffs are seeking damages and injunctive relief. Defendants have filed a motion to dismiss. A lawsuit is pending in the United States District Court for the Central District of California alleging violations of Proposition 65, California’s Unfair Competition Law and False Advertising Law concerning JOHNSON’S ® Baby Powder. In June 2019, plaintiffs filed a motion for voluntary dismissal of this Proposition 65 action and the Company opposed such motion to the extent it would allow plaintiffs’ counsel to refile such claims with new plaintiffs. The Court granted plaintiff’s motion conditioned upon payment of attorneys’ fees and costs. The Court entered its award of attorneys’ fees and costs in October 2019 and the case was dismissed without prejudice. Another lawsuit alleging violations of Proposition 65, California’s Consumer Legal Remedies Act relating to JOHNSON’S ® Baby Powder was filed in the Superior Court of California for the County of San Diego. In July 2019, the Company filed a notice of removal to the United States District Court for the Southern District of California and plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint shortly thereafter. In October 2019, the Company moved to dismiss the second amended complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, primarily on the basis that the plaintiffs failed to comply with Proposition 65’s mandatory pre-suit notice requirement, which applies even when a plaintiff asserts only an indirect Proposition 65 claim. In response to those motions, plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint. In December 2019, the Company moved to dismiss the third amended complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. In addition, the Company has received preliminary inquiries and subpoenas to produce documents regarding these matters from Senator Murray, a member of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, the Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. Congressional Subcommittee on Economic and Consumer Policy. The Company is cooperating with government inquiries and continues to produce documents in response. Claims for personal injury have been made against a number of Johnson & Johnson companies, including Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Johnson & Johnson, arising out of the use of INVOKANA ® , a prescription medication indicated to improve glycemic control in adults with Type 2 diabetes. Lawsuits filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. Cases have also been filed in state courts. Class action lawsuits have been filed in Canada. Product liability lawsuits continue to be filed, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. The Company has settled or otherwise resolved many of the cases and claims in the United States and the costs associated with these settlements are reflected in the Company's accruals. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY Certain subsidiaries of Johnson & Johnson are subject, from time to time, to legal proceedings and claims related to patent, trademark and other intellectual property matters arising out of their businesses. Many of these matters involve challenges to the coverage and/or validity of the patents on various products and allegations that certain of the Company’s products infringe the patents of third parties. Although these subsidiaries believe that they have substantial defenses to these challenges and allegations with respect to all significant patents, there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these matters. A loss in any of these cases could adversely affect the ability of these subsidiaries to sell their products, result in loss of sales due to loss of market exclusivity, require the payment of past damages and future royalties, and may result in a non-cash impairment charge for any associated intangible asset. The most significant of these matters are described below. 87 Medical Devices In March 2013, Medinol Ltd. (Medinol) filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Cordis Corporation (Cordis) and Johnson & Johnson in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that Cordis’s sales of the CYPHER ™ and CYPHER SELECT ™ stents made in the United States since 2005 willfully infringed four of Medinol's patents directed to the geometry of articulated stents. Although Johnson & Johnson has since sold Cordis, it has retained liability for this case. After the trial in January 2014, the district court dismissed the case, finding Medinol unreasonably delayed bringing its claims (the laches defense). In September 2014, the district court denied a motion by Medinol to vacate the judgment and grant it a new trial. Medinol appealed the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In March 2017, the United States Supreme Court held that the laches defense is not available in patent cases. In April 2018, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit remanded the case back to the district court to reconsider Medinol’s motion for a new trial. In March 2019, the district court denied Medinol’s motion for a new trial. In April 2019, Medinol filed a notice of appeal. In November 2016, MedIdea, L.L.C. (MedIdea) filed a patent infringement lawsuit against DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois alleging infringement by the ATTUNE ® Knee System. In April 2017, MedIdea filed an amended complaint adding DePuy Synthes Products, Inc. and DePuy Synthes Sales, Inc. as named defendants (collectively, DePuy). MedIdea alleges infringement of United States Patent Nos. 6,558,426 (’426); 8,273,132 (’132); 8,721,730 (’730) and 9,492,280 (’280) relating to posterior stabilized knee systems. Specifically, MedIdea alleges that the SOFCAM TM Contact feature of the ATTUNE ® posterior stabilized knee products infringes the patents-in-suit. MedIdea is seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief. In June 2017, the case was transferred to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. A claim construction hearing was held in October 2018, and a claim construction order was issued in November 2018. In December 2018, MedIdea stipulated to non-infringement of the ’132, ’730 and ’280 patents, based on the district court’s claim construction and reserving its right to appeal that construction, leaving only the ’426 patent at issue before the district court. In January 2019, the district court stayed the case pending a decision in the Inter Partes Review proceeding on the ’426 patent (see below). In December 2017, DePuy Synthes Products, Inc. filed a petition for Inter Partes Review with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), seeking to invalidate the two claims of the ’426 patent asserted in the district court litigation, and in June 2018, the USPTO instituted review of those claims. A hearing was held in March 2019, an d in April 2019, the USPTO issued its decision upholding the validity of the patent. In May 2019, DePuy filed a motion for summary judgment of non-infringement of the claims of the ’426 patent. In November 2019, judgment was entered in favor of Depuy. In December 2019, MedIdea filed a notice of appeal. In December 2016, Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc. and Ethicon Endo-Surgery, LLC (now known as Ethicon LLC) sued Covidien, Inc. in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts seeking a declaration that United States Patent Nos. 6,585,735 (the ’735 patent); 7,118,587; 7,473,253; 8,070,748 and 8,241,284 (the ’284 patent), are either invalid or not infringed by Ethicon’s ENSEAL ® X1 Large Jaw Tissue Sealer product. In April 2017, Covidien LP, Covidien Sales LLC, and Covidien AG (collectively, Covidien) answered and counterclaimed, denying the allegations, asserting willful infringement of the ’735 patent, the ’284 patent and United States Patent Nos. 8,323,310 (the ’310 patent); 9,084,608; 9,241,759 (the ’759 patent) and 9,113,882, and seeking damages and an injunction. Covidien filed a motion for preliminary injunction, which was denied in October 2017. The parties have entered joint stipulations such that only the ’310 patent and the ’759 patent remain in dispute. Trial began in September 2019, and closing arguments will be heard in March 2020. In December 2016, Dr. Ford Albritton sued Acclarent, Inc. (Acclarent) in United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas alleging that Acclarent’s RELIEVA ® Spin and RELIEVEA SpinPlus ® products infringe U.S. Patent No. 9,011,412 (the ’412 patent). Dr. Albritton also alleges breach of contract, fraud and that he is the true owner of Acclarent’s U.S. Patent No. 8,414,473. In December 2016, Acclarent filed a petition for Inter Partes Review (IPR) with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) challenging the validity of the ’412 patent. The USPTO instituted the IPR in July 2017. In July 2018, the USPTO ruled in favor of Albritton in the IPR, finding that Acclarent had not met its burden of proof that the challenged claims were invalid. In October 2019, the Court of Appeals affirmed the USPTO’s Patent Trial and Appeal Board. In June 2019, the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment in the district court and the parties are awaiting a decision. The district court trial is scheduled for April 2020. In November 2017, Board of Regents, The University of Texas System and TissueGen, Inc. (collectively, UT) filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas against Ethicon, Inc. and Ethicon US, LLC alleging the manufacture and sale of VICRYL ® Plus Antibacterial Sutures, MONOCRYL ® Plus Antibacterial Sutures, PDS ® Plus Antibacterial Sutures, STRATAFIX ® PDS ® Antibacterial Sutures and STRATAFIX ® MONOCRYL ® Plus Antibacterial Sutures infringe plaintiffs’ United States Patent Nos. 6,596,296 and 7,033,603 (the ’603 patent) directed to implantable polymer drug releasing biodegradable fibers containing a therapeutic agent. UT is seeking damages and an injunction. In December 2018, Ethicon filed petitions with the USPTO, seeking Inter Partes Review (IPR) of both asserted patents. Those petitions have been stayed by the USPTO pending a decision by the U.S. Supreme Court in an unrelated case. UT dismissed the ’603 patent from 88 the suit and no longer accuses PDS ® Plus Antibacterial Sutures or STRATAFIX ® PDS ® Plus Antibacterial Sutures of infringement. The district court trial is scheduled for June 2020. In August 2018, Intuitive Surgical, Inc. and Intuitive Surgical Operations, Inc. (“Intuitive”) filed a patent infringement suit against Auris Health, Inc. (“Auris”) in United States District Court for the District of Delaware. In the suit, Intuitive alleges willful infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 6,246,200 (’200 patent); 6,491,701 (’701 patent); 6,522,906 (’906 patent); 6,800,056 (’056 patent); 8,142,447 (’447 patent); 8,620,473 (’473 patent); 8,801,601 (’601 patent); and 9,452,276 (’276 patent) based on Auris’ Monarch™ Platform. Auris filed Petitions for Inter Partes Review with the USPTO regarding the ’200, ’056, ’601 ’701, ’447, ’276 and ’906 patents. In December 2019, the USPTO instituted review of the ’601 patent and denied review of the ’056 patent. The district court trial is scheduled to begin in January 2021. In August 2019, RSB Spine LLC (“RSB Spine”) filed a patent infringement suit against DePuy Synthes, Inc. in United States District Court for the District of Delaware. In October 2019, RSB Spine amended the complaint to change the named defendants to DePuy Synthes Sales, Inc. and DePuy Synthes Products, Inc. In the suit, RSB Spine alleges willful infringement of United States Patent Nos. 6,984,234 and 9,713, 537 by one or more of the following products: ZERO-P-VA™ Spacer, ZERO-P ® Spacer, ZERO-P NATURAL™ Plate, SYNFIX ® LR Spacer and SYNFIX ® Evolution System. RSB Spine seeks monetary damages and injunctive relief. In November 2019, the suit was consolidated for pre-trial purposes with other patent infringement suits brought by RSB Spine in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware against Life Spine, Inc., Medacta USA, Inc., Precision Spine, Inc., and Xtant Medical Holdings, Inc. Pharmaceutical In August 2016, Sandoz Ltd and Hexal AG (collectively, Sandoz) filed a lawsuit in the English High Court against G.D. Searle LLC, a Pfizer company (Searle) and Janssen Sciences Ireland UC (JSI) alleging that Searle’s supplementary protection certificate SPC/GB07/038 (SPC), which is exclusively licensed to JSI, is invalid and should be revoked. Janssen-Cilag Limited sells PREZISTA ® (darunavir) in the United Kingdom pursuant to this license. In October 2016, Searle and JSI counterclaimed against Sandoz for threatened infringement of the SPC based on statements of its plans to launch generic darunavir in the United Kingdom. Sandoz admitted that its generic darunavir product would infringe the SPC if it is found valid. Searle and JSI are seeking an order enjoining Sandoz from marketing its generic darunavir before the expiration of the SPC. Following a trial in April 2017, the court entered a decision holding that the SPC is valid and granting a final injunction. Sandoz has appealed the court’s decision and the injunction is stayed pending the appeal. In January 2018, the court referred the issue on appeal to the Court of Justice for the European Union (CJEU) and stayed the proceedings pending the CJEU’s ruling on the issue. In December 2019, the parties entered into a settlement agreement. In April 2018, Acerta Pharma B.V., AstraZeneca UK Ltd and AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware against Pharmacyclics LLC and Abbvie Inc. (collectively, Abbvie), alleging that the manufacture and sale of IMBRUVICA ® infringes U.S. Patent No. 7,459,554. Janssen Biotech, Inc., which commercializes IMBRUVICA ® jointly with Abbvie, intervened in the action in November 2018. In October 2019, the parties entered into a settlement agreement. REMICADE ® Related Cases In August 2014, Celltrion Healthcare Co. Ltd. and Celltrion Inc. (collectively, Celltrion) filed an application with the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for approval to make and sell its own infliximab biosimilar. In March 2015, Janssen Biotech, Inc. (JBI) filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts against Celltrion and Hospira Healthcare Corporation (Hospira), which has exclusive marketing rights for Celltrion’s infliximab biosimilar in the United States, seeking, among other things, a declaratory judgment that their biosimilar product infringes or potentially infringes several JBI patents, including United States Patent No. 6,284,471 relating to REMICADE ® (infliximab) (the ’471 patent) and United States Patent No. 7,598,083 (the ’083 patent) directed to the cell culture media used to make Celltrion’s biosimilar. In August 2016, the district court granted both Celltrion’s and Hospira’s motions for summary judgment of invalidity of the ’471 patent. JBI appealed those decisions to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In January 2018, the Federal Circuit dismissed the appeal as moot based on its affirmance of a decision by the USPTO’s Patent Trial and Appeal Board affirming invalidity of the ’471 patent. In June 2016, JBI filed two additional patent infringement lawsuits asserting the ’083 patent, one against Celltrion and Hospira in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts and the other against HyClone Laboratories, Inc., the manufacturer of the cell culture media that Celltrion uses to make its biosimilar product, in the United States District Court for the District of Utah. JBI seeks monetary damages and other relief. In October 2017, the district court in the Massachusetts 89 action denied Celltrion and Hospira’s motion to dismiss for lack of standing. In July 2018, the district court in the Massachusetts action granted Celltrion’s motion for summary judgment of non-infringement and entered an order dismissing the ’083 lawsuit against Celltrion and Hospira. JBI appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, and Celltrion and Hospira cross-appealed on the standing issue. A hearing on the appeal and cross-appeal is scheduled for March 2020. The litigation against HyClone in Utah is stayed pending the outcome of the Massachusetts actions. The FDA approved the first infliximab biosimilar for sale in the United States in 2016, and a number of such products have been launched. Litigation Against Filers of Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) The following summarizes lawsuits pending against generic companies that have filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) with the FDA or undertaken similar regulatory processes outside of the United States, seeking to market generic forms of products sold by various subsidiaries of Johnson & Johnson prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. These ANDAs typically include allegations of non-infringement and invalidity of the applicable patents. In the event the subsidiaries are not successful in an action, or the automatic statutory stay of the ANDAs expires before the United States District Court rulings are obtained, the third-party companies involved would have the ability, upon approval of the FDA, to introduce generic versions of their products to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for the applicable products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. In addition, from time to time, subsidiaries may settle these types of actions and such settlements can involve the introduction of generic versions of the products at issue to the market prior to the expiration of the relevant patents. The Inter Partes Review (IPR) process with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), created under the 2011 America Invents Act, is also being used at times by generic companies in conjunction with ANDAs and lawsuits, to challenge the applicable patents. ZYTIGA ® In July 2015, Janssen Biotech, Inc., Janssen Oncology, Inc. and Janssen Research & Development, LLC (collectively, Janssen) and BTG International Ltd. (BTG) initiated a patent infringement lawsuit (the main action) in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey against a number of generic companies (and certain of their affiliates and/or suppliers) who filed ANDAs seeking approval to market a generic version of ZYTIGA ® 250mg before the expiration of United States Patent No. 8,822,438 (the ’438 patent). The generic companies include Amneal Pharmaceuticals, LLC and Amneal Pharmaceuticals of New York, LLC (collectively, Amneal); Apotex Inc. and Apotex Corp. (collectively, Apotex); Citron Pharma LLC (Citron); Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Ltd. and Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Inc. (collectively, Dr. Reddy’s); Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Mylan Inc. (collectively, Mylan); Par Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Par Pharmaceutical Companies, Inc. (collectively, Par); Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. (Teva); Wockhardt Bio A.G.; Wockhardt USA LLC and Wockhardt Ltd. (collectively, Wockhardt); West-Ward Pharmaceutical Corp. (West-Ward) and Hikma Pharmaceuticals, LLC (Hikma). Janssen and BTG also initiated patent infringement lawsuits in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey against Amerigen Pharmaceuticals Limited (Amerigen) in May 2016, and Glenmark Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Glenmark) in June 2016, each of whom filed an ANDA seeking approval to market its generic version of ZYTIGA ® before the expiration of the ’438 patent. These lawsuits were consolidated with the main action. In August 2015, Janssen and BTG filed an additional jurisdictional protective lawsuit against the Mylan defendants in the United States District Court for the Northern District of West Virginia, which has been stayed. In August 2017, Janssen and BTG initiated a patent infringement lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey against Teva, who filed an ANDA seeking approval to market a generic version of ZYTIGA ® 500mg before the expiration of the ’438 patent. This lawsuit has been consolidated with the main action. In December 2017, Janssen and BTG entered into a settlement agreement with Glenmark. In February 2018, Janssen and BTG filed a patent infringement lawsuit against MSN Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and MSN Laboratories Private Limited (collectively, MSN) in United States District Court for the District of New Jersey based on its ANDA seeking approval for a generic version of ZYTIGA ® prior to the expiration of the ’438 patent. In February 2019, the action was stayed pending the outcome of the main action. In April 2018, Janssen and BTG entered into a settlement agreement with Apotex. 90 In October 2018, the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey issued a ruling invalidating all asserted claims of the ’438 patent. The court held that the patent claims would be infringed if the patent were valid. Janssen appealed the court’s decision. In November 2018, Janssen and BTG initiated a patent infringement lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey against Qilu Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. and Qilu Pharma, Inc. (collectively, Qilu), who filed an ANDA seeking approval to market a generic version of ZYTIGA ® before the expiration of the ’438 patent. Janssen is seeking an order enjoining Qilu from marketing its generic version of ZYTIGA ® before the expiration of the ’438 patent. In November 2018, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit denied Janssen’s request for an injunction pending appeal. As a result, several generic versions of ZYTIGA ® have entered the market. Several generic companies including Amerigen, Argentum Pharmaceuticals LLC (Argentum), Mylan, Wockhardt, Actavis, Amneal, Dr. Reddy’s, Sun, Teva, West-Ward and Hikma filed Petitions for Inter Partes Review (IPR) with the USPTO, seeking to invalidate the ’438 patent. In January 2018, the USPTO issued decisions finding the ’438 patent claims unpatentable, and Janssen requested rehearing.

GOVERNMENT PROCEEDINGS Like other companies in the pharmaceutical, consumer and medical devices industries, Johnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation by national, state and local government agencies in the United States and other countries in which they operate. As a result, interaction with government agencies is ongoing. The most significant litigation brought by, and investigations conducted by, government agencies are listed below. It is possible that criminal charges and substantial fines and/or civil penalties or damages could result from government investigations or litigation. Average Wholesale Price (AWP) Litigation Johnson & Johnson and several of its pharmaceutical subsidiaries (the J&J AWP Defendants), along with numerous other pharmaceutical companies, were named as defendants in a series of lawsuits in state and federal courts involving allegations that the pricing and marketing of certain pharmaceutical products amounted to fraudulent and otherwise actionable conduct because, among other things, the companies allegedly reported an inflated Average Wholesale Price (AWP) for the drugs at issue. Payors alleged that they used those AWPs in calculating provider reimbursement levels. The plaintiffs in these cases included three classes of private persons or entities that paid for any portion of the purchase of the drugs at issue based on AWP, and state government entities that made Medicaid payments for the drugs at issue based on AWP. Many of these cases, both federal actions and state actions removed to federal court, were consolidated for pre-trial purposes in a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, where all claims against the J&J AWP Defendants were ultimately dismissed. The J&J AWP Defendants also prevailed in a case brought by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Other AWP cases have been resolved through court order or settlement. The case brought by Illinois was settled after trial. In New Jersey, a putative class action based upon AWP allegations is pending against Centocor, Inc. and Ortho Biotech Inc. (both now Janssen Biotech, Inc.), Johnson & Johnson and ALZA Corporation. All other cases have been resolved. Opioid Litigation Beginning in 2014 and continuing to the present, Johnson & Johnson and Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI), along with other pharmaceutical companies, have been named in more than 2,800 lawsuits brought by certain state and local governments related to the marketing of opioids, including DURAGESIC ® , NUCYNTA ® and NUCYNTA ® ER. The suits also raise allegations related to previously owned active pharmaceutical ingredient supplier subsidiaries, Tasmanian Alkaloids Pty, Ltd. and Noramco, Inc. (both subsidiaries were divested in 2016). Similar lawsuits have also been filed by the following groups of plaintiffs: individual plaintiffs on behalf of children suffering from Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome; hospitals; and health insurers/payors. To date, complaints against pharmaceutical companies, including Johnson & Johnson and JPI, have been filed by the state Attorneys General in Arkansas, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, New 96 Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, Washington and West Virginia. Complaints against the manufacturers also have been filed in state or federal court by city, county and local government agencies in the following states: Alabama, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina; Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin. The Government of Puerto Rico filed suit in Superior Court of San Juan. There are more than 350 cases pending in various state courts. There are over 2,500 federal cases coordinated in a federal Multi-District Litigation (MDL) pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio (MDL No. 2804). In addition, the Province of British Columbia filed suit in Canada. In October 2019, an anti-trust complaint was filed by private plaintiffs in federal court in Tennessee and is pending transfer to the MDL. These actions allege a variety of claims related to opioid marketing practices, including false advertising, unfair competition, public nuisance, consumer fraud violations, deceptive acts and practices, false claims and unjust enrichment. The suits generally seek penalties and/or injunctive and monetary relief and, in some of the suits, the plaintiffs are seeking joint and several liability among the defendants. An adverse judgment in any of these lawsuits could result in the imposition of large monetary penalties and significant damages including, punitive damages, cost of abatement, substantial fines, equitable remedies and other sanctions. The trial in the matter filed by the Oklahoma Attorney General resulted in a judgment against Johnson & Johnson and JPI in the amount of $ 572 million , subject to a final order to be issued by the court. The court issued a final judgment reducing the amount to $ 465 million . Johnson & Johnson and JPI have appealed the judgment. The Company believes that it has strong grounds to overturn this judgment. In October 2019 Johnson & Johnson and JPI announced a settlement of the first case set for trial in the MDL with two counties in Ohio. Johnson & Johnson, JPI and other pharmaceutical companies have also received subpoenas or requests for information related to opioids marketing practices from the following state Attorneys General: Alaska, Indiana, Montana, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Washington. In September 2017, Johnson & Johnson and JPI were contacted by the Texas and Colorado Attorney General’s Offices on behalf of approximately 38 states regarding a multi-state Attorney General investigation. In October 2019, the Company announced a proposed agreement in principle that would include the Company paying $ 4 billion as settlement of these lawsuits, subject to various conditions and an agreement being finalized. This agreement in principle is not an admission of liability or wrong-doing and would resolve opioid lawsuits filed and future claims by states, cities and counties. The Company cannot predict if or when the agreement will be finalized and individual cases are ongoing, including a trial in New York scheduled to commence in March 2020. In August 2019, Johnson & Johnson received a grand jury subpoena from the United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York for documents related to the Company’s anti-diversion policies and procedures and distribution of its opioid medications, in what the Company understands to be part of a broader investigation into manufacturers’ and distributors’ monitoring programs and reporting under the Controlled Substances Act. In September 2019, Johnson & Johnson received subpoenas from the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) as part of an industry-wide inquiry into the effect of opioid prescriptions on New York health insurance premiums. The Company is cooperating and producing documents in response to the various subpoenas and requests for information. Other In August 2012, DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc., DePuy, Inc. (now known as DePuy Synthes, Inc.), and Johnson & Johnson Services, Inc. (collectively DePuy) received an informal request from the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts and the Civil Division of the United States Department of Justice (the United States) for the production of materials relating to the DePuy ASR™ XL Hip device. In July 2014, the United States notified the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts that it had declined to intervene in a qui tam case filed pursuant to the False Claims Act against the companies. In February 2016, the district court granted the companies’ motion to dismiss with prejudice, unsealed the qui tam complaint, and denied the qui tam relators’ request for leave to file a further amended complaint. The qui tam relators appealed the case to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. In July 2017, the First Circuit affirmed the district court’s dismissal in part, reversed in part, and affirmed the decision to deny the relators’ request to file a third amended complaint. The relators’ remaining claims are now pending before the district court, and fact discovery is currently scheduled to close in March 2020. In October 2012, Johnson & Johnson was contacted by the California Attorney General's office regarding a multi-state Attorney General investigation of the marketing of surgical mesh products for hernia and urogynecological purposes by Johnson & Johnson's subsidiary, Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon). In May 2016, California and Washington filed civil complaints against Johnson & Johnson, Ethicon and Ethicon US, LLC alleging violations of their consumer protection statutes. In April 2019, Johnson & Johnson and Ethicon settled the Washington case. The California case started trial in July 2019 and concluded in September 97 2019. In January 2020, the court found in favor of the state and awarded the state civil penalties of approximately $ 344 million . The Company intends to appeal when further proceedings are concluded in the trial court. Similar complaints were filed against the companies by Kentucky in August 2016, by Mississippi in October 2017, by West Virginia in September 2019 and by Oregon in December 2019. The trial date for the Kentucky case was scheduled for September 2019 but has been adjourned and no new trial date has been scheduled. In October 2019, Johnson & Johnson and Ethicon settled the multi-state investigation with 41 other states and the District of Columbia. In December 2012, Therakos, Inc. (Therakos), formerly a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson and part of the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Inc. (OCD) franchise, received a letter from the civil division of the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania informing Therakos that the United States Attorney's Office was investigating the sales and marketing of Uvadex ® (methoxsalen) and the Uvar Xts ® and Cellex ® Systems during the period 2000 to the present. The United States Attorney's Office requested that OCD and Johnson & Johnson preserve documents that could relate to the investigation. Therakos was subsequently acquired by an affiliate of Gores Capital Partners III, L.P. in January 2013, and OCD was divested in June 2014. Following the divestiture of OCD, Johnson & Johnson retains OCD’s portion of any liability that may result from the investigation for activity that occurred prior to the sale of Therakos. In March 2014 and March 2016, the United States Attorney’s Office requested that Johnson & Johnson produce certain documents, and Johnson & Johnson is cooperating with those requests. In June 2014, the Mississippi Attorney General filed a complaint in Chancery Court of The First Judicial District of Hinds County, Mississippi against Johnson & Johnson and Johnson & Johnson Consumer Companies, Inc. (now known as Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc.) (JJCI). The complaint alleges that defendants violated the Mississippi Consumer Protection Act by failing to disclose alleged health risks associated with female consumers' use of talc contained in JOHNSON'S ® Baby Powder and JOHNSON'S ® Shower to Shower (a product divested in 2012) and seeks injunctive and monetary relief. The matter is stayed pending interlocutory appeal of a December 2018 denial of Johnson & Johnson and JJCI's motion for summary judgment. The Mississippi Supreme Court granted J&J and JJCI's request to file an interlocutory appeal of the denial of the motion for summary judgment in late 2019 and it will soon establish a briefing schedule. The Company has also received inquiries from several other State Attorneys General. In March 2016, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI) received a Civil Investigative Demand from the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York related to JPI’s contractual relationships with pharmacy benefit managers over the period from January 1, 2006 to the present with regard to certain of JPI's pharmaceutical products. The demand was issued in connection with an investigation under the False Claims Act. In July 2016, Johnson & Johnson and Janssen Products LP were served with a qui tam complaint pursuant to the False Claims Act filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey alleging the off-label promotion of two HIV products, PREZISTA ® and INTELENCE ® , and anti-kickback violations in connection with the promotion of these products. The complaint was filed under seal in December 2012. The federal and state governments have declined to intervene, and the lawsuit is being prosecuted by the relators. In January 2017, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI) received a Civil Investigative Demand from the United States Department of Justice relating to allegations concerning the sales and marketing practices of OLYSIO ® . In December 2017, Johnson & Johnson and JPI were served with a whistleblower lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California alleging the off-label promotion of OLYSIO ® and additional products, including NUCYNTA ® , XARELTO ® , LEVAQUIN ® and REMICADE ® . At this time, the federal and state governments have declined to intervene and the lawsuit, which is related to the Civil Investigative Demand, is being prosecuted by a former company employee. The United States District Court for the Central District of California dismissed the claim in April 2018. In May 2018, the relator filed a notice of appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. In January 2020, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit dismissed the relator's appeal. In November 2018, a second whistleblower lawsuit was unsealed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. The lawsuit was substantially similar to the lawsuit under appeal but was brought in the name of the original relator. The federal and state governments declined to intervene in the second suit, and the relator moved to dismiss the lawsuit without prejudice. In April 2019, the court granted the relator's motion and dismissed the complaint without prejudice. In March 2017, Janssen Biotech, Inc. received a Civil Investigative Demand from the United States Department of Justice regarding a False Claims Act investigation concerning management and advisory services provided to rheumatology and gastroenterology practices that purchased REMICADE ® or SIMPONI ARIA ® . In August 2019, the Unites States Department of Justice notified Janssen Biotech, Inc. that it was closing the investigation. In January 2020, Janssen Biotech, Inc. was served with a newly-unsealed qui tam suit filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. 98 In April and September 2017, Johnson & Johnson received subpoenas from the United States Attorney for the District of Massachusetts seeking documents broadly relating to pharmaceutical copayment support programs for DARZALEX ® , OLYSIO ® , REMICADE ® , SIMPONI ® , STELARA ® and ZYTIGA ® . The subpoenas also seek documents relating to Average Manufacturer Price and Best Price reporting to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services related to those products, as well as rebate payments to state Medicaid agencies. In June 2017, Johnson & Johnson received a subpoena from the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts seeking information regarding practices pertaining to the sterilization of DePuy Synthes, Inc. spinal implants at three hospitals in Boston as well as interactions of employees of Company subsidiaries with physicians at these hospitals. Johnson & Johnson and DePuy Synthes, Inc. have produced documents in response to the subpoena and are fully cooperating with the government’s investigation. In July 2018 the Public Prosecution Service in Rio de Janeiro and representatives from the Brazilian antitrust authority CADE inspected the offices of more than 30 companies including Johnson & Johnson do Brasil Indústria e Comércio de Produtos para Saúde Ltda. The authorities appear to be investigating allegations of possible anti-competitive behavior and possible improper payments in the medical device industry. The United States Department of Justice and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission have made additional inquiries, and Johnson & Johnson do Brasil Indústria e Comércio de Produtos para Saúde Ltda. is cooperating with those requests. In January 2020, the New Mexico Attorney General’s Office filed a suit against Johnson & Johnson and Johnson & Johnson Consumer Companies, Inc. in the First Judicial District Court, New Mexico. The suit relates to the safety and marketing of the Company’s talc products. The State included claims for violations of the New Mexico Unfair Practices Act, Medicaid Fraud Act, Fraud Against Taxpayers Act, Fraud and Negligent Misrepresentation, Negligence and Unjust Enrichment. Other state Attorneys General have informed the Company that they are conducting an inquiry into this matter. From time to time, the Company has received requests from a variety of United States Congressional Committees to produce information relevant to ongoing congressional inquiries. It is the policy of Johnson & Johnson to cooperate with these inquiries by producing the requested information. GENERAL LITIGATION In May 2014, two purported class actions were filed in federal court, one in the United States District Court for the Central District of California and one in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Illinois, against Johnson & Johnson and Johnson & Johnson Consumer Companies, Inc. (now known as Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc.) (JJCI) alleging violations of state consumer fraud statutes based on nondisclosure of alleged health risks associated with talc contained in JOHNSON'S ® Baby Powder and JOHNSON'S ® Shower to Shower (a product no longer sold by JJCI). Both cases seek injunctive relief and monetary damages; neither includes a claim for personal injuries. In October 2016, both cases were transferred to the United States District Court for the District Court of New Jersey as part of a newly created federal multi-district litigation. In July 2017, the district court granted Johnson & Johnson's and JJCI’s motion to dismiss one of the cases. In September 2018, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed this dismissal. In September 2017, the plaintiff in the second case voluntarily dismissed the complaint. In March 2018, the plaintiff in the second case refiled in Illinois State Court. In August 2014, United States Customs and Border Protection (US CBP) issued a Penalty Notice against Janssen Ortho LLC (Janssen Ortho), assessing penalties for the alleged improper classification of darunavir ethanolate (the active pharmaceutical ingredient in PREZISTA ® ) in connection with its importation into the United States. In October 2014, Janssen Ortho submitted a Petition for Relief in response to the Penalty Notice. In May 2015, US CBP issued an Amended Penalty Notice assessing substantial penalties and Janssen Ortho filed a Petition for Relief in July 2015. In May 2019, US CBP issued its Mitigation Decision and determined that Janssen Ortho had negligently misrepresented that darunavir ethanolate is entitled to duty free treatment. In June 2019, Janssen Ortho filed a Supplemental Petition for Relief. The Penalties Proceeding will be impacted by the related Classification Litigation pending in the United States Court of International Trade. The Classification Litigation will determine whether darunavir ethanolate was properly classified as exempt from duties upon importation into the United States. The trial in the Classification Litigation was held in July 2019. In February 2020, the Court ruled that darunavir ethanolate is eligible for duty free treatment. In March and April 2015, over 30 putative class action complaints were filed by contact lens patients in a number of courts around the United States against Johnson & Johnson Vision Care, Inc. (JJVCI) and other contact lens manufacturers, distributors, and retailers, alleging vertical and horizontal conspiracies to fix the retail prices of contact lenses. The complaints 99 allege that the manufacturers reached agreements with each other and certain distributors and retailers concerning the prices at which some contact lenses could be sold to consumers. The plaintiffs are seeking damages and injunctive relief. All of the class action cases were transferred to the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida in June 2015. The plaintiffs filed a consolidated class action complaint in November 2015. In December 2018, the district court granted the plaintiffs' motion for class certification. Defendants filed two motions for interlocutory appeal of class certification to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. Both motions were denied. Defendants' motions for summary judgment were denied in November 2019. Trial is scheduled for June 2020. In August 2015, two third-party payors filed a purported class action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana against Janssen Research & Development, LLC, Janssen Ortho LLC, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Ortho-McNeil-Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Johnson & Johnson (as well as certain Bayer entities), alleging that the defendants improperly marketed and promoted XARELTO ® as safer and more effective than less expensive alternative medications while failing to fully disclose its risks. The complaint seeks damages. In September 2017, Pfizer, Inc. (Pfizer) filed an antitrust complaint against Johnson & Johnson and Janssen Biotech, Inc. (collectively, Janssen) in United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Pfizer alleges that Janssen has violated federal antitrust laws through its contracting strategies for REMICADE ® . The complaint seeks damages and injunctive relief. Discovery is ongoing. Beginning in September 2017, multiple purported class actions of direct and indirect purchasers were filed against Johnson & Johnson and Janssen Biotech, Inc. (collectively, Janssen) alleging that Janssen’s REMICADE ® contracting strategies violated federal and state antitrust and consumer laws and seeking damages and injunctive relief. In November 2017, the cases were consolidated for pre-trial purposes in United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania as In re Remicade Antitrust Litigation. Motions to dismiss were denied in both the direct and indirect purchaser cases. A motion to compel arbitration of the direct purchaser case was denied by the district court. The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed the district court's ruling. In June 2018, Walgreen Co. and Kroger Co, filed an antitrust complaint against Johnson & Johnson and Janssen Biotech, Inc. (collectively, Janssen) in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The complaint alleges that Janssen has violated federal antitrust laws through its contracting strategies for REMICADE ® . The complaint seeks damages and injunctive relief. In March 2019, summary judgment was granted in favor of Janssen. This ruling is on appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. In June 2019, the United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issued a Civil Investigative Demand to Johnson & Johnson in connection with its investigation of whether Janssen’s REMICADE ® contracting practices violate federal antitrust laws. The Company has produced documents and information responsive to the Civil Investigative Demand. In October 2017, certain United States service members and their families brought a complaint against a number of pharmaceutical and medical devices companies, including Johnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries, alleging that the defendants violated the United States Anti-Terrorism Act. The complaint alleges that the defendants provided funding for terrorist organizations through their sales practices pursuant to pharmaceutical and medical device contracts with the Iraqi Ministry of Health. In January 2019, plaintiffs' motion to file a Second Amended Complaint adding plaintiffs to the lawsuit was granted. In April 2019, the Company moved to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint. In October 2018, two separate putative class actions were filed against Actelion Pharmaceutical Ltd., Actelion Pharmaceuticals US, Inc., and Actelion Clinical Research, Inc. (collectively Actelion) in United States District Court for the District of Maryland and United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The complaints allege that Actelion violated state and federal antitrust and unfair competition laws by allegedly refusing to supply generic pharmaceutical manufacturers with samples of TRACLEER ® . TRACLEER ® is subject to a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, which imposes restrictions on distribution of the product. In January 2019, the plaintiffs dismissed the District of Columbia case and filed a consolidated complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland. In October 2019, the Court granted Actelion’s motion to dismiss the amended complaint. Plaintiffs have appealed the decision. In December 2018, Janssen Biotech, Inc., Janssen Oncology, Inc, Janssen Research & Development, LLC, and Johnson & Johnson (collectively, Janssen) were served with a qui tam complaint filed on behalf of the United States, 28 states, and the District of Columbia. The complaint, which was filed in December 2017 in United States District Court for the Northern District of California, alleges that Janssen violated the federal False Claims Act and state law when providing pricing information for ZYTIGA ® to the government in connection with direct government sales and government-funded drug 100 reimbursement programs. At this time, the federal and state governments have declined to intervene. The case has been transferred to United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. Janssen has moved to dismiss the complaint. In April 2019, Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Louisiana and HMO Louisiana, Inc. filed a class action complaint against Janssen Biotech, Inc, Janssen Oncology, Inc, Janssen Research & Development, LLC and BTG International Limited in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. Several additional complaints were filed thereafter. The complaints generally allege that the defendants violated the antitrust and consumer protections laws of several states and the Sherman Act by pursuing patent litigation relating to ZYTIGA ® in order to delay generic entry. The case has been transferred to the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey and consolidated for pretrial purposes. In May 2019, a class action antitrust complaint was filed against Janssen R&D Ireland (Janssen) and Johnson & Johnson. The complaint alleges that Janssen violated federal and state antitrust and consumer protection laws by agreeing to exclusivity provisions in its agreements with Gilead concerning the development and marketing of combination antiretroviral therapies (cART) to treat HIV. The complaint also alleges that Gilead entered into similar agreements with Bristol-Myers-Squibb and Japan Tobacco. The case is pending in the United States District Court for the District of Northern California. The defendants have filed motions to dismiss the complaint. In October 2019, Innovative Health, LLC filed a complaint against Biosense Webster, Inc. (BWI) in the United States District Court for the Middle District of California. The complaint alleges that certain of BWI’s business practices and contractual terms violate the antitrust laws of the United States and the State of California by restricting competition in the sale of High Density Mapping Catheters and Ultrasound Catheters. BWI filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. The Company received notices from Pfizer, Inc. and Sanofi Consumer Health, Inc. in November 2019 and Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in January 2020 tendering for defense and indemnification of legal claims related to personal injury matters and putative class actions in the U.S. and Canada related to Zantac (ranitidine) products. The notices were based on certain indemnification provisions regarding assumed liabilities in connection with the Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement between Pfizer, Inc. and the Company in 2006. Plaintiffs in the underlying suits allege generally that Zantac and other over-the-counter ranitidine medications contain unsafe levels of NDMA (N-nitrosodimethylamine) and can cause and/or have caused various cancers in patients using the products, for which plaintiffs are seeking injunctive and monetary relief. Johnson & Johnson or its subsidiaries are also parties to a number of proceedings brought under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund, and comparable state, local or foreign laws in which the primary relief sought is the cost of past and/or future remediation. 101 22. Restructuring The Company announced plans to implement a series of actions across its Global Supply Chain that are intended to focus resources and increase investments in the critical capabilities, technologies and solutions necessary to manufacture and supply its product portfolio, enhance agility and drive growth. The Global Supply Chain actions will include expanding the use of strategic collaborations and bolstering initiatives to reduce complexity, improve cost-competitiveness, enhance capabilities and optimize the Supply Chain network. For additional details on the global supply chain restructuring strategic collaborations see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2019, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $ 0.6 billion , which is included on the following lines of the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, $ 0.3 billion in restructuring, $ 0.2 billion in other (income) expense and $ 0.1 billion in cost of products sold. Total project costs of approximately $ 0.8 billion have been recorded since the restructuring was announced. See the following table for additional details on the restructuring program. In total, the Company expects the Global Supply Chain actions to generate approximately $ 0.6 billion to $ 0.8 billion in annual pre-tax cost savings that will be substantially delivered by 2022. The Company expects to record pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $ 1.9 billion to $ 2.3 billion , over the 4 to 5 year period of this activity. These costs are associated with network optimizations, exit costs and accelerated depreciation and amortization. The following table summarizes the severance charges and the associated spending under these initiatives through the fiscal year ended 2019: (Dollars in Millions) Severance Asset Write-offs Other (2) Total Reserve balance, December 31, 2017 229 — 38 267 2018 activity ( 35 ) — 10 ( 25 ) Reserve balance, December 30, 2018 194 — 48 242 Current year activity: Charges — 151 460 611 Cash payments ( 30 ) — ( 424 ) ( 454 ) Settled non cash — ( 151 ) ( 68 ) (3) ( 219 ) Reserve balance, December 29, 2019 (1) $ 164 — 16 180 (1) Cash outlays for severance are expected to be substantially paid out over the next 2 years in accordance with the Company's plans and local laws. (2) Other includes project expense such as salaries for employees supporting these initiatives and consulting expenses. (3) Relates to pension related actuarial losses associated with the transfer of employees to Jabil Inc. as part of the strategic collaboration. The Company continuously reevaluates its severance reserves related to restructuring and the timing of payments due to the planned release of associates regarding several longer-term projects. The Company believes that the existing severance reserves are sufficient to cover the Global Supply Chain plans given the period over which the actions will take place. The Company will continue to assess and make adjustments as necessary if additional amounts become probable and estimable. 102 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Johnson & Johnson Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 29, 2019 and December 30, 2018, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, of comprehensive income, of equity, and of cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended December 29, 2019, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 29, 2019 based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 29, 2019 and December 30, 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended December 29, 2019 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 29, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. Basis for Opinions The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. As described in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management has excluded Ci:z Holdings Co., Ltd., (“DR. CI:LABO”) from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 29, 2019, because it was acquired by the Company in a business combination during 2019. We have also excluded DR. CI:LABO from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. DR. CI:LABO is wholly-owned subsidiary whose total assets, excluding intangible assets and goodwill, and total sales excluded from management’s assessment and our audit of internal control over financial reporting represent less than 1% of each of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and 103 dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. U.S. Pharmaceutical Rebate Reserves - Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied. Rebates and discounts provided to customers are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales. The liability for such rebates and discounts is recognized within Accrued Rebates, Returns and Promotions on the consolidated balance sheet. A significant portion of the liability related to rebates is from the sale of pharmaceutical goods within the U.S., primarily the Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid programs, which amounted to $7.0 billion as of December 29, 2019. For significant rebate programs, which include the U.S. Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid rebate programs, rebates and discounts estimated by management are based on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis, and projected market conditions in the U.S. pharmaceutical market. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to U.S. pharmaceutical rebate reserves - Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid is a critical audit matter are the use of significant judgment by management due to the significant measurement uncertainty involved in developing these reserves. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment and subjectivity and audit effort in applying procedures for the assumptions related to contractual terms with customers, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis, and projected market conditions in the U.S. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to U.S. pharmaceutical rebate reserves - Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid, including controls over the assumptions used to estimate these rebates. These procedures also included, among others, (i) developing an independent estimate of the rebates by utilizing third party information on price and market conditions in the U.S., the terms of the specific rebate programs, and the historical trend of actual rebate claims paid; (ii) testing rebate claims processed by the Company, including evaluating those claims for consistency with the contractual and mandated terms of the Company’s rebate arrangements; and (iii) comparing the independent estimate to management’s estimates. Litigation Contingencies - Talc As described in Notes 1 and 21 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with legal matters, including talc, when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. To the extent adverse verdicts have been rendered against the Company, management does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated. For these matters, management is unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors, including, among other things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and unpredictability of the number of potential claims; or there are numerous parties involved. There have been verdicts against the Company for this matter, including a verdict in July 2018 of $4.7 billion. As described by management, the Company believes 104 that it has strong grounds on appeal to overturn these verdicts. The Company has established an accrual primarily for defense costs i n connection with product liability litigation associated with body powders containing talc. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the talc litigation is a critical audit matter are the use of significant judgment by management when assessing the likelihood of a loss being incurred and management’s determination of whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss for each claim can be made. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment and effort in evaluating management’s assessment of the loss contingencies associated with this litigation. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s evaluation of the talc litigation, including controls over determining whether a loss is probable and whether the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, as well as financial statement disclosures. These procedures also included, among others, (i) gaining an understanding of the Company’s process around the accounting and reporting for the talc litigation; (ii) discussing the status of significant known actual and potential litigation with the Company’s in-house legal counsel, as well as external counsel when deemed necessary; (iii) obtaining and evaluating the letters of audit inquiry with internal and external legal counsel for significant litigation; (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assessment regarding whether an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible or probable and reasonably estimable; and (v) evaluating the sufficiency of the Company’s litigation contingencies disclosures. Litigation - Opioids As described in Notes 18 and 21 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with legal matters, including opioids, when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. To the extent adverse verdicts have been rendered against the Company, management does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated. For these matters, management is unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors, including, among other things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and unpredictability of the number of potential claims; or there are numerous parties involved. The Company has been named in numerous lawsuits brought by certain state and local governments related to opioids matters. The trial in the matter filed by the Oklahoma Attorney General resulted in a judgment against the Company in the amount of $572 million which was subsequently reduced to $465 million. The Company has appealed the judgment and, as described by management, believes that it has strong grounds to overturn this judgment. Separately in October 2019, the Company announced a proposed agreement in principle that would include the Company paying $4 billion as settlement of these lawsuits, subject to various conditions and an agreement being finalized. The Company cannot predict if or when the agreement will be finalized. The Company has recorded a pre-tax charge of $4 billion during the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019 for this matter. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the opioids litigation is a critical audit matter are the use of significant judgment by management when assessing the likelihood of a loss being incurred for the judgment against the Company in Oklahoma and management’s determination of whether a reasonable estimate of the range of loss for the proposed agreement in principle to settle opioids litigation can be made. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment and effort in evaluating management’s assessment of the loss contingencies associated with this litigation. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s evaluation of the opioid litigation, including controls over determining whether a loss is probable and whether the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, as well as financial statement disclosures. These procedures also included, among others, (i) gaining an understanding of the Company’s process around the accounting and reporting for the opioids litigation; (ii) discussing the status of significant known actual and potential litigation and ongoing settlement negotiations with the Company’s in-house legal counsel, as well as external counsel when deemed necessary; (iii) obtaining and evaluating the letters of audit inquiry with internal and external legal counsel for significant litigation; (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assessment regarding whether an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible or probable and reasonably estimable; and (v) evaluating the sufficiency of the Company’s litigation contingencies disclosures. 105 /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Florham Park, New Jersey February 18, 2020 We have served as the Company’s auditor since at least 1920. We have not been able to determine the specific year we began serving as auditor of the Company. 106 Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, management is required to assess the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year and report, based on that assessment, whether the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective. Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the reliability of the Company’s financial reporting and the preparation of external financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal controls over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, internal control over financial reporting determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. The Company’s management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 29, 2019. In making this assessment, the Company used the criteria established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in “Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013).” These criteria are in the areas of control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communication, and monitoring. The Company’s assessment included extensive documenting, evaluating and testing the design and operating effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting. The Company acquired Ci:z Holdings Co., Ltd., (DR. CI:LABO), in a business combination during January 2019. DR. CI:LABO's total assets, excluding intangible assets and goodwill, and total sales represented less than 1% of each of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019. As the acquisition occurred in the fiscal year 2019, the scope of the Company's assessment of the design and effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal year 2019 excluded the above mentioned acquisition. This exclusion is in accordance with the SEC's general guidance that an assessment of a recently acquired business may be omitted from the scope in the year of acquisition. Based on the Company’s processes and assessment, as described above, management has concluded that, as of December 29, 2019, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective. The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 29, 2019 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which appears herein. /s/ Alex Gorsky /s/ Joseph J.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE Not applicable. Item 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures. At the end of the period covered by this Report, the Company evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures. The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Alex Gorsky, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Joseph J. Wolk, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, reviewed and participated in this evaluation. Based on this evaluation, Messrs. Gorsky and Wolk concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Report, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective Reports on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. The information called for by this item is incorporated herein by reference to ""Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting"", and the attestation regarding internal controls over financial reporting included in the ""Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"" included in Item 8 of this Report. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. During the fiscal quarter ended December 29, 2019, there were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required under Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. The Company is implementing a multi-year, enterprise-wide initiative to integrate, simplify and standardize processes and systems for the human resources, information technology, procurement, supply chain and finance functions. These are enhancements to support the growth of the Company’s financial shared service capabilities and standardize financial systems. This initiative is not in response to any identified deficiency or weakness in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. In response to this initiative, the Company has and will continue to align and streamline the design and operation of its financial control environment. Item 9B. OTHER INFORMATION Not applicable.

Management and representatives of Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the ""Company"") also may from time to time make forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements do not relate strictly to historical or current facts and reflect management’s assumptions, views, plans, objectives and projections about the future. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as “plans,” “expects,” “will,” “anticipates,” “estimates” and other words of similar meaning in conjunction with, among other things: discussions of future operations; expected operating results and financial performance; impact of planned acquisitions and dispositions; the Company’s strategy for growth; product development; regulatory approvals; market position and expenditures. Because forward-looking statements are based on current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding future events, they are subject to uncertainties, risks and changes that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of the Company's control. Investors should realize that if underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, or known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, the Company’s actual results and financial condition could vary materially from expectations and projections expressed or implied in its forward-looking statements. Investors are therefore cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements. Risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: Risks Related to Product Development, Market Success and Competition • Challenges and uncertainties inherent in innovation and development of new and improved products and technologies on which the Company’s continued growth and success depend, including uncertainty of clinical outcomes, additional analysis of existing clinical data, obtaining regulatory approvals, health plan coverage and customer access, and initial and continued commercial success; • Challenges to the Company’s ability to obtain and protect adequate patent and other intellectual property rights for new and existing products and technologies in the United States and other important markets; • The impact of patent expirations, typically followed by the introduction of competing biosimilars and generics and resulting revenue and market share losses; • Increasingly aggressive and frequent challenges to the Company’s patents by competitors and others seeking to launch competing generic, biosimilar or other products and increased receptivity of courts, the United States Patent and Trademark Office and other decision makers to such challenges, potentially resulting in loss of market exclusivity and rapid decline in sales for the relevant product sooner than expected; • Competition in research and development of new and improved products, processes and technologies, which can result in product and process obsolescence; • Competition to reach agreement with third parties for collaboration, licensing, development and marketing agreements for products and technologies; • Competition based on cost-effectiveness, product performance, technological advances and patents attained by competitors; and • Allegations that the Company’s products infringe the patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties, which could adversely affect the Company’s ability to sell the products in question and require the payment of money damages and future royalties. Risks Related to Product Liability, Litigation and Regulatory Activity • Product efficacy or safety concerns, whether or not based on scientific evidence, potentially resulting in product withdrawals, recalls, regulatory action on the part of the United States Food and Drug Administration (or international counterparts), declining sales, reputational damage, increased litigation expense and share price impact; • Impact, including declining sales and reputational damage, of significant litigation or government action adverse to the Company, including product liability claims and allegations related to pharmaceutical marketing practices and contracting strategies; • Impact of an adverse judgment or settlement and the adequacy of reserves related to legal proceedings, including patent litigation, product liability, personal injury claims, securities class actions, government investigations, employment and other legal proceedings; • Increased scrutiny of the health care industry by government agencies and state attorneys general resulting in investigations and prosecutions, which carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties, including, but not limited to, debarment from government business; • Failure to meet compliance obligations in the McNEIL-PPC, Inc. Consent Decree or any other compliance agreements with governments or government agencies, which could result in significant sanctions; • Potential changes to applicable laws and regulations affecting United States and international operations, including relating to: approval of new products; licensing and patent rights; sales and promotion of health care products; access to, and reimbursement and pricing for, health care products and services; environmental protection and sourcing of raw materials; • Compliance with local regulations and laws that may restrict the Company’s ability to manufacture or sell its products in relevant markets including, requirements to comply with medical device reporting regulations and other requirements such as the European Union's Medical Devices Regulation; • Changes in domestic and international tax laws and regulations, including changes related to The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the United States, the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing in Switzerland, increasing audit scrutiny by tax authorities around the world and exposures to additional tax liabilities potentially in excess of existing reserves; and • Issuance of new or revised accounting standards by the Financial Accounting Standards Board and regulations by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Risks Related to the Company’s Strategic Initiatives and Healthcare Market Trends • Pricing pressures resulting from trends toward health care cost containment, including the continued consolidation among health care providers and other market participants, trends toward managed care, the shift toward governments increasingly becoming the primary payers of health care expenses, significant new entrants to the health care markets seeking to reduce costs and government pressure on companies to voluntarily reduce costs and price increases; • Restricted spending patterns of individual, institutional and governmental purchasers of health care products and services due to economic hardship and budgetary constraints; • Challenges to the Company’s ability to realize its strategy for growth including through externally sourced innovations, such as development collaborations, strategic acquisitions, licensing and marketing agreements, and the potential heightened costs of any such external arrangements due to competitive pressures; • The potential that the expected strategic benefits and opportunities from any planned or completed acquisition or divestiture by the Company may not be realized or may take longer to realize than expected; and • The potential that the expected benefits and opportunities related to past and ongoing restructuring actions may not be realized or may take longer to realize than expected. Risks Related to Economic Conditions, Financial Markets and Operating Internationally • Market conditions and the possibility that the Company’s share repurchase program may be delayed, suspended or discontinued; • Impact of inflation and fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates and the potential effect of such fluctuations on revenues, expenses and resulting margins; • Potential changes in export/import and trade laws, regulations and policies of the United States and other countries, including any increased trade restrictions or tariffs and potential drug reimportation legislation; • The impact on international operations from financial instability in international economies, sovereign risk, possible imposition of governmental controls and restrictive economic policies, and unstable international governments and legal systems; • Changes to global climate, extreme weather and natural disasters that could affect demand for the Company's products and services, cause disruptions in manufacturing and distribution networks, alter the availability of goods and services within the supply chain, and affect the overall design and integrity of the Company's products and operations; and • The impact of armed conflicts and terrorist attacks in the United States and other parts of the world including social and economic disruptions and instability of financial and other markets. Risks Related to Supply Chain and Operations • Difficulties and delays in manufacturing, internally through third party providers or otherwise within the supply chain, that may lead to voluntary or involuntary business interruptions or shutdowns, product shortages, withdrawals or suspensions of products from the market, and potential regulatory action; • Interruptions and breaches of the Company's information technology systems or those of the Company's vendors which, could result in reputational, competitive, operational or other business harm as well as financial costs and regulatory action; • Reliance on global supply chains and production and distribution processes that are complex and subject to increasing regulatory requirements that may adversely affect supply, sourcing and pricing of materials used in the Company’s products; and • The potential that the expected benefits and opportunities related to restructuring actions contemplated for the global supply chain may not be realized or may take longer to realize than expected, including due to any required approvals from applicable regulatory authorities. Disruptions associated with the announced global supply chain actions may adversely affect supply and sourcing of materials used in the Company's products. Investors also should carefully read the Risk Factors described in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of certain risks that could, among other things, cause the Company’s actual results to differ materially from those expressed in its forward-looking statements. Investors should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and should not consider the risks described above and in Item 1A to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. The Company does not undertake to publicly update any forward-looking statement that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information or future events or developments. PART I Item 1. BUSINESS General Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 135,100 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the health care field. Johnson & Johnson is a holding company, which has more than 260 operating companies conducting business in virtually all countries of the world. The Company’s primary focus is products related to human health and well-being. Johnson & Johnson was incorporated in the State of New Jersey in 1887. The Executive Committee of Johnson & Johnson is the principal management group responsible for the strategic operations and allocation of the resources of the Company. This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities of the Company's three business segments: Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. Within the strategic parameters provided by the Committee, senior management groups at U.S. and international operating companies are each responsible for their own strategic plans and the day-to-day operations of those companies. Each subsidiary within the business segments is, with limited exceptions, managed by residents of the country where located. Segments of Business The Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. Additional information required by this item is incorporated herein by reference to the narrative and tabular descriptions of segments and operating results under: “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition” of this Report; and Note 18 “Segments of Business and Geographic Areas” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Consumer The Consumer segment includes a broad range of products used in the baby care, oral care, beauty, over-the-counter pharmaceutical, women’s health and wound care markets. Baby Care includes the JOHNSON’S ® line of products. Oral Care includes the LISTERINE ® product line. Major brands in Beauty include the AVEENO ® ; CLEAN & CLEAR ® ; DABAO ™ ; JOHNSON’S ® Adult; LE PETITE MARSEILLAIS ® ; NEUTROGENA ® and OGX ® product lines. Over-the-counter medicines include the broad family of TYLENOL ® acetaminophen products; SUDAFED ® cold, flu and allergy products; BENADRYL ® and ZYRTEC ® allergy products; MOTRIN ® IB ibuprofen products; and the PEPCID ® line of acid reflux products. Major brands in Women’s Health outside of North America are STAYFREE ® and CAREFREE ® sanitary pads and o.b. ® tampon brands. Wound Care brands include the BAND-AID ® Brand Adhesive Bandages and NEOSPORIN ® First Aid product lines. These products are marketed to the general public and sold both to retail outlets and distributors throughout the world. Pharmaceutical The Pharmaceutical segment is focused on six therapeutic areas: Immunology (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and psoriasis), Infectious Diseases and Vaccines (e.g., HIV/AIDS), Neuroscience (e.g., mood disorders, neurodegenerative disorders and schizophrenia), Oncology (e.g., prostate cancer and hematologic malignancies), Cardiovascular and Metabolism (e.g., thrombosis and diabetes) and Pulmonary Hypertension (e.g., Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension). Medicines in this segment are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers, hospitals and health care professionals for prescription use. Key products in the Pharmaceutical segment include: REMICADE ® (infliximab), a treatment for a number of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases; SIMPONI ® (golimumab), a subcutaneous treatment for adults with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis, active psoriatic arthritis, active ankylosing spondylitis and moderately active to severely active ulcerative colitis; SIMPONI ARIA ® (golimumab), an intravenous treatment for adults with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis, active psoriatic arthritis and active ankylosing spondylitis; STELARA ® (ustekinumab), a treatment for adults and children with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, for adults with active psoriatic arthritis, and for adults with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease; TREMFYA ® (guselkumab), a treatment for adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis; EDURANT ® (rilpivirine), INTELENCE ® (etravirine), PREZISTA ® (darunavir) and PREZCOBIX ® /REZOLSTA ® (darunavir/cobicistat), antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) in combination with other antiretroviral products and SYMTUZA ® ( darunavir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide), a once-daily single tablet regimen for the treatment of HIV ; CONCERTA ® (methylphenidate HCl) extended-release tablets CII, a treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; INVEGA SUSTENNA ® /XEPLION ® (paliperidone palmitate), for the treatment of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder in adults; INVEGA TRINZA ® /TREVICTA ® (paliperidone palmitate), for the treatment of schizophrenia in patients after they have been adequately treated with INVEGA SUSTENNA ® for at least four months; RISPERDAL CONSTA ® (risperidone long-acting injection), for the treatment of schizophrenia and the maintenance treatment of Bipolar 1 Disorder in adults; ZYTIGA ® (abiraterone acetate), a treatment for metastatic castration- 1 resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and metastatic high-risk castration-sensitive prostate cancer; IMBRUVICA ® (ibrutinib), a treatment for certain B-cell malignancies, or blood cancers, chronic graft versus host disease and Waldenström's Macroglobulinemia; DARZALEX ® (daratumumab), a treatment for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma; VELCADE ® (bortezomib), a treatment for multiple myeloma mantle cell lymphoma; PROCRIT ® /EPREX ® (epoetin alfa), a treatment for chemotherapy-induced anemia and patients with chronic kidney disease; XARELTO ® (rivaroxaban), an oral anticoagulant for the prevention of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which may lead to pulmonary embolism (PE) in patients undergoing hip or knee replacement surgery, to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, and for the treatment and reduction of risk of recurrence of DVT and PE; INVOKANA ® (canagliflozin), for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes; INVOKAMET ® /VOKANAMET ® (canagliflozin/metformin HCl), a combination therapy of fixed doses of canagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes; and INVOKAMET ® XR (canagliflozin/metformin hydrochloride extended-release), a once-daily, fixed-dose combination therapy of canagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release, for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes; OPSUMIT ® (macitentan) as monotherapy or in combination, indicated for the long-term treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH); UPTRAVI ® (selexipag), the only approved oral, selective IP receptor agonist targeting a prostacyclin pathway in PAH. Many of these medicines were developed in collaboration with strategic partners or are licensed from other companies and maintain active lifecycle development programs. Medical Devices The Medical Devices segment includes a broad range of products used in the orthopaedic, surgery, interventional solutions (cardiovascular and neurovascular), diabetes care (divested in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2018) and eye health fields. These products are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics. They include orthopaedic products; general surgery, biosurgical, endomechanical and energy products; electrophysiology products to treat cardiovascular disease; sterilization and disinfection products to reduce surgical infection; and vision products such as disposable contact lenses and ophthalmic products related to cataract and laser refractive surgery. Geographic Areas The business of Johnson & Johnson is conducted by more than 260 operating companies located in more than 60 countries, including the U.S., which sell products in virtually all countries throughout the world. The products made and sold in the international business include many of those described above under “– Segments of Business – Consumer,” “– Pharmaceutical” and “– Medical Devices.” However, the principal markets, products and methods of distribution in the international business vary with the country and the culture. The products sold in international business include those developed in the U.S. and by subsidiaries abroad. Investments and activities in some countries outside the U.S. are subject to higher risks than comparable U.S. activities because the investment and commercial climate may be influenced by financial instability in international economies, restrictive economic policies and political and legal system uncertainties. Raw Materials Raw materials essential to the Company's business are generally readily available from multiple sources. Where there are exceptions, the temporary unavailability of those raw materials would not likely have a material adverse effect on the financial results of the Company. Patents The Company's subsidiaries have made a practice of obtaining patent protection on their products and processes where possible. They own, or are licensed under, a significant number of patents in the U.S. and other countries relating to their products, product uses, formulations and manufacturing processes, which in the aggregate are believed to be of material importance to the Company in the operation of its businesses. The Company’s subsidiaries face patent challenges from third parties, including challenges seeking to manufacture and market generic and biosimilar versions of the Company's key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. Significant legal proceedings and claims involving the Company's patent and other intellectual property are described in Note 21, “Legal Proceedings— Intellectual Property” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Sales of the Company’s 2 nd largest product, STELARA ® (ustekinumab), accounted for approximately 6.3% of the Company's total revenues for fiscal 2018. Accordingly, the patents related to this product are believed to be material to the Company. There is one set of granted patents related specifically to STELARA ® . This set of patents is owned by Janssen Biotech, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson. These patents are in force in the U.S. and many countries outside the 2 United States. In the U.S., the latest projected expiration date for patents in this set is 2023 due to a patent term extension. In Europe, the latest projected expiration date for patents in this set is 2024 due to a Supplemental Patent Certificate (patent term extension). In most other countries, the latest projected expiration date is 2021. In addition to competing in the immunology market with STELARA ® , the Company is currently marketing SIMPONI ® (golimumab) and SIMPONI ARIA ® (golimumab), next generation immunology products with remaining patent lives of up to six years. The Company also markets REMICADE ® (infliximab) in the immunology market which is the Company’s largest product. Patents on this product have expired and the Food and Drug Administration approved the first infliximab biosimilar for sale in the U.S. in 2016, and a number of such products have been launched since then. For a more extensive description of legal matters regarding the patents related to REMICADE ® , see Note 21 “Legal Proceedings - Intellectual Property - Pharmaceutical - REMICADE ® Related Cases” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Trademarks The Company’s subsidiaries have made a practice of selling their products under trademarks and of obtaining protection for these trademarks by all available means. These trademarks are protected by registration in the U.S. and other countries where such products are marketed. The Company considers these trademarks in the aggregate to be of material importance in the operation of its businesses. Seasonality Worldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality; however, spending has been heavier in the fourth quarter of each year than in other quarters. This reflects increased spending decisions, principally for advertising and research and development activity. Competition In all of their product lines, the Company's subsidiaries compete with companies both locally and globally. Competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved. Competition in research, both internally and externally sourced, involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. The development of new and innovative products, as well as protecting the underlying intellectual property of the Company’s product portfolio, is important to the Company's success in all areas of its business. The competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research. In addition, the development and maintenance of customer demand for the Company’s consumer products involve significant expenditures for advertising and promotion. Environment The Company is subject to a variety of U.S. and international environmental protection measures. The Company believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations. The Company’s compliance with these requirements did not change during the past year, and is not expected to have a material effect upon its capital expenditures, cash flows, earnings or competitive position. Regulation The Company’s businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which operations are conducted, and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation. In the U.S., the drug, device and cosmetic industries have long been subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies, primarily as to product safety, efficacy, manufacturing, advertising, labeling and safety reporting. The exercise of broad regulatory powers by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the FDA) continues to result in increases in the amounts of testing and documentation required for FDA approval of new drugs and devices and a corresponding increase in the expense of product introduction. Similar trends are also evident in major markets outside of the U.S. The new medical device regulatory framework and the new privacy regulations in Europe are examples of such increased regulation. The costs of human health care have been and continue to be a subject of study, investigation and regulation by governmental agencies and legislative bodies around the world. In the U.S., attention has been focused on drug prices and profits and programs that encourage doctors to write prescriptions for particular drugs, or to recommend, use or purchase particular medical devices. Payers have become a more potent force in the market place and increased attention is being paid to drug and medical device pricing, appropriate drug and medical device utilization and the quality and costs of health care generally. 3 U.S. government agencies continue to implement the extensive requirements of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the ACA). These have both positive and negative impacts on the U.S. healthcare industry with much remaining uncertain as to how various provisions of the ACA, and potential modification or repeal of ACA provisions, will ultimately affect the industry. The regulatory agencies under whose purview the Company operates have administrative powers that may subject it to actions such as product withdrawals, recalls, seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions. In some cases, the Company’s subsidiaries may deem it advisable to initiate product recalls. In addition, business practices in the health care industry have come under increased scrutiny, particularly in the U.S., by government agencies and state attorneys general, and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties. Further, the Company relies on global supply chains, and production and distribution processes, that are complex, are subject to increasing regulatory requirements, and may be faced with unexpected changes such as those resulting from Brexit, that may affect sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in the Company's products. These processes also are subject to lengthy regulatory approvals. Available Information The Company’s main corporate website address is www.jnj.com.

In addition, the written charters of the Audit Committee, the Compensation & Benefits Committee, the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee, the Regulatory Compliance Committee and the Science, Technology & Sustainability Committee of the Board of Directors and the Company’s Principles of Corporate Governance, Code of Business Conduct (for employees), Code of Business Conduct & Ethics for Members of the Board of Directors and Executive Officers, and other corporate governance materials, are available at www.investor.jnj.com/gov.cfm on the Company's website and will be provided without charge to any shareholder submitting a written request, as provided above. The information on the Company’s website is not, and will not be deemed, a part of this Report or incorporated into any other filings the Company makes with the SEC. 4 Item 1A. RISK FACTORS The Company faces a number of uncertainties and risks that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of the Company's control. In addition to the other information in this report and the Company’s other filings with the SEC, investors should consider carefully the factors set forth below. Investors should be aware that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and that the following is not meant to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties. If known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, the Company’s business, results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected, potentially in a material way. Global sales in the Company’s pharmaceutical and medical devices segments may be negatively impacted by healthcare reforms and increasing pricing pressures. Sales of the Company’s pharmaceutical and medical device products are significantly affected by reimbursements by third-party payers such as government healthcare programs, private insurance plans and managed care organizations. As part of various efforts to contain healthcare costs, these payers are putting downward pressure on prices at which products will be reimbursed. In the U.S., increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of Medicare, Medicaid, and private sector beneficiaries, in part due to continued consolidation among health care providers, could result in further pricing pressures. In addition, increased political scrutiny could result in additional pricing pressures. Outside the U.S., numerous major markets, including the EU and Japan, have pervasive government involvement in funding healthcare and, in that regard, directly or indirectly impose price controls, limit access to, or reimbursement for, the Company’s products, or reduce the value of its intellectual property protection. The Company is subject to significant legal proceedings that can result in significant expenses, fines and reputational damage. In the ordinary course of business, Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims and lawsuits involving various issues such as patent disputes, product liability and claims that their product sales, marketing and pricing practices violate various antitrust, unfair trade practices and/or consumer protection laws. The most significant of these proceedings are described in Note 21, “Legal Proceedings” under Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. While the Company believes it has substantial defenses in these matters, it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation. The Company could in the future be required to pay significant amounts as a result of settlements or judgments in these matters, potentially in excess of accruals, including matters where the Company could be held jointly and severally liable among other defendants. The resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and cash flows for that period. Furthermore, as a result of cost and availability factors, effective November 1, 2005, the Company ceased purchasing third-party product liability insurance. Product reliability, safety and effectiveness concerns can have significant negative impacts on sales and results of operations, lead to litigation and cause reputational damage. Concerns about product safety, whether raised internally or by litigants, regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence, can result in safety alerts, product recalls, governmental investigations, regulatory action on the part of the FDA (or its counterpart in other countries), private claims and lawsuits, payment of fines and settlements, declining sales and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in the Company’s products. Product recalls have in the past, and could in the future, prompt government investigations and inspections, the shutdown of manufacturing facilities, continued product shortages and related sales declines, significant remediation costs, reputational damage, possible civil penalties and criminal prosecution. Changes in tax laws or exposures to additional tax liabilities could negatively impact the Company’s operating results. Changes in tax laws or regulations around the world could negatively impact the Company’s effective tax rate and results of operations. A change in statutory tax rate in any country would result in the revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the period in which the new tax law is enacted. This change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The Company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the countries where it operates. Changes to the statutory tax rate may occur at any time, and any related expense or benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the TCJA), which introduced significant changes to U.S. corporate income tax law that will have a meaningful impact on the Company’s provision for income taxes. Accounting for the income tax effects of the TCJA requires significant judgments to be made in interpreting its provisions. Anticipated guidance from the U.S. Treasury about implementing the TCJA, which should be final by June 22, 2019 (18 months after enactment), 5 may result in adjustments that could materially affect the Company’s financial position and results of operations as well as the effective tax rate in the period in which the adjustments are made. On September 28, 2018, the Swiss Parliament approved the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (Swiss Tax Reform). However, a referendum has been called and, as a result, a public vote on the Swiss Tax Reform will take place on May 19th, 2019. I f the Swiss Tax Reform passes, then the measures are expected to come into force in either January 2020 or January 2021. Prior to approval in the referendum and its subsequent cantonal implementation, the proposed Swiss Tax Reform is not enacted and therefore the Company has not reflected any of the potential impacts in its fiscal results. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the proposed Swiss Tax Reform, and when enacted, the law may have a material impact on the Company’s operating results. The Company conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and is addressing tax audits and disputes with many tax authorities. In connection with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project, companies are required to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in other countries. The Company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of its tax audits and disputes to determine the appropriateness of its tax reserves. However, any tax authority could take a position on tax treatment that is contrary to the Company’s expectations, which could result in tax liabilities in excess of reserves. The Company may not be able to successfully secure and defend intellectual property rights essential to the Company’s businesses. The Company owns or licenses a significant number of patents and other proprietary rights, determined by patent offices, courts and lawmakers in various countries, relating to its products and manufacturing processes. These rights are essential to the Company’s businesses and materially important to the Company’s results of operations. Public policy, both within and outside the U.S., has become increasingly unfavorable toward intellectual property rights. The Company cannot be certain that it will obtain adequate patent protection for new products and technologies in the U.S. and other important markets or that such protections, once granted, will last as long as originally anticipated. Competitors routinely challenge the validity or extent of the Company’s owned or licensed patents and proprietary rights through litigation, interferences, oppositions and other proceedings. These proceedings absorb resources and can be protracted as well as unpredictable. In addition, challenges that the Company’s products infringe the patents of third parties could result in the need to pay past damages and future royalties and adversely affect the competitive position and sales of the products in question. The Company has faced increasing patent challenges from third parties seeking to manufacture and market generic and biosimilar versions of the Company's key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. In the U.S., manufacturers of generic versions of innovative human pharmaceutical products may challenge the validity, or claim non-infringement, of innovator products through the Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, process with the FDA. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA), enacted in 2010, which created a new regulatory pathway for the approval by the FDA of biosimilar alternatives to innovator-developed biological products, also created mechanisms for biosimilar applicants to challenge the patents on the innovator biologics. The inter partes review (IPR) process with the USPTO, created under the 2011 America Invents Act, is also being used by competitors to challenge patents held by the Company’s subsidiaries. In the event the Company is not successful in defending its patents against such challenges, or upon the “at-risk” launch (despite pending patent infringement litigation) by the generic or biosimilar firm of its product, the Company can lose a major portion of revenues for the referenced product in a very short period of time. Current legal proceedings involving the Company’s patents and other intellectual property rights are described in Note 21, “Legal Proceedings—Intellectual Property” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. The Company’s businesses operate in highly competitive product markets and competitive pressures could adversely affect the Company’s earnings. The Company faces substantial competition in all three operating segments and in all geographic markets. The Company’s businesses compete with companies of all sizes on the basis of cost-effectiveness, technological innovations, intellectual property rights, product performance, real or perceived product advantages, pricing and availability and rate of reimbursement. The Company also competes with other market participants in securing rights to acquisitions, collaborations and licensing agreements with third parties. Competition for rights to product candidates and technologies may result in significant investment and acquisition costs and onerous agreement terms for the Company. Competitors’ development of more effective or 6 less costly products, and/or their ability to secure patent and other intellectual property rights and successfully market products ahead of the Company, could negatively impact sales of the Company’s existing products as well as its ability to bring new products to market despite significant prior investment in the related product development. For the Company’s pharmaceutical businesses, loss of patent exclusivity for a product often is followed by a substantial reduction in sales as competitors gain regulatory approval for generic and other competing products and enter the market. Similar competition can be triggered by the loss of exclusivity for a biological product. For the Company’s medical device businesses, technological innovation, product quality, reputation and customer service are especially important to competitiveness. Development by other companies of new or improved products, processes and technologies could threaten to make the Company’s products or technologies less desirable, less economical or obsolete. The Company’s consumer businesses face intense competition from other branded products and retailers’ private-label brands. If the Company fails to sufficiently differentiate and market its brand name consumer products, this could adversely affect revenues and profitability of those products. Significant challenges or delays in the Company’s innovation and development of new products, technologies and indications could have an adverse impact on the Company’s long-term success. The Company’s continued growth and success depends on its ability to innovate and develop new and differentiated products and services that address the evolving health care needs of patients, providers and consumers. Development of successful products and technologies is also necessary to offset revenue losses when the Company’s existing products lose market share due to various factors such as competition and loss of patent exclusivity. New products introduced within the past five years accounted for approximately 25% of 2018 sales. The Company cannot be certain when or whether it will be able to develop, license or otherwise acquire companies, products and technologies, whether particular product candidates will be granted regulatory approval, and, if approved, whether the products will be commercially successful. The Company pursues product development through internal research and development as well as through collaborations, acquisitions, joint ventures and licensing or other arrangements with third parties. In all of these contexts, developing new products, particularly pharmaceutical and biotechnology products and medical devices, requires significant investment of resources over many years. Only a very few biopharmaceutical research and development programs result in commercially viable products. The process depends on many factors including the ability to discern patients’ and health care providers’ future needs; develop promising new compounds, strategies and technologies; achieve successful clinical trial results; secure effective intellectual property protection; obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis; and, if and when they reach the market, successfully differentiate the Company’s products from competing products and approaches to treatment. New products or enhancements to existing products may not be accepted quickly or significantly in the marketplace due to product and price competition, changes in customer preferences or healthcare purchasing patterns, resistance by healthcare providers or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. Even following initial regulatory approval, the success of a product can be adversely impacted by safety and efficacy findings in larger real world patient populations, as well as market entry of competitive products. The Company faces increasing regulatory scrutiny which imposes significant compliance costs and exposes the Company to government investigations, legal actions and penalties. Like other companies in the healthcare industry, the Company is subject to extensive regulation, investigations and legal action, by national, state and local government agencies in the U.S. and other countries in which they operate. Regulatory issues regarding compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) (and comparable quality regulations in foreign countries) by manufacturers of drugs, devices and consumer products can lead to fines and penalties, product recalls, product shortages, interruptions in production, delays in new product approvals and litigation. In addition, the marketing, pricing and sale of the Company’s products are subject to regulation, investigations and legal actions including under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Medicaid Rebate Program, federal and state false claims acts, state unfair trade practices acts and consumer protection laws. Increased scrutiny of health care industry business practices in recent years by government agencies and state attorneys general in the U.S., and any resulting investigations and prosecutions, carry risk of significant civil and criminal penalties including, but not limited to, debarment from participation in government healthcare programs. Any such debarment could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations. The most significant current investigations and litigation brought by government agencies are described in Note 21, “Legal Proceedings-Government Proceedings” under Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. The Company faces a variety of risks associated with conducting business internationally. The Company’s extensive operations and business activity outside the U.S. are accompanied by certain financial, economic and political risks, including those listed below. 7 Foreign Currency Exchange : In fiscal 2018, approximately 49% of the Company’s sales occurred outside of the U.S., with approximately 23% in Europe, 8% in the Western Hemisphere, excluding the U.S., and 18% in the Asia-Pacific and Africa region. Changes in non-U.S. currencies relative to the U.S. dollar impact the Company’s revenues and expenses. While the Company uses financial instruments to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on its cash flows, unhedged exposures continue to be subject to currency fluctuations. In addition, the weakening or strengthening of the U.S. dollar may result in significant favorable or unfavorable translation effects when the operating results of the Company’s non-U.S. business activity are translated into U.S. dollars. Inflation and Currency Devaluation Risks : The Company faces challenges in maintaining profitability of operations in economies experiencing high inflation rates. The Company has accounted for operations in Argentina (beginning in the fiscal third quarter of 2018) and Venezuela as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. While the Company strives to maintain profit margins in these areas through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price increases, it might experience operating losses as a result of continued inflation. In addition, the impact of currency devaluations in countries experiencing high inflation rates or significant currency exchange fluctuations could negatively impact the Company’s operating results. Illegal Importation of Pharmaceutical Products : The illegal importation of pharmaceutical products from countries where government price controls or other market dynamics result in lower prices may adversely affect the Company’s sales and profitability in the U.S. and other countries in which the Company operates. With the exception of limited quantities of prescription drugs for personal use, foreign imports of pharmaceutical products are illegal under current U.S. law. However, the volume of illegal imports continues to rise as the ability of patients and other customers to obtain the lower-priced imports has grown significantly. Anti-Bribery and Other Regulations: The Company is subject to various federal and foreign laws that govern its international business practices with respect to payments to government officials. Those laws include the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which prohibits U.S. publicly traded companies from promising, offering, or giving anything of value to foreign officials with the corrupt intent of influencing the foreign official for the purpose of helping the Company obtain or retain business or gain any improper advantage. The Company’s business is heavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with foreign officials. Also, in many countries outside the U.S., the health care providers who prescribe human pharmaceuticals are employed by the government and the purchasers of human pharmaceuticals are government entities; therefore, the Company’s interactions with these prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the FCPA. In addition to the U.S. application and enforcement of the FCPA, various jurisdictions in which the Company operates have laws and regulations, including the U.K Bribery Act 2010, aimed at preventing and penalizing corrupt and anticompetitive behavior. Enforcement activities under these laws could subject the Company to additional administrative and legal proceedings and actions, which could include claims for civil penalties, criminal sanctions, and administrative remedies, including exclusion from health care programs. Other Legal, Social and Political Risks . Other risks inherent in conducting business globally include: • protective economic policies taken by governments such as trade protection measures and import/export licensing requirements; • compliance with local regulations and laws including, in some countries, regulatory requirements restricting the Company’s ability to manufacture or sell its products in the relevant market; • diminished protection of intellectual property and contractual rights in certain jurisdictions; • potential nationalization or expropriation of the Company’s foreign assets; and • disruptions to markets due to war, armed conflict, terrorism, social upheavals or pandemics. Interruptions and delays in manufacturing operations could adversely affect the Company’s business, sales and reputation. The Company’s manufacture of products requires the timely delivery of sufficient amounts of complex, high-quality components and materials. The Company's subsidiaries operate 111 manufacturing facilities as well as sourcing from hundreds of suppliers around the world. The Company has in the past, and may in the future, face unanticipated interruptions and delays in manufacturing through its internal or external supply chain. Manufacturing disruptions can occur for many reasons including regulatory action, production quality deviations or safety issues, labor disputes, site-specific incidents (such as fires), natural disasters such as hurricanes and other severe weather events, raw material shortages, political unrest and terrorist attacks. Such delays and difficulties in manufacturing can result in product shortages, declines in sales and reputational impact as well as significant remediation and related costs associated with addressing the shortage. 8 The Company relies on third parties to manufacture certain of our products. Any failure by or loss of a third party manufacturer could result in delays and increased costs, which may adversely affect our business. The Company relies on third parties to manufacture certain of our products. We depend on these third party manufacturers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis and at acceptable prices. However, we cannot guarantee that these third party manufacturers will be able to meet our near-term or long-term manufacturing requirements, which could result in lost sales and have an adverse effect on our business. Other risks associated with our reliance on third parties to manufacture these products include, reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance, misappropriation of the Company’s intellectual property, limited ability to manage our inventory, possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party and the possible termination or nonrenewal of the manufacturing agreement by the third party at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us. Moreover, if any of our third party manufacturers suffer any damage to facilities, lose benefits under material agreements, experience power outages, encounter financial difficulties, are unable to secure necessary raw materials from their suppliers or suffer any other reduction in efficiency, the Company may experience significant business disruption. In the event of any such disruption, the Company would need to seek and source other qualified third party manufacturers, likely resulting in further delays and increased costs which could affect our business adversely. An information security incident, including a cybersecurity breach, could have a negative impact to the Company’s business or reputation To meet business objectives, the Company relies on both internal information technology (IT) systems and networks, and those of third parties and their vendors, to process and store sensitive data, including confidential research, business plans, financial information, intellectual property, and personal data that may be subject to legal protection. The extensive information security and cybersecurity threats, which affect companies globally, pose a risk to the security and availability of these IT systems and networks, and the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the Company’s sensitive data. The Company continually assesses these threats and makes investments to increase internal protection, detection, and response capabilities, as well as ensure the Company’s third party providers have required capabilities and controls, to address this risk . To date, the Company has not experienced any material impact to the business or operations resulting from information or cybersecurity attacks; however, because of the frequently changing attack techniques, along with the increased volume and sophistication of the attacks, there is the potential for the Company to be adversely impacted. This impact could result in reputational, competitive, operational or other business harm as well as financial costs and regulatory action. The Company maintains cybersecurity insurance in the event of an information security or cyber incident, however, the coverage may not be sufficient to cover all financial losses. 9 Item 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS Not applicable. Item 2. PROPERTIES The Company's subsidiaries operate 111 manufacturing facilities occupying approximately 20.5 million square feet of floor space. The manufacturing facilities are used by the industry segments of the Company’s business approximately as follows: Segment Square Feet (in thousands) Consumer 6,503 Pharmaceutical 6,819 Medical Devices 7,183 Worldwide Total 20,505 Within the U.S., five facilities are used by the Consumer segment, five by the Pharmaceutical segment and 27 by the Medical Devices segment.

Office and warehouse facilities are often leased. The Company also engages contract manufacturers. The Company is committed to maintaining all of its properties in good operating condition. McNEIL-PPC, Inc. (now Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc.) (McNEIL-PPC) continues to operate under a consent decree, signed in 2011 with the FDA, which governs certain McNeil Consumer Healthcare manufacturing operations, and requires McNEIL-PPC to remediate the facilities it operates in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, Fort Washington, Pennsylvania, and Las Piedras, Puerto Rico (the ""Consent Decree""). Following FDA inspections in 2015, McNEIL-PPC received notifications from the FDA that all three manufacturing facilities are in conformity with applicable laws and regulations, and commercial production has restarted. Under the Consent Decree, after receiving notice from the FDA of being in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, each of the three facilities is subject to a five-year audit period by a third-party cGMP expert. Thus, a third-party expert will continue to reassess the sites at various times until at least 2020. For information regarding lease obligations, see Note 16 “Rental Expense and Lease Commitments” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION Organization and Business Segments Description of the Company and Business Segments Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 135,100 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the health care field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world with the primary focus on products related to human health and well-being. The Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. The Consumer segment includes a broad range of products used in the baby care, oral care, beauty, over-the-counter pharmaceutical, women’s health and wound care markets. These products are marketed to the general public and sold both to retail outlets and distributors throughout the world. The Pharmaceutical segment is focused on six therapeutic areas, including immunology, infectious diseases, neuroscience, oncology, pulmonary hypertension, and cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Products in this segment are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers, hospitals and health care professionals for prescription use. The Medical Devices segment includes a broad range of products used in the orthopaedic, surgery, interventional solutions (cardiovascular and neurovascular), diabetes care (divested in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2018) and vision fields which are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics. The Executive Committee of Johnson & Johnson is the principal management group responsible for the strategic operations and allocation of the resources of the Company. This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities of the Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices business segments. In all of its product lines, the Company competes with companies both locally and globally, throughout the world. Competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved. Competition in research, involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. The development of new and innovative products, as well as protecting the underlying intellectual property of the Company's product portfolio, is important to the Company’s success in all areas of its business. The competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research. In addition, the development and maintenance of customer demand for the Company’s consumer products involves significant expenditures for advertising and promotion. Management’s Objectives With “Our Credo” as the foundation, the Company’s purpose is to blend heart, science and ingenuity to profoundly change the trajectory of health for humanity. The Company is committed to bringing its full breadth and depth to ensure health for people today and for future generations. United around this common ambition, the Company is poised to fulfill its purpose and successfully meet the demands of the rapidly evolving markets in which it competes. The Company is broadly based in human healthcare, and is committed to creating value by developing accessible, high quality, innovative products and services. New products introduced within the past five years accounted for approximately 25% of 2018 sales. In 2018, $10.8 billion was invested in research and development and $0.9 billion spent on acquisitions, reflecting management’s commitment to create life-enhancing innovations and to create value through partnerships that will profoundly change the trajectory of health for humanity. A critical driver of the Company’s success, is the 135,100 diverse employees that work across more than 260 operating companies, which are located in more than 60 countries. Employees are empowered and inspired to lead with the Company’s Our Credo and purpose as guides. This allows every employee to use the Company’s reach and size to advance the Company's purpose, and to also lead with agility and urgency. Leveraging the extensive resources across the enterprise, enables the Company to innovate and execute with excellence. This ensures the Company can remain focused on addressing the unmet needs of society every day and invest for an enduring impact, ultimately delivering value to its patients, consumers and healthcare professionals, employees, communities and shareholders. 16 Results of Operations Analysis of Consolidated Sales In 2018, worldwide sales increased 6.7% to $81.6 billion, compared to an increases of 6.3% and 2.6% in 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Growth was primarily driven by NEUTROGENA ® , OGX ® and AVEENO ® products as well as strength of DR. CI: LABO and DABAO ® products outside the U.S. Growth was partially offset by the divestiture of NIZORAL ® . The Over-the-Counter (OTC) franchise sales of $4.3 billion increased 5.0% as compared to the prior year. Growth was primarily driven by share, consumption and market growth across multiple brands including ZYRTEC ® , TYLENOL ® and Children's MOTRIN ® , as well as digestive health products and anti-smoking aids. Additionally, sales from the recent U.S. acquisition of Zarbee's Inc. contributed approximately 0.9% to growth. The Baby Care franchise sales were $1.9 billion in 2018, a decrease of 3.0% compared to the prior year, primarily due to JOHNSON's ® share decline and increased trade promotions due to the JOHNSON's ® baby relaunch and the negative impact of currency. This was partially offset by strong growth of AVEENO ® baby driven by geographic expansion. The Oral Care franchise sales of $1.6 billion increased 1.6% as compared to the prior year, primarily driven by strong marketing campaigns and new product launches. The Women’s Health franchise sales were $1.0 billion in 2018, a decrease of 0.1% as compared to the prior year. Growth in Latin America was offset by the negative impact of currency. The Wound Care/Other franchise sales were $0.7 billion in 2018, a decrease of 13.4% as compared to the prior year, primarily due to the divestiture of COMPEED ® . Consumer segment sales in 2017 were $13.6 billion, an increase of 2.2% from 2016, which included 1.3% operational growth and a positive currency impact of 0.9%. U.S. Consumer segment sales were $5.6 billion, an increase of 2.7%. International sales were $8.0 billion, an increase of 1.9%, which included 0.4% operational growth and a positive currency impact of 1.5%.

Growth was driven by strong uptake of STELARA ® (ustekinumab) in Crohn's disease, strong launch uptake of TREMFYA ® (guselkumab), expanded indications of SIMPONI ® /SIMPONI ARIA ® (golimumab), and the U.S. immunology market growth. Immunology was negatively impacted by lower sales of REMICADE ® (infliximab) due to increased discounts/rebates and biosimilar competition. The patents for REMICADE ® (infliximab) in certain countries in Europe expired in February 2015. Biosimilar versions of REMICADE ® have been introduced in certain markets outside the U.S., resulting in a reduction in sales of REMICADE ® in those markets. Additional biosimilar competition will likely result in a further reduction in REMICADE ® sales in markets outside the United States. In the U.S., a biosimilar version of REMICADE ® was introduced in 2016, and additional competitors continue to enter the market. Continued infliximab biosimilar competition in the U.S. market will result in a further reduction in U.S. sales of REMICADE ® . See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of legal matters regarding the REMICADE ® patents. Infectious disease products sales were $3.3 billion in 2018, representing an increase of 4.8% as compared to the prior year. Sales growth of PREZCOBIX ® /REZOLSTA ® (darunavir/cobicistat), EDURANT ® /rilpivirine, and the launch of SYMTUZA ® and JULUCA ® (dolutegravir/rilpivirine) was partially offset by lower sales of PREZISTA ® (darunavir). Neuroscience products sales were $6.1 billion, representing an increase of 1.5% as compared to the prior year. Strong sales of long-acting injectables INVEGA TRINZA ® /TREVICTA ® (paliperidone palmitate) and INVEGA SUSTENNA ® /XEPLION ® were partially offset by cannibalization of RISPERDAL CONSTA ® (risperidone) and generic competition for CONCERTA ® /methylphenidate. Oncology products achieved sales of $9.8 billion in 2018, representing an increase of 35.6% as compared to the prior year. Contributors to the growth were strong sales of DARZALEX ® (daratumumab) with continued market growth and share gain, IMBRUVICA ® (ibrutinib) due to increased patient uptake globally and sales of ZYTIGA ® (abiraterone acetate) driven by LATITUDE data and market growth. Additionally, sales from the launch of ERLEADA™ (apalutamide) contributed to the growth. A number of companies marketing generic pharmaceuticals have filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) with the FDA, or undertaken similar regulatory processes outside of the U.S., seeking to market generic forms of ZYTIGA ® prior to expiration of its applicable patents. These ANDAs include allegations of non-infringement and invalidity of the applicable patents. In October 2018, the Court issued a ruling invalidating all asserted claims of the applicable patent. Janssen has appealed the Court’s decision. In November 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit denied Janssen’s request for an injunction pending appeal. As a result, several generic versions of ZYTIGA ® have entered the market, resulting in a decline in sales of ZYTIGA ® in the United States. In 2018, the Company reported U.S. sales of $1.8 billion for ZYTIGA ® . See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of legal matters regarding ZYTIGA ® . The Pulmonary Hypertension therapeutic area was established with the acquisition of Actelion Ltd on June 16, 2017. Sales in 2018 represented a full year as compared to half a year in 2017. Sales of OPSUMIT ® (macitentan) and UPTRAVI ® (selexipag) were positively impacted by market growth and share gains while sales of TRACLEER ® (bosetan) were negatively impacted by increased use of OPSUMIT ® and generics. Cardiovascular/Metabolism/Other products sales were $5.8 billion, a decline of 7.5% as compared to the prior year. Lower sales of INVOKANA ® /INVOKAMET ® (canagliflozin) in the U.S. was primarily due to an increase in price discounts, higher rebates and market share decline driven by competitive pressure. Lower sales of XARELTO ® (rivaroxaban) were driven by an increase in discounts and rebates, partially offset by an increase in market share. 20 During 2018, the Company advanced its pipeline with several regulatory submissions and approvals for new drugs and additional indications for existing drugs as follows: Product Name (Chemical Name) Indication US Approval EU Approval US Filing EU Filing DARZALEX ® (daratumumab) Frontline multiple myeloma transplant ineligible patients in combination with bortezomib, melphalan, and prednisone   erdafitinib Treatment of locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer  ERLEADA™ (apalutamide) Treatment of non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer   esketamine Antidepressant for treatment-resistant depression in adults   IMBRUVICA ® (ibrutinib) Treatment of Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia used in combination with rituximab   Treatment for previously untreated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia in combination with obinutuzumab   INVOKANA ® (canagliflozin) Reduce the risk of death in type 2 diabetes with established, or risk for, cardiovascular disease.

Growth in Advanced Surgery was primarily driven by endocutter, biosurgery and energy products. Growth in General Surgery was primarily driven by wound care products. Growth in Specialty Surgery was primarily driven by Advanced Sterilization Products. The Orthopaedics franchise sales were $8.9 billion in 2018, a decrease of 1.9% from 2017. The decline in Spine & Other was primarily due to the Codman Neurosurgery divestiture and share loss in Spine partially offset by new product launches. The decline in knees was primarily due to competitive pressure in the U.S. partially offset by growth in Asia Pacific. Growth in hips and trauma was due to continued uptake of new products. The Vision franchise achieved sales of $4.6 billion in 2018, an increase of 12.1% from 2017. Growth was primarily driven by strength of the astigmatism and daily disposable lenses in the OASYS ® contact lenses category. Surgical growth was driven by cataract performance primarily outside the U.S. The Interventional Solutions franchise (includes the Cerenovus business previously included in Spine and Other in Orthopaedics) sales were $2.6 billion, an increase of 15.2% from 2017. Strong growth in the electrophysiology business was driven by Atrial Fibrillation procedure growth and continued uptake of the THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH ® Contact Force Sensing Catheter. The Diabetes Care franchise sales were $1.0 billion, a decrease of 37.5% from 2017. The decline was primarily due to divestiture of its LifeScan business in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2018 and the Company's decision to exit the Animas insulin pump business in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2017. The Medical Devices segment sales in 2017 were $26.6 billion, an increase of 5.9% from 2016, which included an operational increase of 5.7% and a positive currency impact of 0.2%. U.S. sales were $12.8 billion, an increase of 4.5% as compared to the prior year. International sales were $13.8 billion, an increase of 7.1% as compared to the prior year, with an 22 operational increase of 6.7% and a positive currency impact of 0.4%. In 2017, acquisitions and divestitures had a net positive impact of 4.2% on the worldwide operational sales growth of the Medical Devices segment as compared to 2016. Analysis of Consolidated Earnings Before Provision for Taxes on Income Consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income was $18.0 billion, $17.7 billion and $19.8 billion for the fiscal years ended 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. As a percent to sales, consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income was 22.1%, 23.1%, and 27.5% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Cost of Products Sold and Selling, Marketing and Administrative Expenses: Cost of products sold and selling, marketing and administrative expenses as a percent to sales were as follows:* % of Sales 2018 2017 2016 Cost of products sold* 33.2 % 33.3 30.3 Percent point increase/(decrease) over the prior year (0.1 ) 3.0 (0.3 ) Selling, marketing and administrative expenses* 27.6 % 28.1 27.9 Percent point increase/(decrease) over the prior year (0.5 ) 0.2 (2.2 ) *Prior years amounts were reclassified to conform to current year presentation (adoption of ASU 2017-07) In 2018, cost of products sold as a percent to sales decreased to 33.2% from 33.3% as compared to the same period a year ago primarily due to lower inventory step-up costs related to the Actelion acquisition and favorable product and segment mix driven by a higher percentage of sales from the Pharmaceutical segment. This was mostly offset by higher amortization expense primarily related to the Actelion acquisition on June 16, 2017. Intangible asset amortization expense of $4.4 billion was included in cost of products sold for 2018 as compared to $3.0 billion in 2017. There was a decrease in the percent to sales of selling, marketing and administrative expenses in 2018 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to lower costs relative to sales growth in the Pharmaceutical business and favorable segment mix. In 2017, cost of products sold as a percent to sales increased to 33.3% from 30.3% as compared to the same period a year ago. The unfavorable increase was primarily driven by $2.3 billion of higher amortization expense and charges for inventory step-up related to the recent acquisitions, primarily Actelion. Intangible asset amortization expense of $3.0 billion was included in cost of products sold for 2017 as compared to $1.2 billion in 2016. There was an increase in the percent to sales of selling, marketing and administrative expenses in 2017 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to investments in new product launches partially offset by favorable mix. 23 Research and Development Expense: Research and development expense by segment of business was as follows:* 2018 2017 2016 (Dollars in Millions) Amount % of Sales** Amount % of Sales** Amount % of Sales** Consumer $ 565 4.1 % 586 4.3 585 4.4 Pharmaceutical 8,446 20.7 8,392 23.1 7,001 20.9 Medical Devices 1,764 6.5 1,616 6.1 1,557 6.2 Total research and development expense $ 10,775 13.2 % 10,594 13.9 9,143 12.7 Percent increase/(decrease) over the prior year 1.7 % 15.9 1.6 *Prior years amounts were reclassified to conform to current year presentation (adoption of ASU 2017-07) **As a percent to segment sales Research and development activities represent a significant part of the Company's business. These expenditures relate to the processes of discovering, testing and developing new products, upfront payments and milestones, improving existing products, as well as ensuring product efficacy and regulatory compliance prior to launch. The Company remains committed to investing in research and development with the aim of delivering high quality and innovative products. In 2018, worldwide costs of research and development activities increased by 1.7% compared to 2017 but decreased as a percent of sales. The decrease as a percent of sales in the Pharmaceutical segment was attributable to lower costs relative to sales growth. The increased dollar spend in the Medical Devices and Pharmaceutical segments was for investment spending to advance the pipeline. In 2017, worldwide costs of research and development activities increased by 15.9% compared to 2016. The increase as a percent of sales was primarily in the Pharmaceutical segment due to general portfolio progression as well as collaborative agreements entered into with Idorsia Ltd. and Legend Biotech. Research facilities are located in the U.S., Belgium, Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Israel, the Netherlands, Poland, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom with additional R&D support in over 30 other countries. In-Process Research and Development (IPR&D): In 2018, the Company recorded an IPR&D charge of $1.1 billion. Of the $1.1 billion, a partial impairment charge of $0.8 billion related to the development program of AL-8176, an investigational drug for the treatment of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) acquired with the 2014 acquisition of Alios Biopharma Inc. The impairment charge was calculated based on updated cash flow projections discounted for the inherent risk in the asset development and reflects the impact of the phase 2b clinical trial suspension, a decrease in the probability of success factors and the ongoing analysis of asset development activities. The Company continues to evaluate information with respect to the development program and will monitor the remaining $0.9 billion intangible asset for further impairment. In addition, an impairment charge of $0.3 billion was recorded for the discontinuation of the development project for an anti-thrombin antibody associated with the 2015 acquisition of XO1 Limited. In 2017, the Company recorded an IPR&D charge of $0.4 billion primarily for the discontinuation of certain development projects related to Novira which was acquired in 2015. The product development was canceled due to safety concerns. In 2016, the Company recorded an IPR&D charge of $29 million for the discontinuation of a development program related to Crucell. Other (Income) Expense, Net: Other (income) expense, net is the account where the Company records gains and losses related to the sale and write-down of certain investments in equity securities held by Johnson & Johnson Innovation - JJDC, Inc. (JJDC), unrealized gains and losses on investments, gains and losses on divestitures, certain transactional currency gains and losses, acquisition-related costs, litigation accruals and settlements, as well as royalty income. The change in other (income) expense, net for the fiscal year 2018 was an unfavorable change of $1.4 billion primarily due to litigation expense of $2.0 billion in 2018 as compared to $1.3 billion in 2017. Additionally, 2018 included unrealized losses on securities of $0.2 billion and lower realized gains of $0.4 billion related to investments in equity securities as compared to the prior year. This was partially offset by a reversal of a contingent liability of $0.2 billion and lower costs of $0.1 billion related to the Actelion and AMO acquisitions in 2018 as compared to 2017. The fiscal year of 2017 included a gain of $0.2 billion related to monetization of future royalty receivables offset by an asset impairment charge of $0.2 billion primarily related to the insulin pump business. Divestiture gains were approximately $1.2 billion in 2018 and included the LifeScan business, NIZORAL ® , RoC ® and certain non-strategic Pharmaceutical products. Divestiture gains were approximately $1.3 billion in 2017 and primarily included the Codman Neurosurgery and COMPEED ® divestitures. Additionally, restructuring related expense in 2018 was $0.3 billion as compared to $0.4 billion 2017. The change in other (income) expense, net for the fiscal year 2017 was a favorable change of $0.3 billion due to higher gains of $0.7 billion on the sale of assets/businesses, primarily the Codman Neurosurgery and COMPEED ® divestitures, a gain of $0.2 billion related to monetization of future royalty receivables and a higher gain of $0.3 billion related to the sale of certain investments in equity securities as compared to the prior year. This was partially offset by higher litigation expense of $0.4 billion, $0.3 billion of acquisition costs related to Actelion and AMO, an asset impairment charge of $0.2 billion primarily 24 related to the insulin pump business and a higher restructuring related charge of $0.2 billion as compared to the fiscal year 2016. Interest (Income) Expense: Interest income was higher in 2018 as compared to 2017 due to a higher average interest rate and a benefit from net investment hedging partially offset by a lower average cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance during the period. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $19.7 billion at the end of 2018, and averaged $19.0 billion as compared to the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities total of $18.3 billion and $30.1 billion average cash balance in 2017. The decrease in the average balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was due to the use of cash for general corporate purposes, primarily the Actelion acquisition for $29.6 billion, net of cash acquired late in the fiscal second quarter of 2017. Interest expense in 2018 was higher as compared to 2017 due to a higher average debt balance. The average debt balance was $32.5 billion in 2018 versus $30.9 billion in 2017. The total debt balance at the end of 2018 was $30.5 billion as compared to $34.6 billion at the end of 2017. Interest income in 2017 increased slightly as compared to 2016 due to higher average interest rates partially offset by lower cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances during the period. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $18.3 billion at the end of 2017, and averaged $30.1 billion as compared to the $40.1 billion average cash balance in 2016. The decrease in the balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was due to the use of cash for general corporate purposes including acquisitions, primarily the Actelion acquisition for $29.6 billion, net of cash acquired. Interest expense in 2017 was higher as compared to 2016. The average debt balance was $30.9 billion in 2017 versus $23.5 billion in 2016. The total debt balance at the end of 2017 was $34.6 billion as compared to $27.1 billion at the end of 2016. The higher debt balance of approximately $7.5 billion was primarily due to increased borrowings. The Company increased borrowings in February and November of 2017, capitalizing on favorable terms in the capital markets. The proceeds of the borrowings were used for general corporate purposes, including the completion of the stock repurchase program. Income Before Tax by Segment Income before tax by segment of business were as follows: Income Before Tax Segment Sales Percent of Segment Sales (Dollars in Millions) 2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 2017 Consumer $ 2,320 2,524 13,853 13,602 16.7 % 18.6 Pharmaceutical 12,568 11,083 40,734 36,256 30.9 30.6 Medical Devices 4,397 5,392 26,994 26,592 16.3 20.3 Total (1) 19,285 18,999 81,581 76,450 23.6 24.9 Less: Expenses not allocated to segments (2) 1,286 1,326 Earnings before provision for taxes on income $ 17,999 17,673 81,581 76,450 22.1 % 23.1 (1) See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details. (2) Amounts not allocated to segments include interest (income) expense and general corporate (income) expense. Consumer Segment: In 2018, the Consumer segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 16.7%, versus 18.6% in 2017. The decrease in the income before tax as a percent of sales in 2018 as compared to 2017 was primarily attributable to higher litigation expense of $0.3 billion in 2018 partially offset by slower increases in expenses relative to the increase in sales. Divestiture gains for the fiscal year of 2018, which included the divestitures of NIZORAL ® and RoC ® were comparable to fiscal year of 2017. A gain of $0.3 billion was recognized from the divestiture of NIZORAL ® . In 2017, the Consumer segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 18.6%, versus 18.3% in 2016. The increase in the income before tax as a percent of sales in 2017 as compared to 2016 was attributable to higher gains on divestitures, primarily the divestiture of COMPEED ® in 2017. This was partially offset by higher selling, marketing and administrative expenses as compared to the prior year due to increased advertising and promotional spending and slightly higher amortization expense in 2017 related to acquisitions. Additionally, the fiscal year 2016 was negatively impacted by operations in Venezuela. Pharmaceutical Segment: In 2018, the Pharmaceutical segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 30.9% versus 30.6% in 2017. The increase in the income before tax as a percent of sales was primarily due to lower inventory step-up costs related to Actelion of $0.6 billion, favorable product mix and slower increases in expenses relative to the increase in sales, a contingent liability reversal of $0.2 billion and higher divestiture gains of $0.2 billion from divestitures of certain non-strategic Pharmaceutical products. This was partially offset by higher amortization expense of $1.3 billion primarily related to the Actelion acquisition, a higher IPR&D charge of $0.7 billion and an unrealized loss on securities of $0.2 billion as compared to 25 the prior year. Additionally, 2017 included a gain of $0.2 billion related to monetization of future royalty receivables and a higher gain of $0.3 billion related to the sale of certain investments in equity securities. In 2017, the Pharmaceutical segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 30.6% versus 38.3% in 2016. The decrease in the income before tax as a percent of sales was primarily due to $2.3 billion of higher amortization expense and other costs related to the Actelion acquisition, higher research and development expense, a higher IPR&D charge of $0.4 billion related to Novira and lower gains on divestitures as compared to the prior year. Additionally, the fiscal year 2016 included a positive adjustment of $0.5 billion to previous reserve estimates. This was partially offset by a gain of $0.2 billion related to monetization of future royalty receivables, a higher gain of $0.2 billion related to the sale of certain investments in equity securities and favorable product mix in 2017. Medical Devices Segment: In 2018, the Medical Devices segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 16.3% versus 20.3% in 2017. The decrease in the income before tax as a percent to sales was primarily due higher litigation expense of $1.7 billion in 2018 as compared to $1.1 billion in 2017 and higher investments in the business in 2018. Additionally, 2018 had lower divestiture gains of approximately $0.3 billion as compared to divestiture gains in 2017. In 2018 the Company recorded a gain of $0.5 billion related to the LifeScan divestiture. This was partially offset by lower restructuring expense of $0.2 billion in 2018 as compared to 2017. Additionally, 2017 included an asset impairment charge of $0.2 billion primarily related to the insulin pump business. In 2017, the Medical Devices segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 20.3% versus 22.2% in 2016. The decrease in the income before tax as a percent to sales was primarily due to $0.3 billion of higher amortization expense and other acquisition costs related to AMO, $0.3 billion of higher litigation, an asset impairment charge of $0.2 billion primarily related to the insulin pump business, $0.1 billion of higher restructuring and investments in new product launches as compared to the fiscal year 2016. This was partially offset by $0.8 billion higher gains in 2017 related to divestitures, primarily the divestiture of Codman Neurosurgery. Restructuring: In the first quarter of 2016, the Company announced restructuring actions in its Medical Devices segment. The Company has achieved approximately $0.7 billion of annualized pre-tax cost saving in 2018 and is on track to achieve the annualized pre-tax cost savings of $0.8 billion to $1.0 billion as outlined in the restructuring actions. The savings will provide the Company with added flexibility and resources to fund investment in new growth opportunities and innovative solutions for customers and patients. In 2018, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $462 million, of which $46 million is included in cost of products sold and $227 million is included in other (income) expense. Total project costs of approximately $2.5 billion have been recorded since the restructuring was announced. This restructuring program was completed in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2018. In the second quarter of 2018, the Company announced plans to implement actions across its global supply chain that are intended to enable the Company to focus resources and increase investments in critical capabilities, technologies and solutions necessary to manufacture and supply its product portfolio of the future, enhance agility and drive growth. The Company expects these supply chain actions will include expanding its use of strategic collaborations, and bolstering its initiatives to reduce complexity, improving cost-competitiveness, enhancing capabilities and optimizing its network. Discussions regarding specific future actions are ongoing and are subject to all relevant consultation requirements before they are finalized. In total, the Company expects these actions to generate approximately $0.6 to $0.8 billion in annual pre-tax cost savings that will be substantially delivered by 2022. The Company expects to record pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $1.9 to $2.3 billion. The Company estimates that approximately 70% of the cumulative pre-tax costs will result in cash outlays. In 2018, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $238 million, of which $59 million is included in cost of products sold and $117 million is included in other (income) expense. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the restructuring programs. Provision for Taxes on Income: The worldwide effective income tax rate was 15.0% in 2018 , 92.6% in 2017 and 16.5% in 2016 . The 2018 effective tax rate decreased by 77.6% as compared to 2017. The 2017 effective tax rate was primarily driven by a provisional tax charge of approximately $13.0 billion as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 and the impact of a Belgian statutory tax rate change which increased the 2017 effective rate by 3.4%. The Company also received a benefit in 2018 from a lower U.S. statutory tax rate vs. 2017 as well as favorable adjustments to the 2017 provisional TCJA tax charge partially offset by unfavorable income tax mix and the U.S. tax on global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI). The 2017 effective tax rate increased by 76.1% as compared to 2016, primarily driven by the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) in the United States in December 2017. The enactment of the TCJA resulted in a provisional tax charge in the fourth quarter of 2017, of approximately $13.0 billion or approximately 73.3 percentage point increase to the effective tax rate. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the TCJA. 26 The remainder of the increase in the tax rate for 2017 was related to the remeasurement of the Company’s deferred tax assets in Belgium, as a result of changes in the Belgian statutory corporate tax rate, enacted in December 2017, offset by a tax benefit for the closure of the Company’s Animas insulin pump business. The government in Switzerland is currently considering tax reform legislation, which could have a material impact on the Company’s effective tax rate if enacted into law. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the TCJA and income taxes. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity & Cash Flows Cash and cash equivalents were $18.1 billion at the end of 2018 as compared to $17.8 billion at the end of 2017. The primary sources and uses of cash that contributed to the $0.3 billion increase were approximately $22.2 billion of cash generated from operating activities. This was partially offset by $3.2 billion net cash used by investing activities, $18.5 billion net cash used by financing activities and $0.2 billion due to the effect on exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents. In addition, the Company had $1.6 billion in marketable securities at the end of 2018 and $0.5 billion at the end of 2017. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Cash flow from operations of $22.2 billion was the result of $15.3 billion of net earnings and $9.2 billion of non-cash expenses and other adjustments for depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation and assets write-downs, offset by $2.3 billion from net gains on sale of assets/businesses, deferred tax provision and accounts receivable allowances, $3.9 billion related to an increase in accounts receivable, inventories and other current and non-current assets and a decrease in other current and non-current liabilities. Additional sources of operating cash flow of $4.0 billion resulted from an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. The decrease in current and non-current liabilities is primarily due to the 2018 tax payment related to TCJA. Investing activities use of $3.2 billion was for additions to property, plant and equipment of $3.7 billion, the net purchase of investments primarily marketable securities of $1.3 billion, acquisitions, net of cash acquired of $0.9 billion (primarily the acquisitions of Zarbee's) and other uses of $0.5 billion. This was partially offset by $3.2 billion of proceeds from the disposal of assets/businesses (primarily the divestiture of LifeScan). Financing activities use of $18.5 billion was primarily for dividends to shareholders of $9.5 billion, $5.9 billion for the repurchase of common stock, $3.9 billion for the net retirement of short and long-term debt and $0.2 billion of other financing. Financing activities also included sources of $1.0 billion of proceeds from stock options exercised/employee withholding tax on stock awards, net. On December 17, 2018, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program, authorizing the Company to purchase up to $5.0 billion of the Company's shares of common stock. The repurchase program has no time limit and may be suspended for periods or discontinued at any time. Any shares acquired will be available for general corporate purposes. The Company intends to finance the share repurchase program through available cash. As of December 30, 2018, $0.9 billion has been repurchased under the program. As of December 30, 2018, the Company's notes payable and long-term debt was in excess of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. As of December 30, 2018, the net debt position was $10.8 billion as compared to the prior year of $16.3 billion. There was a decrease in the net debt position due to retirement of debt. The debt balance at the end of 2018 was $30.5 billion as compared to $34.6 billion in 2017. Additionally there was a higher cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance at the end of 2018. In 2018, the Company continued to have access to liquidity through the commercial paper market. Additionally, as a result of the TCJA, the Company has access to its cash outside the U.S. at a significantly reduced cost. The Company anticipates that operating cash flows, the ability to raise funds from external sources, borrowing capacity from existing committed credit facilities and access to the commercial paper markets will continue to provide sufficient resources to fund operating needs for the next twelve months. The Company monitors the global capital markets on an ongoing basis and from time to time may raise capital when market conditions are favorable. The Company filed a new shelf registration on February 27, 2017 which will enable it to issue debt securities on a timely basis. For additional details on borrowings, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Financing and Market Risk The Company uses financial instruments to manage the impact of foreign exchange rate changes on cash flows. Accordingly, the Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to protect the value of certain foreign currency assets and liabilities and to hedge future foreign currency transactions primarily related to product costs. Gains or losses on these contracts are offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions. A 10% appreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the December 30, 2018 market rates would increase the unrealized value of the Company’s forward contracts by $57 million. Conversely, a 10% depreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the December 30, 2018 market rates would decrease the unrealized value of the Company’s forward contracts by $69 million. In either scenario, the gain or loss on the forward contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated earnings and cash flows. 27 The Company hedges the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and the effect on certain assets and liabilities in foreign currency, by entering into currency swap contracts. A 1% change in the spread between U.S. and foreign interest rates on the Company’s interest rate sensitive financial instruments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of the Company’s swap contracts by approximately $226 million. In either scenario, at maturity, the gain or loss on the swap contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated cash flows. The Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Further, the Company has a policy of only entering into contracts with parties that have at least an investment grade credit rating. The counter-parties to these contracts are major financial institutions and there is no significant concentration of exposure with any one counter-party. Management believes the risk of loss is remote. During the fiscal second quarter of 2017, the Company entered into credit support agreements (CSA) with certain derivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on respective credit ratings and netting agreements. The Company invests in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities which carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. A 1% (100 basis points) change in spread on the Company’s interest rate sensitive investments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of cash equivalents and current marketable securities by approximately $8 million. The Company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous banks worldwide. In September 2018, the Company secured a new 364-day Credit Facility. Total credit available to the Company approximates $10 billion, which expires on September 12, 2019. Interest charged on borrowings under the credit line agreement is based on either bids provided by banks, the prime rate or London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR), plus applicable margins. Commitment fees under the agreement are not material. Total borrowings at the end of 2018 and 2017 were $30.5 billion and $34.6 billion, respectively. The decrease in borrowings was due to the retirement of debt in 2018. In 2018, net debt (cash and current marketable securities, net of debt) was $10.8 billion compared to net debt of $16.3 billion in 2017. Total debt represented 33.8% of total capital (shareholders’ equity and total debt) in 2018 and 36.5% of total capital in 2017. Shareholders’ equity per share at the end of 2018 was $22.44 compared to $22.43 at year-end 2017 . A summary of borrowings can be found in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Contractual Obligations and Commitments The Company’s contractual obligations are primarily for the recently enacted tax legislation, leases, debt and unfunded retirement plans. There are no other significant obligations. To satisfy these obligations, the Company will use cash from operations. The following table summarizes the Company’s contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as of December 30, 2018 (see Notes 7, 8, 10 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details): (Dollars in Millions) Tax Legislation (TCJA) Debt Obligations Interest on Debt Obligations Unfunded Retirement Plans Operating Leases Total 2019 $ — 2,636 949 92 223 3,900 2020 531 1,098 886 95 188 2,798 2021 812 1,796 841 101 154 3,704 2022 812 2,134 796 108 116 3,966 2023 1,522 1,553 764 115 76 4,030 After 2023 4,565 21,103 8,850 697 139 35,354 Total $ 8,242 30,320 13,086 1,208 896 53,752 For tax matters, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For other retirement plan and post-employment medical benefit information, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The table does not include activity related to business combinations. Dividends The Company increased its dividend in 2018 for the 56th consecutive year. Cash dividends paid were $3.54 per share in 2018 compared with dividends of $3.32 per share in 2017 , and $3.15 per share in 2016 . 28 Other Information Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are based on the Company’s consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and other related disclosures. Actual results may or may not differ from these estimates. The Company believes that the understanding of certain key accounting policies and estimates are essential in achieving more insight into the Company’s operating results and financial condition. These key accounting policies include revenue recognition, income taxes, legal and self-insurance contingencies, valuation of long-lived assets, assumptions used to determine the amounts recorded for pensions and other employee benefit plans and accounting for stock based awards. Revenue Recognition: The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the goods to customers. The Company's global payment terms are typically between 30 to 90 days. Provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns and discounts to customers are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Accounting Standards Update related to revenue which was adopted in 2018. Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants, as well as market conditions, including consideration of competitor pricing. Rebates are estimated based on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served. The Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through the analysis of wholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally generated information. Sales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals. Sales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in the field, or in specific areas, product recall. The sales returns reserve is based on historical return trends by product and by market as a percent to gross sales. In accordance with the Company’s accounting policies, the Company generally issues credit to customers for returned goods. The Company’s sales returns reserves are accounted for in accordance with the U.S. GAAP guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns reserves are recorded at full sales value. Sales returns in the Consumer and Pharmaceutical segments are almost exclusively not resalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the Medical Devices segment are typically resalable but are not material. The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products. The sales returns reserve for the total Company has been approximately 1.0% of annual net trade sales during the fiscal reporting years 2018 , 2017 and 2016 . Promotional programs, such as product listing allowances and cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in the same period as related sales. Continuing promotional programs include coupons and volume-based sales incentive programs. The redemption cost of consumer coupons is based on historical redemption experience by product and value. Volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales volumes for the incentive period and are recorded as products are sold. These arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred or recorded as a reduction of revenue. The Company also earns profit-share payments through collaborative arrangements of certain products, which are included in sales to customers. For all years presented, profit-share payments were less than 2.0% of the total revenues and are included in sales to customers. In addition, the Company enters into collaboration arrangements that contain multiple revenue generating activities. Amounts due from collaborative partners for these arrangements are recognized as each activity is performed or delivered, based on the relative selling price. Upfront fees received as part of these arrangements are deferred and recognized over the performance period. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures on collaborations. Reasonably likely changes to assumptions used to calculate the accruals for rebates, returns and promotions are not anticipated to have a material effect on the financial statements. The Company currently discloses the impact of changes to assumptions in the quarterly or annual filing in which there is a material financial statement impact. 29 Below are tables that show the progression of accrued rebates, returns, promotions, reserve for doubtful accounts and reserve for cash discounts by segment of business for the fiscal years ended December 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 .

Income Taxes: Income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and include the results of any difference between U.S. GAAP accounting and tax reporting, recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities. The Company estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on enacted tax regulations and rates. Future changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company follows U.S. GAAP, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Management believes that changes in these estimates would not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial position. The Company has recorded deferred tax liabilities on all undistributed earnings prior to December 31, 2017 from its international subsidiaries. The Company has not provided deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings subsequent to January 1, 2018 from certain international subsidiaries where the earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. The Company intends to continue to reinvest these earnings in those international operations. If the Company decides at a later date to repatriate these earnings to the U.S., the Company would be required to provide for the net tax effects on these amounts. The Company estimates that the total tax effect of this repatriation would be approximately $0.7 billion under current enacted tax laws and regulations and at current currency exchange rates. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding income taxes. Legal and Self Insurance Contingencies: The Company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal proceedings and product liability claims as these arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on management’s judgment as to the probability of losses and, where applicable, actuarially determined estimates. The Company has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals in the self insurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated. The Company follows the provisions of U.S. GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies. A liability is recorded when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. The best estimate of a loss within a range is accrued; however, if no estimate in the range is better than any other, the minimum amount is accrued. See Notes 1 and 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding product liability and legal proceedings. 31 Long-Lived and Intangible Assets: The Company assesses changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows in evaluating the value of the Company’s property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets. As these assumptions and estimates may change over time, it may or may not be necessary for the Company to record impairment charges. Employee Benefit Plans: The Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit, defined contribution and termination indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide. These plans are based on assumptions for the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, expected salary increases, health care cost trend rates and attrition rates. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on these rates and the effect a rate change to the health care cost trend would have on the Company’s results of operations. Stock Based Compensation: The Company recognizes compensation expense associated with the issuance of equity instruments to employees for their services. Based on the type of equity instrument, the fair value is estimated on the date of grant using either the Black-Scholes option valuation model or a combination of both the Black-Scholes option valuation model and Monte Carlo valuation model, and is expensed in the financial statements over the service period. The input assumptions used in determining fair value are the expected life, expected volatility, risk-free rate and expected dividend yield. For performance share units the fair market value is calculated for each of the three component goals at the date of grant. The fair values for the sales and earnings per share goals of each performance share unit were estimated on the date of grant using the fair market value of the shares at the time of the award, discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the performance share units during the vesting period. The fair value for the relative total shareholder return goal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo valuation model. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. New Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of December 30, 2018 . Economic and Market Factors The Company is aware that its products are used in an environment where, for more than a decade, policymakers, consumers and businesses have expressed concerns about the rising cost of health care. In response to these concerns, the Company has a long-standing policy of pricing products responsibly. For the period 2008 - 2018, in the U.S., the weighted average compound annual growth rate of the Company’s net price increases for health care products (prescription and over-the-counter drugs, hospital and professional products) was below the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI). The Company operates in certain countries where the economic conditions continue to present significant challenges. The Company continues to monitor these situations and take appropriate actions. Inflation rates continue to have an effect on worldwide economies and, consequently, on the way companies operate. The Company has accounted for operations in Argentina (beginning in the fiscal third quarter of 2018) and Venezuela as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. This did not have a material impact to the Company's results in the period. In the face of increasing costs, the Company strives to maintain its profit margins through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price increases. In June 2016, the United Kingdom (U.K.) held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union (E.U.), commonly referred to as “Brexit” and in March 2017 the U.K. formally started the process for the U.K. to leave the E.U. Given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what financial, trade, regulatory and legal implications the withdrawal of the U.K. from the E.U. will have. Brexit creates global political and economic uncertainty, which may cause, among other consequences, volatility in exchange rates and interest rates, additional cost containment by third-party payors and changes in regulations. However, the Company currently does not believe that these and other related effects will have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position or operating results. As of December 30, 2018, the business of the Company’s U.K. subsidiaries represented less than 3% of both the Company’s consolidated assets and fiscal twelve months revenues, respectively. The Company is exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. A 1% change in the value of the U.S. Dollar as compared to all foreign currencies in which the Company had sales, income or expense in 2018 would have increased or decreased the translation of foreign sales by approximately $390 million and net income by approximately $100 million. Governments around the world consider various proposals to make changes to tax laws, which may include increasing or decreasing existing statutory tax rates. A change in statutory tax rate in any country would result in the revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the period in which the new tax law is enacted. This change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The Company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the countries where it operates. Changes to the statutory tax rate may occur at any time, and any related expense or benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted. On September 28, 2018 the Swiss Parliament approved the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (Swiss Tax Reform). However, a referendum has been called and, as a result, a public vote on the Swiss Tax Reform 32 will take place on May 19th, 2019. If the Swiss Tax Reform passes, then the measures are expected to come into force in either January 2020 or January 2021. Prior to approval in the referendum and its subsequent cantonal implementation, the proposed Swiss Tax Reform is not enacted and therefore the Company has not reflected any of the potential impacts in its fiscal results. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the proposed Swiss Tax Reform, and when enacted, the law may have a material impact on the Company’s operating results. The Company faces various worldwide health care changes that may continue to result in pricing pressures that include health care cost containment and government legislation relating to sales, promotions and reimbursement of health care products. Changes in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of health care products and services, including delaying medical procedures, rationing prescription medications, reducing the frequency of physician visits and foregoing health care insurance coverage, as a result of the current global economic downturn, may continue to impact the Company’s businesses. The Company also operates in an environment increasingly hostile to intellectual property rights. Firms have filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications or Biosimilar Biological Product Applications with the FDA or otherwise challenged the coverage and/or validity of the Company's patents, seeking to market generic or biosimilar forms of many of the Company’s key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. In the event the Company is not successful in defending the patent claims challenged in the resulting lawsuits, generic or biosimilar versions of the products at issue will be introduced to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for those products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. There is also a risk that one or more competitors could launch a generic or biosimilar version of the product at issue following regulatory approval even though one or more valid patents are in place. For further information, see the discussion on “REMICADE ® Related Cases” and “Litigation Against Filers of Abbreviated New Drug Applications” in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Legal Proceedings Johnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial and other matters; governmental investigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. The Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for certain litigation matters and continues to monitor each related legal issue and adjust accruals for new information and further developments in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 450-20-25. For these and other litigation and regulatory matters currently disclosed for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts already accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors, including whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; or there are numerous parties involved. In the Company's opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with counsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company's balance sheet, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position. However, the resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and cash flows for that period. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding legal proceedings. Common Stock The Company’s Common Stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol JNJ. As of February 15, 2019, there were 142,029 record holders of Common Stock of the Company.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company). Intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated. Description of the Company and Business Segments The Company has approximately 135,100 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the health care field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world and its primary focus is on products related to human health and well-being. The Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. The Consumer segment includes a broad range of products used in the baby care, oral care, beauty, over-the-counter pharmaceutical, women’s health and wound care markets. These products are marketed to the general public and sold both to retail outlets and distributors throughout the world. The Pharmaceutical segment is focused on six therapeutic areas, including immunology, infectious diseases, neuroscience, oncology, pulmonary hypertension, and cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Products in this segment are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers, hospitals and health care professionals for prescription use. The Medical Devices segment includes a broad range of products used in the orthopaedic, surgery, interventional solutions (cardiovascular and neurovascular), diabetes care (divested in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2018) and vision fields, which are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics. New Accounting Standards Recently Adopted Accounting Standards ASU 2014-09 : Revenue from Contracts with Customers On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted the new accounting standard, ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers and all the related amendments (new revenue standard) to all contracts using the modified retrospective method. The cumulative effect of initially applying the new revenue standard was recognized as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. The comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. The adoption of the new revenue standard has not had a material impact to either reported Sales to customers or Net earnings. Additionally, the Company will continue to recognize revenue from product sales as goods are shipped or delivered to the customer, as control of goods transfers at the same time. In accordance with the new revenue standard requirements, the disclosure of the impact of adoption on the Company's Consolidated Statement of Earnings and Balance Sheet was as follows: Statement of Earnings - For the fiscal year ended December 30, 2018 (Dollars in millions) As Reported Effect of change Balance without adoption of ASC 606 Sales to customers $ 81,581 (35 ) 81,546 Net earnings 15,297 (28 ) 15,269 Balance Sheet - As of December 30, 2018 As Reported Effect of change Balance without adoption of ASC 606 Assets 152,954 23 152,977 Liabilities 93,202 4 93,206 Equity $ 59,752 19 59,771 The Company made a cumulative effect adjustment to the 2018 opening balance of retained earnings upon adoption of ASU 2014-09, which decreased beginning retained earnings by $47 million . As part of the adoption of ASC 606 see Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further disaggregation of revenue. 41 ASU 2016-01 : Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities The Company adopted this standard as of the beginning of the fiscal year 2018 on a modified retrospective basis. The amendments in this update supersede the guidance to classify equity securities with readily determinable fair values into different categories (that is, trading or available-for-sale) and require equity securities to be measured at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized through net earnings. The standard amends financial reporting by providing relevant information about an entity’s equity investments and reducing the number of items that are recognized in other comprehensive income. The Company made a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings upon adoption of ASU 2016-01 that increased retained earnings by $232 million net of tax and decreased accumulated other comprehensive income for previously unrealized gains from equity investments. For additional details see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. ASU 2016-16 : Income Taxes: Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory The Company adopted this standard as of the beginning of the fiscal year 2018. This update removes the current exception in U.S. GAAP prohibiting entities from recognizing current and deferred income tax expenses or benefits related to transfer of assets, other than inventory, within the consolidated entity. The current exception to defer the recognition of any tax impact on the transfer of inventory within the consolidated entity until it is sold to a third party remains unaffected. As discussed further in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2018 the Company elected an accounting policy to treat the tax on global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) under the deferred tax accounting model. As a result, the Company is required to record an additional deferred tax liability related to the basis difference of these intra-entity asset transfers. The Company recorded net adjustments including an increase to deferred tax assets of approximately $2.0 billion , an increase to deferred tax liabilities of approximately $1.7 billion , related to the GILTI accounting policy election in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2018, a decrease to Other Assets of approximately $0.7 billion and a decrease to retained earnings of approximately $0.4 billion . The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. ASU 2017-01 : Clarifying the Definition of a Business The Company adopted this standard as of the beginning of the fiscal year 2018. This update narrows the definition of a business by providing a screen to determine when an integrated set of assets and activities is not a business. The screen specifies that an integrated set of assets and activities is not a business if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired or disposed of is concentrated in a single or a group of similar identifiable assets. This update was applied prospectively. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. ASU 2017-07 : Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost The Company adopted this standard as of the beginning of the fiscal year 2018. This update requires that an employer disaggregate the service cost component from the other components of net periodic benefit cost (NPBC). In addition, only the service cost component will be eligible for capitalization. The amendments in this update are required to be applied retrospectively for the presentation of the service cost component and the other components of NPBC in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings and prospectively, on and after the adoption date, for the capitalization of the service cost component of NPBC in assets. As required by the transition provisions of this update, the following table shows the impact of the adoption on the respective line items in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings for 2018 and the reclassifications to the 2017 and 2016 fiscal year Consolidated Statement of Earnings to retroactively apply classification of the service cost component and the other components of NPBC: (Dollars In millions) Increase (Decrease) to Net Expense 2018 2017 2016 Cost of products sold $ 51 85 104 Selling, marketing and administrative expenses 55 100 122 Research and development expense 21 40 48 Other (income) expense, net (127 ) (225 ) (274 ) Earnings before provision for taxes on income $ — — — 42 The following table summarizes the cumulative effect adjustments made to the 2018 opening balance of retained earnings upon adoption of the new accounting standards mentioned above: (Dollars in Millions) Cumulative Effect Adjustment Increase (Decrease) to Retained Earnings ASU 2014-09 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers $ (47 ) ASU 2016-01 - Financial Instruments 232 ASU 2016-16 - Income Taxes: Intra-Entity Transfers (439 ) Total $ (254 ) ASU 2017-12 : Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities The Company elected to early adopt this standard as of the beginning of the fiscal second quarter of 2018. This update makes more financial and nonfinancial hedging strategies eligible for hedge accounting. It also amends the presentation and disclosure requirements and changes how companies assess effectiveness. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. For additional required disclosures see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Adopted as of December 30, 2018 ASU 2018-18 : Collaborative Arrangements This update clarifies the interaction between ASC 808, Collaborative Arrangements and ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The update clarifies that certain transactions between participants in a collaborative arrangement should be accounted for under ASC 606 when the counterparty is a customer. In addition, the update precludes an entity from presenting consideration from a transaction in a collaborative arrangement as revenue if the counterparty is not a customer for that transaction. This update will be effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years. ASU 2018-18 should be applied retrospectively to the date of initial application of ASC 606 and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this update on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. ASU 2018-16: Derivatives and Hedging (Topic ASC 815) This update adds the Overnight Index Swap (OIS) rate based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as an eligible benchmark interest rate permitted in the application of hedge accounting. This update will be effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted if an entity has adopted ASU 2017-12. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this update on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. ASU 2018-02 : Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income This update allows a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Job Act enacted in December 2017. This update will be effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company does not expect this standard to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. ASU 2016-13 : Financial Instruments - Credit Losses This update introduces the current expected credit loss (CECL) model, which will require an entity to measure credit losses for certain financial instruments and financial assets, including trade receivables. Under this update, on initial recognition and at each reporting period, an entity will be required to recognize an allowance that reflects the entity’s current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the financial instrument. This update will be effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this update on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. ASU 2016-02 : Leases This update requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for all lease obligations and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. This update requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under current generally accepted accounting principles. This update will be effective for the Company for all annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company will apply the new standard at its adoption date rather than at the earliest comparative period 43 presented in the financial statements. The Company’s operating leases will result in the recognition of additional assets and the corresponding liabilities on its Consolidated Balance Sheets. The adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. Cash Equivalents The Company classifies all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of three months or less from date of purchase as cash equivalents and all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of greater than three months from the date of purchase as current marketable securities. The Company has a policy of making investments only with commercial institutions that have at least an investment grade credit rating. The Company invests its cash primarily in government securities and obligations, corporate debt securities, money market funds and reverse repurchase agreements (RRAs). RRAs are collateralized by deposits in the form of Government Securities and Obligations for an amount not less than 102% of their value. The Company does not record an asset or liability as the Company is not permitted to sell or repledge the associated collateral. The Company has a policy that the collateral has at least an A (or equivalent) credit rating. The Company utilizes a third party custodian to manage the exchange of funds and ensure that collateral received is maintained at 102% of the value of the RRAs on a daily basis. RRAs with stated maturities of greater than three months from the date of purchase are classified as marketable securities. Investments Investments classified as held to maturity investments are reported at amortized cost and realized gains or losses are reported in earnings. Investments classified as available-for-sale are carried at estimated fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Available-for-sale securities available for current operations are classified as current assets otherwise, they are classified as long term. Management determines the appropriate classification of its investment in debt and equity securities at the time of purchase and re-evaluates such determination at each balance sheet date. The Company reviews its investments in equity securities for impairment and adjusts these investments to fair value through earnings, as required. Property, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. The Company utilizes the straight-line method of depreciation over the estimated useful lives of the assets: Building and building equipment 20 - 30 years Land and leasehold improvements 10 - 20 years Machinery and equipment 2 - 13 years The Company capitalizes certain computer software and development costs, included in machinery and equipment, when incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use. Capitalized software costs are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the software, which generally range from 3 to 8 years. The Company reviews long-lived assets to assess recoverability using undiscounted cash flows. When certain events or changes in operating or economic conditions occur, an impairment assessment may be performed on the recoverability of the carrying value of these assets. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset’s fair value and its carrying value. If quoted market prices are not available, the Company will estimate fair value using a discounted value of estimated future cash flows. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the goods to customers. The Company's global payment terms are typically between 30 to 90 days. Provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns and discounts to customers are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales. Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants, as well as market conditions, including consideration of competitor pricing. Rebates are estimated based on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served. The Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through the analysis of wholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally generated information. Sales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals. Sales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in the field, or in specific areas, product recall. The sales returns reserve is based on historical return trends by product and by market as a percent to gross sales. In accordance with the Company’s accounting policies, the Company generally issues credit to 44 customers for returned goods. The Company’s sales returns reserves are accounted for in accordance with the U.S. GAAP guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns reserves are recorded at full sales value. Sales returns in the Consumer and Pharmaceutical segments are almost exclusively not resalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the Medical Devices segment are typically resalable but are not material. The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products. The sales returns reserve for the total Company has been approximately 1.0% of annual net trade sales during the fiscal reporting years 2018, 2017 and 2016. Promotional programs, such as product listing allowances and cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in the same period as related sales. Continuing promotional programs include coupons and volume-based sales incentive programs. The redemption cost of consumer coupons is based on historical redemption experience by product and value. Volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales volumes for the incentive period and are recorded as products are sold. These arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred or recorded as a reduction of revenue. The Company also earns profit-share payments through collaborative arrangements for certain products, which are included in sales to customers. For all years presented, profit-share payments were less than 2.0% of the total revenues and are included in sales to customers. Shipping and Handling Shipping and handling costs incurred were $1,090 million , $1,042 million and $974 million in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively, and are included in selling, marketing and administrative expense. The amount of revenue received for shipping and handling is less than 0.5% of sales to customers for all periods presented. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value determined by the first-in, first-out method. Intangible Assets and Goodwill The authoritative literature on U.S. GAAP requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives be assessed annually for impairment. The Company completed the annual impairment test for 2018 in the fiscal fourth quarter. Future impairment tests will be performed annually in the fiscal fourth quarter, or sooner if warranted. Purchased in-process research and development is accounted for as an indefinite lived intangible asset until the underlying project is completed, at which point the intangible asset will be accounted for as a definite lived intangible asset, or abandoned, at which point the intangible asset will be written off or partially impaired. Intangible assets that have finite useful lives continue to be amortized over their useful lives, and are reviewed for impairment when warranted by economic conditions. See Note 5 for further details on Intangible Assets and Goodwill. Financial Instruments As required by U.S. GAAP, all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Fair value is the exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is a market-based measurement determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The authoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value, with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction. The Company documents all relationships between hedged items and derivatives. The overall risk management strategy includes reasons for undertaking hedge transactions and entering into derivatives. The objectives of this strategy are: (1) minimize foreign currency exposure’s impact on the Company’s financial performance; (2) protect the Company’s cash flow from adverse movements in foreign exchange rates; (3) ensure the appropriateness of financial instruments; and (4) manage the enterprise risk associated with financial institutions. See Note 6 for additional information on Financial Instruments. Product Liability Accruals for product liability claims are recorded, on an undiscounted basis, when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information and actuarially determined estimates where applicable. The accruals are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available. The Company accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to defend each matter when those costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. To the extent adverse verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated. As a result of cost and availability factors, effective November 1, 2005, the Company ceased purchasing third-party product liability insurance. The Company has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals in the self insurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated. 45 Research and Development Research and development expenses are expensed as incurred in accordance with ASC 730, Research and Development. Upfront and milestone payments made to third parties in connection with research and development collaborations are expensed as incurred up to the point of regulatory approval. Payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related product. Amounts capitalized for such payments are included in other intangibles, net of accumulated amortization. The Company enters into collaborative arrangements, typically with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies, to develop and commercialize drug candidates or intellectual property. These arrangements typically involve two (or more) parties who are active participants in the collaboration and are exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of the activities. These collaborations usually involve various activities by one or more parties, including research and development, marketing and selling and distribution. Often, these collaborations require upfront, milestone and royalty or profit share payments, contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development. Amounts due from collaborative partners related to development activities are generally reflected as a reduction of research and development expense because the performance of contract development services is not central to the Company’s operations. In general, the income statement presentation for these collaborations is as follows: Nature/Type of Collaboration Statement of Earnings Presentation Third-party sale of product & profit share payments received Sales to customers Royalties/milestones paid to collaborative partner (post-regulatory approval)* Cost of products sold Royalties received from collaborative partner Other income (expense), net Upfront payments & milestones paid to collaborative partner (pre-regulatory approval) Research and development expense Research and development payments to collaborative partner Research and development expense Research and development payments received from collaborative partner Reduction of Research and development expense * Milestones are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to cost of products sold over the useful life. For all years presented, there was no individual project that represented greater than 5% of the total annual consolidated research and development expense. The Company has a number of products and compounds developed in collaboration with strategic partners including XARELTO ® , co-developed with Bayer HealthCare AG and IMBRUVICA ® , developed in collaboration and co-marketed with Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie company. The Company has a number of licensing arrangements for products and compounds including DARZALEX ® , licensed from Genmab A/S. Advertising Costs associated with advertising are expensed in the year incurred and are included in selling, marketing and administrative expenses. Advertising expenses worldwide, which comprised television, radio, print media and Internet advertising, were $2.6 billion , $2.5 billion and $2.4 billion in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Income Taxes Income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and include the results of any difference between U.S. GAAP accounting and tax reporting, recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities. The Company estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on enacted tax regulations and rates. Future changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. The Company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company follows U.S. GAAP which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Management believes that changes in these estimates would not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial position. In the fourth fiscal quarter of 2018, the Company has elected to account for the GILTI tax under the deferred method. The deferred tax amounts recorded are based on the evaluation of temporary differences that are expected to reverse as GILTI is incurred. The Company has recorded deferred tax liabilities on all undistributed earnings prior to December 31, 2017 from its international subsidiaries. The Company has not provided deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings subsequent to January 1, 2018 from certain international subsidiaries where the earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. The Company intends to continue to reinvest these earnings in those international operations. If the Company decides at a later date to 46 repatriate these earnings to the U.S., the Company would be required to provide for the net tax effects on these amounts. The Company estimates that the total tax effect of this repatriation would be approximately $0.7 billion under current enacted tax laws and regulations and at current currency exchange rates. See Note 8 for further information regarding income taxes. Net Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities were exercised or converted into common stock using the treasury stock method. Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Estimates are used when accounting for sales discounts, rebates, allowances and incentives, product liabilities, income taxes, withholding taxes, depreciation, amortization, employee benefits, contingencies and intangible asset and liability valuations. Actual results may or may not differ from those estimates. The Company follows the provisions of U.S. GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies. A liability is recorded when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. The best estimate of a loss within a range is accrued; however, if no estimate in the range is better than any other, the minimum amount is accrued. Annual Closing Date The Company follows the concept of a fiscal year, which ends on the Sunday nearest to the end of the month of December. Normally each fiscal year consists of 52 weeks, but every five or six years the fiscal year consists of 53 weeks , and therefore includes additional shipping days, as was the case in 2015, and will be the case again in 2020. Reclassification Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation. 2. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Current Marketable Securities At the end of 2018 and 2017 , cash, cash equivalents and current marketable securities were comprised of: (Dollars in Millions) 2018 Carrying Amount Estimated Fair Value Cash & Cash Equivalents Current Marketable Securities Cash $ 2,619 2,619 2,619 — U.S. Reverse repurchase agreements 3,009 3,009 3,009 — Other Reverse repurchase agreements 443 443 443 — Money market funds 3,397 3,397 3,397 — Time deposits (1) 485 485 485 — Subtotal $ 9,953 9,953 9,953 — Gov't Securities $ 9,474 9,474 8,144 1,330 Corporate debt securities 260 260 10 250 Subtotal available for sale (2) $ 9,734 9,734 8,154 1,580 Total cash, cash equivalents and current marketable securities $ 18,107 1,580 In 2018, the carrying amount was the same as the estimated fair value.

(2) Available for sale debt securities are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported net of taxes in other comprehensive income. Fair value of government securities and obligations and corporate debt securities were estimated using quoted broker prices and significant other observable inputs. The contractual maturities of the available for sale debt securities at December 30, 2018 are as follows: (Dollars in Millions) Cost Basis Fair Value Due within one year $ 9,670 9,670 Due after one year through five years 64 64 Due after five years through ten years — — Total debt securities $ 9,734 9,734 The Company invests its excess cash in both deposits with major banks throughout the world and other high-quality money market instruments. The Company has a policy of making investments only with commercial institutions that have at least an investment grade credit rating. 3. Inventories At the end of 2018 and 2017 , inventories were comprised of: (Dollars in Millions) 2018 2017 Raw materials and supplies $ 1,114 1,140 Goods in process 2,109 2,317 Finished goods 5,376 5,308 Total inventories $ 8,599 (1) 8,765 (1) Net of assets held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheet for approximately $0.2 billion related to the divestiture of the Advanced Sterilization Products business and $0.3 billion related to the strategic collaboration with Jabil Inc., both of which were pending as of December 30, 2018. 48 4. Property, Plant and Equipment At the end of 2018 and 2017 , property, plant and equipment at cost and accumulated depreciation were: (Dollars in Millions) 2018 2017 Land and land improvements $ 807 829 Buildings and building equipment 11,176 11,240 Machinery and equipment 25,992 25,949 Construction in progress 3,876 3,448 Total property, plant and equipment, gross $ 41,851 41,466 Less accumulated depreciation 24,816 24,461 Total property, plant and equipment, net $ 17,035 (1) 17,005 (1) Net of assets held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheet for approximately $0.1 billion related to the divestiture of the Advanced Sterilization Products business and $0.1 billion related to the strategic collaboration with Jabil Inc., both of which were pending as of December 30, 2018. The Company capitalizes interest expense as part of the cost of construction of facilities and equipment. Interest expense capitalized in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 was $86 million , $94 million and $102 million , respectively. Depreciation expense, including the amortization of capitalized interest in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 was $2.6 billion , $2.6 billion and $2.5 billion , respectively. Upon retirement or other disposal of property, plant and equipment, the costs and related amounts of accumulated depreciation or amortization are eliminated from the asset and accumulated depreciation accounts, respectively. The difference, if any, between the net asset value and the proceeds are recorded in earnings. 5. Intangible Assets and Goodwill At the end of 2018 and 2017 , the gross and net amounts of intangible assets were: (Dollars in Millions) 2018 2017 Intangible assets with definite lives: Patents and trademarks — gross $ 35,194 36,427 Less accumulated amortization 9,784 7,223 Patents and trademarks — net $ 25,410 29,204 Customer relationships and other intangibles — gross $ 21,334 20,204 Less accumulated amortization 8,323 7,463 Customer relationships and other intangibles — net $ 13,011 12,741 Intangible assets with indefinite lives: Trademarks $ 6,937 7,082 Purchased in-process research and development (1) 2,253 4,201 Total intangible assets with indefinite lives $ 9,190 11,283 Total intangible assets — net $ 47,611 53,228 (1) The decrease was primarily attributable to the write-down of $1.1 billion related to the assets acquired in the acquisitions of Alios Biopharma Inc. (Alios) and XO1 Limited (XO1). Of the $1.1 billion , the Company recorded a partial impairment charge of $0.8 billion related to the development program of AL-8176, an investigational drug for the treatment of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) acquired with the 2014 acquisition of Alios. The impairment charge was calculated based on updated cash flow projections discounted for the inherent risk in the asset development and reflects the impact of the phase 2b clinical trial suspension, a decrease in the probability of success factors and the ongoing analysis of asset development activities. In addition, an impairment charge of $0.3 billion was recorded for the discontinuation of the development project for an anti-thrombin antibody associated with the 2015 acquisition of XO1. Additionally, $0.8 billion of IPR&D related to ERLEADA ™ was reclassified to definite lived intangible assets upon commercialization. 49 Goodwill as of December 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 , as allocated by segment of business, was as follows: (Dollars in Millions) Consumer Pharmaceutical Medical Devices Total Goodwill at January 1, 2017 $ 8,263 2,840 11,702 22,805 Goodwill, related to acquisitions (1) 102 6,161 2,200 8,463 Goodwill, related to divestitures (74 ) (1 ) (102 ) (177 ) Currency translation/other 584 109 122 815 Goodwill at December 31, 2017 $ 8,875 9,109 13,922 31,906 Goodwill, related to acquisitions 168 51 184 403 Goodwill, related to divestitures — — (1,348 ) (2) (1,348 ) Currency translation/other (373 ) (97 ) (38 ) (508 ) Goodwill at December 30, 2018 $ 8,670 9,063 12,720 30,453 (1) Goodwill of $6.2 billion related to the Actelion acquisition acquired in the fiscal second quarter of 2017, within the Pharmaceutical segment and $1.7 billion related to the AMO acquisition acquired in the fiscal first quarter of 2017, within the Medical Devices segment. (2) Goodwill of $1.0 billion is related to the divestiture of the LifeScan business. Goodwill of $0.3 billion is related to the divestiture of the Advanced Sterilization Products business, which was pending and classified as assets held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 30, 2018. The weighted average amortization periods for patents and trademarks and customer relationships and other intangible assets are 11 years and 22 years , respectively. The amortization expense of amortizable assets included in cost of products sold was $4.4 billion , $3.0 billion and $1.2 billion before tax, for the fiscal years ended December 30, 2018 , December 31, 2017 and January 1, 2017 , respectively. The estimated amortization expense for the five succeeding years approximates $4.3 billion before tax, per year. Intangible asset write-downs are included in Other (income) expense, net. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to acquisitions and divestitures. 6. Fair Value Measurements The Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to manage its exposure to the variability of cash flows, primarily related to the foreign exchange rate changes of future intercompany products and third-party purchases of materials denominated in a foreign currency. The Company uses cross currency interest rate swaps to manage currency risk primarily related to borrowings. Both types of derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges. Additionally, the Company uses interest rate swaps as an instrument to manage interest rate risk related to fixed rate borrowings. These derivatives are designated as fair value hedges. The Company uses cross currency interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges. Additionally, the Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to offset its exposure to certain foreign currency assets and liabilities. These forward foreign exchange contracts are not designated as hedges and therefore, changes in the fair values of these derivatives are recognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the related foreign currency assets and liabilities. The Company early adopted ASU 2017-12: Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedge Activities effective as of the beginning of fiscal second quarter of 2018. The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes, or that contain credit risk related contingent features. During the fiscal second quarter of 2017, the Company entered into credit support agreements (CSA) with certain derivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on respective credit ratings and netting agreements. As of December 30, 2018 , the total amount of collateral paid under the credit support agreements (CSA) amounted to $182 million net. On an ongoing basis, the Company monitors counter-party credit ratings. The Company considers credit non-performance risk to be low, because the Company primarily enters into agreements with commercial institutions that have at least an investment grade credit rating. Refer to the table on significant financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value contained in this footnote for receivables and payables with these commercial institutions. As of December 30, 2018 , the Company had notional amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange contracts, cross currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps of $41.1 billion , $7.3 billion , and $0.5 billion respectively. As of December 31, 2017 , the Company had notional amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange contracts, cross currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps of $34.5 billion , $2.3 billion , and $1.1 billion respectively. 50 All derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction. The designation as a cash flow hedge is made at the entrance date of the derivative contract. At inception, all derivatives are expected to be highly effective. Foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges are accounted for under the forward method and all gains/losses associated with these contracts will be recognized in the income statement when the hedged item impacts earnings. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income until the underlying transaction affects earnings, and are then reclassified to earnings in the same account as the hedged transaction. Gains and losses associated with interest rate swaps and changes in fair value of hedged debt attributable to changes in interest rates are recorded to interest expense in the period in which they occur. Gains and losses on net investment hedge are accounted through the currency translation account within accumulated other comprehensive income. The portion excluded from effectiveness testing is recorded through interest (income) expense using the spot method. On an ongoing basis, the Company assesses whether each derivative continues to be highly effective in offsetting changes of hedged items. If and when a derivative is no longer expected to be highly effective, hedge accounting is discontinued. During the fiscal second quarter of 2016, the Company designated its Euro denominated notes issued in May 2016 with due dates ranging from 2022 to 2035 as a net investment hedge of the Company's investments in certain of its international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their functional currency in order to reduce the volatility caused by changes in exchange rates. As of December 30, 2018 , the balance of deferred net loss on derivatives included in accumulated other comprehensive income was $195 million after-tax. For additional information, see the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and Note 13. The Company expects that substantially all of the amounts related to forward foreign exchange contracts will be reclassified into earnings over the next 12 months as a result of transactions that are expected to occur over that period. The maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging transaction exposure is 18 months , excluding interest rate contracts, net investment hedges and equity collar contracts. The amount ultimately realized in earnings may differ as foreign exchange rates change. Realized gains and losses are ultimately determined by actual exchange rates at maturity of the derivative. 51 The following table is a summary of the activity related to derivatives and hedges for the fiscal years ended December 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 : December 30, 2018 December 31, 2017 (Dollars in Millions) Sales Cost of Products Sold R&D Expense Interest (Income) Expense Other (Income) Expense Sales Cost of Products Sold R&D Expense Interest (Income) Expense Other (Income) Expense The effects of fair value, net investment and cash flow hedging: Gain (Loss) on fair value hedging relationship: Interest rate swaps contracts: Hedged items $ — — — 5 — — — — 5 — Derivatives designated as hedging instruments — — — (5 ) — — — — (5 ) — Gain (Loss) on net investment hedging relationship: Cross currency interest rate swaps contracts: Amount of gain or (loss) recognized in income on derivative amount excluded from effectiveness testing — — — 56 — — — — — — Amount of gain or (loss) recognized in AOCI — — — 56 — — — — — — Gain (Loss) on cash flow hedging relationship: Forward foreign exchange contracts: Amount of gain or (loss) reclassified from AOCI into income (1) 47 200 (220 ) — (24 ) (31 ) (159 ) (165 ) — (87 ) Amount of gain or (loss) recognized in AOCI (1) (32 ) (17 ) (193 ) — (4 ) 49 96 (199 ) — (60 ) Cross currency interest rate swaps contracts: Amount of gain or (loss) reclassified from AOCI into income — — — 133 — — — — 83 — Amount of gain or (loss) recognized in AOCI $ — — — 117 — — — — 110 — (1) Includes equity collar contracts. The equity collar contracts expired in December of 2017. For the fiscal years ended December 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 , the following amounts were recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet Line item in the Consolidated Balance Sheet in which the hedged item is included Carrying Amount of the Hedged Liability Cumulative Amount of Fair Value Hedging Adjustment Included in the Carrying Amount of the Hedged Liability (Dollars in Millions) December 30, 2018 December 31, 2017 December 30, 2018 December 31, 2017 Current Portion of Long-term Debt $ 494 597 5 2 Long-term Debt — 496 — 3 52 The following table is the effect of derivatives not designated as hedging instrument for the fiscal years ended December 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017: (Dollars in Millions) Location of Gain /(Loss) Recognized in Income on Derivative Gain/(Loss) Recognized In Income on Derivative Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments December 30, 2018 December 31, 2017 Foreign Exchange Contracts Other (income) expense (68 ) (5 ) The following table is the effect of net investment hedges for the fiscal years ended December 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017: Gain/(Loss) Recognized In Accumulated OCI Location of Gain or (Loss) Reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income Into Income Gain/(Loss) Reclassified From Accumulated OCI Into Income (Dollars in Millions) Fiscal Nine Months Ended December 30, 2018 December 31, 2017 December 30, 2018 December 31, 2017 Debt $ 218 (597 ) Other (income) expense — — Cross Currency interest rate swaps $ 150 — Other (income) expense — — The Company adopted ASU 2016-01: Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities as of the beginning of the fiscal year 2018. This ASU amends prior guidance to classify equity investments with readily determinable market values into different categories (that is, trading or available-for-sale) and require equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized through net earnings. The Company made a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings upon adoption of ASU 2016-01 which increased retained earnings by $232 million , net of tax, and decreased accumulated other comprehensive income for previously net unrealized gains from equity investments. The Company holds equity investments with readily determinable fair values and equity investments without readily determinable fair values. The Company has elected to measure equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. The following table is a summary of the activity related to equity investments as of December 30, 2018 : (Dollars in Millions) December 31, 2017 December 30, 2018 Carrying Value Changes in Fair Value Reflected in Net Income (1) Sales/ Purchases/Other (2) Carrying Value Non Current Other Assets Equity Investments with readily determinable value $ 751 (247 ) 7 511 511 Equity Investments without readily determinable value $ 510 13 158 681 681 (1) Recorded in Other Income/Expense (2) Other includes impact of currency For equity investments without readily determinable market values, $54 million of the changes in fair value reflected in net income were the result of impairments. There were $67 million of changes in fair value reflected in net income due to changes in observable prices. 53 For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 , changes in fair value reflected within other comprehensive income due to previously unrealized gains on equity investments with readily determinable fair values net of tax was a net gain of $232 million . Fair value is the exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is a market-based measurement determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The authoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels within the hierarchy are described below with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest. The fair value of a derivative financial instrument (i.e., forward foreign exchange contracts, interest rate contracts) is the aggregation by currency of all future cash flows discounted to its present value at the prevailing market interest rates and subsequently converted to the U.S. Dollar at the current spot foreign exchange rate. The Company does not believe that fair values of these derivative instruments materially differ from the amounts that could be realized upon settlement or maturity, or that the changes in fair value will have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position. The Company also holds equity investments which are classified as Level 1 and debt securities which are classified as Level 2. The Company did not have any other significant financial assets or liabilities which would require revised valuations under this standard that are recognized at fair value. The following three levels of inputs are used to measure fair value: Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. Level 2 — Significant other observable inputs. Level 3 — Significant unobservable inputs. The Company’s significant financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value as of December 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 were as follows: 2018 2017 (Dollars in Millions) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Total (1) Derivatives designated as hedging instruments: Assets: Forward foreign exchange contracts $ — 501 — 501 418 Interest rate contracts (2)(4) — 161 — 161 7 Total — 662 — 662 425 Liabilities: Forward foreign exchange contracts — 548 — 548 402 Interest rate contracts (3)(4) — 292 — 292 165 Total — 840 — 840 567 Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments: Assets: Forward foreign exchange contracts — 32 — 32 38 Liabilities: Forward foreign exchange contracts — 32 — 32 38 Available For Sale Other Investments: Equity investments (5) 511 — — 511 751 Debt securities (6) $ — 9,734 — 9,734 5,310 54 Gross to Net Derivative Reconciliation 2018 2017 (Dollars in Millions) Total Gross Assets $ 694 463 Credit Support Agreement (CSA) (423 ) (76 ) Total Net Asset 271 387 Total Gross Liabilities 872 605 Credit Support Agreement (CSA) (605 ) (238 ) Total Net Liabilities $ 267 367 (1) 2017 assets and liabilities are all classified as Level 2 with the exception of equity investments of $751 million , which are classified as Level 1.

(3) Includes $3 million and $9 million of non-current liabilities for the fiscal years ending December 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 , respectively. (4) Includes cross currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps. (5) Classified as non-current other assets.

Fair value of the long-term debt was estimated using market prices, which were corroborated by quoted broker prices and significant other observable inputs.(Level 2) The Company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous banks worldwide. In September 2018 , the Company secured a new 364-day Credit Facility. Total credit available to the Company approximates $10 billion , which expires on September 12, 2019 . Interest charged on borrowings under the credit line agreements is based on either bids provided by banks, the prime rate or London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR), plus applicable margins. Commitment fees under the agreements are not material. Throughout 2018 , the Company continued to have access to liquidity through the commercial paper market. Short-term borrowings and the current portion of long-term debt amounted to approximately $2.8 billion at the end of 2018 , of which $2.6 billion is the current portion of the long term debt, and the remainder principally represents local borrowing by international subsidiaries. Throughout 2017, the Company continued to have access to liquidity through the commercial paper market. Short-term borrowings and the current portion of long-term debt amounted to approximately $3.9 billion at the end of 2017, of which $2.3 billion was borrowed under the Commercial Paper Program, $1.5 billion is the current portion of the long-term debt, and the remainder principally represents local borrowing by international subsidiaries.

International operations reflects the impacts of operations in jurisdictions with statutory tax rates different than the U.S., particularly Ireland, Switzerland and Puerto Rico, which is a favorable impact on the effective tax rate as compared with the U.S. statutory rate. The 2017 amount also includes tax cost related to the revaluation of deferred tax balances related to the change in the Belgian statutory tax rate increasing the tax provision by approximately 3.4% . (2) Includes the impact of the GILTI tax, the Foreign-Derived Intangible Income deduction and other foreign income that is taxable under the U.S. tax code. (3) Represents impact of adjustments to the 2017 TCJA provisional tax charge. This also includes a net tax benefit from the reduction of a deferred tax liability related to foreign withholding taxes originally accrued as part of the provisional charge. This benefit reduced the Company’s effective tax rate by approximately 11% . Further description is included below. (4) Includes U.S. state and local taxes provisionally recorded as part TCJA provisional charge which was approximately 0.6% of the total effective tax rate. On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted into law new U.S. tax legislation, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). This law included provisions for a comprehensive overhaul of the corporate income tax code, including a reduction of the statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective on January 1, 2018. This legislation also eliminated or reduced certain corporate income tax deductions as well as introduced new provisions that taxed certain foreign income not previously taxed by the United States. The TCJA also included a provision for a tax on all previously undistributed earnings of U.S. companies located in foreign jurisdictions. Undistributed earnings in the form of cash and cash equivalents were taxed at a rate of 15.5% and all other earnings are taxed at a rate of 8.0%. This tax is payable over 8 years and will not accrue interest and these payments began in 2018 and will continue through 2025. The remaining balance at the end of the fiscal year 2018 was approximately $8.2 billion . In December 2017, the SEC provided regulatory guidance for accounting of the impacts of the TCJA, referred to as SAB 118. Under the guidance in SAB 118, the income tax effects, which the accounting under ASC 740 is incomplete, are reported as a provisional amount based on a reasonable estimate. The reasonable estimate is subject to adjustment during a ""measurement period"", not to exceed one year, until the accounting is complete. The estimate is also subject to the finalization of management’s analysis related to certain matters, such as developing interpretations of the provision of the TCJA, changes to certain estimates and amounts related to the earnings and profits of certain subsidiaries and the filing of tax returns. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recorded a provisional tax cost of approximately $13.0 billion which consisted primarily of the following components: • a $10.1 billion charge on previously undistributed foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017 • a $4.5 billion deferred tax liability for foreign local and withholding taxes, offset by a $1.1 billion deferred tax asset for U.S. foreign tax credits, for repatriation of substantially all those earnings • a $0.6 billion tax benefit relating to the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities and the impact of the TCJA on unrecognized tax benefits • a $0.1 billion charge for U.S. state and local taxes on the repatriation of these foreign earnings During the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company completed its full assessment and finalized the accounting for the impact of TCJA. The Company recorded net adjustments to the above components of the provisional charge of approximately $0.2 billion . These revisions were based on updated estimates and additional analysis by management as well as applying 58 interpretative guidance issued by the U.S. Department of Treasury to the facts and circumstances that existed as of the TCJA enactment date. This charge was primarily related to additional deferred tax liabilities for foreign local and withholding taxes for the remaining balance of undistributed foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017 that were not provided for in the provisional charge in the fourth quarter of 2017. The TCJA also includes provisions for a tax on global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI). GILTI is described as the excess of a U.S. shareholder’s total net foreign income over a deemed return on tangible assets, as provided by the TCJA. In January 2018, the FASB issued guidance that allows companies to elect as an accounting policy whether to record the tax effects of GILTI in the period the tax liability is generated (i.e., “period cost”) or provide for deferred tax assets and liabilities related to basis differences that exist and are expected to effect the amount of GILTI inclusion in future years upon reversal (i.e., “deferred method”). Through the third fiscal quarter of 2018, the Company had provisionally elected to treat GILTI as a period expense. Upon further analysis of this new tax provision, the Company has elected to account for GILTI under the deferred method. The deferred tax amounts recorded are based on the evaluation of temporary differences that are expected to reverse as GILTI is incurred. As a result of this election, the Company recorded a deferred tax cost related to GILTI of approximately $1.4 billion in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2018 related to facts and circumstances that existed on the date of TCJA enactment. As a result of the GILTI deferred tax charge and the other adjustments to the provisional amount, the Company recorded a total of $1.6 billion of adjustments to the 2017 provisional charge increasing the Company’s annual effective tax rate by approximately 9% . During 2018, the Company reorganized the ownership structure of certain foreign subsidiaries which resulted in a reduction of certain foreign withholding taxes that it had recognized as part of the provisional TCJA tax charge in the fourth quarter of 2017. Following the completion of this restructuring in the fourth quarter 2018, and as a result of clarification by Swiss tax authorities regarding the applicability of withholding tax to repatriation of certain earnings, the Company reversed a deferred tax liability of $2.8 billion and a related deferred tax asset of $0.9 billion for U.S. foreign tax credits, for a net deferred tax benefit of $1.9 billion . As this restructuring occurred after the TCJA enactment date, the benefit is not considered an adjustment to the provisional amount recorded in 2017 under SAB118. This benefit with the SAB 118 adjustments has been reflected as “TCJA and related impacts” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation. As described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, in 2018 the Company adopted ASU 2016-16: Income Taxes: Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory. This standard requires entities to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities related to transfer of assets, other than inventory, within the consolidated entity. At the beginning of fiscal 2018, the Company recorded a net adjustment to deferred tax assets of approximately $2.0 billion . In the fourth quarter of 2018, as a result of the election to record GILTI on the deferred method, the Company recorded a GILTI deferred tax liability of $1.7 billion related to the adoption provisions of ASU 2016-16 as an adjustment to retained earnings. The 2018 effective tax rate decreased by 77.6% compared to 2017. The 2017 effective tax rate was primarily driven by the approximately $13 billion provisional tax charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 and the impact of a Belgian statutory tax rate change which increased the 2017 effective rate by 3.4% . Additional drivers of the 2018 annual effective tax were: • the reduction of the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate including the effects of tax elections which resulted in the acceleration of certain deductions into the 2017 tax return. The impact of these accelerated deductions decreased the annual effective tax rate by approximately 1.7% • the impact of the adjustments to the 2017 provisional TCJA charge, including both SAB 118 adjustments and the internal restructuring, decreased the effective tax rate by approximately 1.9% • GILTI tax which increased the annual effective tax rate by approximately 1.6% , which excludes the impact of the SAB 118 adjustment for the adoption of the deferred method for GILTI • tax benefits received from stock-based compensation during fiscal 2018 and 2017, reduced the effective tax rate by 1.5% and 2.0% , respectively • in the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company completed the divestiture of its LifeScan business (Note 20), which increased the Company annual effective tax rate by approximately 0.8% • more income in higher tax jurisdictions relative to lower tax jurisdictions as compared to 2017 The 2017 effective tax rate increased by 76.1% as compared to 2016, primarily driven by the enactment of the TCJA in the U.S. in December 2017. The enactment of the TCJA resulted in a provisional tax charge in the fourth quarter of 2017, of approximately $13.0 billion or approximately 73.3 percentage point increase to the effective tax rate. The remainder of the increase in the tax rate for 2017 was related to the remeasurement of the Company’s deferred tax assets in Belgium, as a result of changes in the Belgian statutory corporate tax rate enacted in December 2017, offset by a tax benefit for the closure of the Company’s Animas insulin pump business. 59 Temporary differences and carryforwards for 2018 and 2017 were as follows: 2018 Deferred Tax 2017 Deferred Tax (Dollars in Millions) Asset Liability Asset Liability Employee related obligations $ 2,398 2,259 Stock based compensation 639 507 Depreciation & amortization 1,784 (9 ) Non-deductible intangibles (5,967 ) (6,506 ) International R&D capitalized for tax 1,282 1,307 Reserves & liabilities 1,647 1,718 Income reported for tax purposes 1,104 1,316 Net operating loss carryforward international 786 762 Undistributed foreign earnings 693 (2,240 ) 1,101 (4,457 ) Global intangible low-taxed income (2,971 ) Miscellaneous international 603 (93 ) 755 (194 ) Miscellaneous U.S. 469 177 Total deferred income taxes $ 11,405 (11,271 ) 9,902 (11,166 ) The Company has wholly-owned international subsidiaries that have cumulative net losses. The Company believes that it is more likely than not that these subsidiaries will generate future taxable income sufficient to utilize these deferred tax assets. The following table summarizes the activity related to unrecognized tax benefits: (Dollars in Millions) 2018 2017 2016 Beginning of year $ 3,151 3,041 3,080 Increases related to current year tax positions 242 332 348 Increases related to prior period tax positions 145 232 11 Decreases related to prior period tax positions (137 ) (416 ) (1) (338 ) Settlements (40 ) (2 ) (37 ) Lapse of statute of limitations (35 ) (36 ) (23 ) End of year $ 3,326 3,151 3,041 (1) In 2017, $347 million of this decrease is related to the TCJA The unrecognized tax benefits of $3.3 billion at December 30, 2018 , if recognized, would affect the Company’s annual effective tax rate. The Company conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and currently has tax audits in progress with a number of tax authorities. The IRS has completed its audit for the tax years through 2009 and is currently auditing the tax years 2010-2012. The Company currently expects completion of this audit during 2019. Final conclusion of the tax audit may result in an outcome that is different than the Company’s estimates and may result in a material impact on the Company’s current and future operating results or cash flows in the period that the audit is concluded. In other major jurisdictions where the Company conducts business, the years that remain open to tax audit go back to the year 2006. The Company believes it is possible that audits may be completed by tax authorities in some jurisdictions over the next twelve months. However, the Company is not able to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of any other future tax payments relating to uncertain tax positions. The Company classifies liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties as long-term liabilities. Interest expense and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax expense. The Company recognized after tax interest expense of $53 million , $60 million and $7 million in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. The total amount of accrued interest was $503 million and $436 million in 2018 and 2017 , respectively. 60 9. Employee Related Obligations At the end of 2018 and 2017 , employee related obligations recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were: (Dollars in Millions) 2018 2017 Pension benefits $ 5,327 5,343 Postretirement benefits 2,283 2,331 Postemployment benefits 2,330 2,250 Deferred compensation 410 475 Total employee obligations 10,350 10,399 Less current benefits payable 399 325 Employee related obligations — non-current $ 9,951 10,074 Prepaid employee related obligations of $475 million and $526 million for 2018 and 2017 , respectively, are included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 10. Pensions and Other Benefit Plans The Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit, defined contribution and termination indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide. The Company also provides post-retirement benefits, primarily health care, to all eligible U.S. retired employees and their dependents. Many international employees are covered by government-sponsored programs and the cost to the Company is not significant. Retirement plan benefits for employees hired before January 1, 2015 are primarily based on the employee’s compensation during the last three to five years before retirement and the number of years of service. In 2014, the Company announced that the U.S. Defined Benefit Plan was amended to adopt a new benefit formula, effective for employees hired on or after January 1, 2015. The benefits are calculated using a new formula based on employee compensation over total years of service. International subsidiaries have plans under which funds are deposited with trustees, annuities are purchased under group contracts, or reserves are provided. The Company does not typically fund retiree health care benefits in advance, but may do so at its discretion. The Company also has the right to modify these plans in the future. In 2018 and 2017 the Company used December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 , respectively, as the measurement date for all U.S. and international retirement and other benefit plans. Net periodic benefit costs for the Company’s defined benefit retirement plans and other benefit plans for 2018 , 2017 and 2016 include the following components: Retirement Plans Other Benefit Plans (Dollars in Millions) 2018 2017 2016 2018 2017 2016 Service cost $ 1,283 1,080 949 269 247 224 Interest cost 996 927 927 148 159 158 Expected return on plan assets (2,212 ) (2,041 ) (1,962 ) (7 ) (6 ) (6 ) Amortization of prior service cost (credit) 3 2 1 (31 ) (30 ) (34 ) Recognized actuarial losses 852 609 496 123 138 135 Curtailments and settlements 1 17 11 — — — Net periodic benefit cost $ 923 594 422 502 508 477 In 2018, as per the adoption of ASU 2017-07, the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost was presented in the same line items on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings where other employee compensation costs are reported. All other components of net periodic benefit cost are presented as part of Other (income) expense, net on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. 61 Amounts expected to be recognized in net periodic benefit cost in the coming year for the Company’s defined benefit retirement plans and other post-retirement plans: (Dollars in Millions) Amortization of net transition obligation $ — Amortization of net actuarial losses 656 Amortization of prior service credit 27 Unrecognized gains and losses for the U.S. pension plans are amortized over the average remaining future service for each plan. For plans with no active employees, they are amortized over the average life expectancy. The amortization of gains and losses for the other U.S. benefit plans is determined by using a 10% corridor of the greater of the market value of assets or the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation. Total unamortized gains and losses in excess of the corridor are amortized over the average remaining future service. Prior service costs/benefits for the U.S. pension plans are amortized over the average remaining future service of plan participants at the time of the plan amendment. Prior service cost/benefit for the other U.S. benefit plans is amortized over the average remaining service to full eligibility age of plan participants at the time of the plan amendment. The following table represents the weighted-average actuarial assumptions: Retirement Plans Other Benefit Plans Worldwide Benefit Plans 2018 2017 2016 2018 2017 2016 Net Periodic Benefit Cost Service cost discount rate 3.20 % 3.59 3.98 3.85 4.63 4.77 Interest cost discount rate 3.60 % 3.98 4.24 3.62 3.94 4.10 Rate of increase in compensation levels 3.98 % 4.01 4.02 4.29 4.31 4.32 Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets 8.46 % 8.43 8.55 Benefit Obligation Discount rate 3.76 % 3.30 3.78 4.40 3.78 4.42 Rate of increase in compensation levels 3.97 % 3.99 4.02 4.29 4.30 4.29 The Company’s discount rates are determined by considering current yield curves representing high quality, long-term fixed income instruments. The resulting discount rates are consistent with the duration of plan liabilities. In the fiscal year 2016, the Company changed its methodology in determining service and interest cost from the single weighted average discount rate approach to duration specific spot rates along that yield curve to the plans’ liability cash flows, which management has concluded is a more precise estimate. Prior to this change in methodology, the Company measured service and interest costs utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the plan obligations. The Company has accounted for this change as a change in accounting estimate and, accordingly, has accounted for it on a prospective basis. This change does not impact the benefit obligation and did not have a material impact to the 2016 full year results. The expected rates of return on plan asset assumptions represent the Company's assessment of long-term returns on diversified investment portfolios globally. The assessment is determined using projections from external financial sources, long-term historical averages, actual returns by asset class and the various asset class allocations by market. 62 The following table displays the assumed health care cost trend rates, for all individuals: Health Care Plans 2018 2017 Health care cost trend rate assumed for next year 6.12 % 6.33 % Rate to which the cost trend rate is assumed to decline (ultimate trend) 4.55 % 4.55 % Year the rate reaches the ultimate trend rate 2038 2038 A one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effect: One-Percentage- One-Percentage- (Dollars in Millions) Point Increase Point Decrease Health Care Plans Total interest and service cost $ 28 (22 ) Post-retirement benefit obligation $ 340 (280 ) 63 The following table sets forth information related to the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets at year-end 2018 and 2017 for the Company’s defined benefit retirement plans and other post-retirement plans: Retirement Plans Other Benefit Plans (Dollars in Millions) 2018 2017 2018 2017 Change in Benefit Obligation Projected benefit obligation — beginning of year $ 33,221 28,116 4,582 4,605 Service cost 1,283 1,080 269 247 Interest cost 996 927 148 159 Plan participant contributions 66 60 — — Amendments 26 (7 ) — (17 ) Actuarial (gains) losses (2,326 ) 2,996 (119 ) (166 ) Divestitures & acquisitions (29 ) 201 — 88 Curtailments, settlements & restructuring (21 ) (35 ) — 2 Benefits paid from plan (1,018 ) (1,050 ) (383 ) (351 ) Effect of exchange rates (528 ) 933 (17 ) 15 Projected benefit obligation — end of year $ 31,670 33,221 4,480 4,582 Change in Plan Assets Plan assets at fair value — beginning of year $ 28,404 23,633 281 75 Actual return on plan assets (1,269 ) 4,274 — 12 Company contributions 1,140 664 282 545 Plan participant contributions 66 60 — — Settlements (13 ) (32 ) — — Divestitures & acquisitions (17 ) 173 — — Benefits paid from plan assets (1,018 ) (1,050 ) (383 ) (351 ) Effect of exchange rates (475 ) 682 — — Plan assets at fair value — end of year $ 26,818 28,404 180 281 Funded status — end of year $ (4,852 ) (4,817 ) (4,300 ) (4,301 ) Amounts Recognized in the Company’s Balance Sheet consist of the following: Non-current assets $ 475 526 — — Current liabilities (98 ) (92 ) (281 ) (228 ) Non-current liabilities (5,229 ) (5,251 ) (4,019 ) (4,073 ) Total recognized in the consolidated balance sheet — end of year $ (4,852 ) (4,817 ) (4,300 ) (4,301 ) Amounts Recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income consist of the following: Net actuarial loss $ 8,323 8,140 1,263 1,500 Prior service cost (credit) 2 (25 ) (106 ) (137 ) Unrecognized net transition obligation — — — — Total before tax effects $ 8,325 8,115 1,157 1,363 Accumulated Benefit Obligations — end of year $ 28,533 29,793 64 Retirement Plans Other Benefit Plans (Dollars in Millions) 2018 2017 2018 2017 Amounts Recognized in Net Periodic Benefit Cost and Other Comprehensive Income Net periodic benefit cost $ 923 594 502 508 Net actuarial (gain) loss 1,153 740 (111 ) (169 ) Amortization of net actuarial loss (852 ) (609 ) (123 ) (138 ) Prior service cost (credit) 26 (7 ) — (17 ) Amortization of prior service (cost) credit (3 ) (2 ) 31 30 Effect of exchange rates (114 ) 256 (3 ) 3 Total loss/(income) recognized in other comprehensive income, before tax $ 210 378 (206 ) (291 ) Total recognized in net periodic benefit cost and other comprehensive income $ 1,133 972 296 217 The Company plans to continue to fund its U.S. Qualified Plans to comply with the Pension Protection Act of 2006. International Plans are funded in accordance with local regulations. Additional discretionary contributions are made when deemed appropriate to meet the long-term obligations of the plans. For certain plans, funding is not a common practice, as funding provides no economic benefit. Consequently, the Company has several pension plans that are not funded. In 2018 , the Company contributed $679 million and $461 million to its U.S. and international pension plans, respectively. The following table displays the funded status of the Company's U.S. Qualified & Non-Qualified pension plans and international funded and unfunded pension plans at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively: U.S. Plans International Plans Qualified Plans Non-Qualified Plans Funded Plans Unfunded Plans (Dollars in Millions) 2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 2017 Plan Assets $ 17,725 18,681 — — 9,093 9,723 — — Projected Benefit Obligation 18,609 19,652 2,176 2,257 10,467 10,863 418 449 Accumulated Benefit Obligation 16,851 17,654 1,793 1,849 9,510 9,893 379 397 Over (Under) Funded Status Projected Benefit Obligation $ (884 ) (971 ) (2,176 ) (2,257 ) (1,374 ) (1,140 ) (418 ) (449 ) Accumulated Benefit Obligation 874 1,027 (1,793 ) (1,849 ) (417 ) (170 ) (379 ) (397 ) Plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets have an accumulated benefit obligation, projected benefit obligation and plan assets of $7.5 billion , $8.8 billion and $4.3 billion , respectively, at the end of 2018 , and $3.8 billion , $4.6 billion and $0.7 billion , respectively, at the end of 2017 .

In determining investment policies, strategies and goals, each committee or board considers factors including, local pension rules and regulations; local tax regulations; availability of investment vehicles (separate accounts, commingled accounts, insurance funds, etc.); funded status of the plans; ratio of actives to retirees; duration of liabilities; and other relevant factors including: diversification, liquidity of local markets and liquidity of base currency. A majority of the Company’s pension funds are open to new entrants and are expected to be on-going plans. Permitted investments are primarily liquid and/or listed, with little reliance on illiquid and non-traditional investments such as hedge funds. The Company’s retirement plan asset allocation at the end of 2018 and 2017 and target allocations for 2019 are as follows: Percent of Plan Assets Target Allocation 2018 2017 2019 Worldwide Retirement Plans Equity securities 71 % 76 % 70 % Debt securities 29 24 30 Total plan assets 100 % 100 % 100 % Determination of Fair Value of Plan Assets The Plan has an established and well-documented process for determining fair values. Fair value is based upon quoted market prices, where available. If listed prices or quotes are not available, fair value is based upon models that primarily use, as inputs, market-based or independently sourced market parameters, including yield curves, interest rates, volatilities, equity or debt prices, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. While the Plan believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. Valuation Hierarchy The authoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels within the hierarchy are described in the table below with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest. A financial instrument’s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the investments measured at fair value. • Short-term investment funds — Cash and quoted short-term instruments are valued at the closing price or the amount held on deposit by the custodian bank. Other investments are through investment vehicles valued using the Net Asset Value (NAV) provided by the administrator of the fund. The NAV is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, minus its liabilities, and then divided by the number of shares outstanding. The NAV is a quoted price in a market that is not active and classified as Level 2. • Government and agency securities — A limited number of these investments are valued at the closing price reported on the major market on which the individual securities are traded. Where quoted prices are available in an active market, the investments are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. If quoted market prices are not available for the specific security, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows. When quoted market prices for a security are not available in an active market, they are classified as Level 2. • Debt instruments — A limited number of these investments are valued at the closing price reported on the major market on which the individual securities are traded. Where quoted prices are available in an active market, the investments are classified as Level 1. If quoted market prices are not available for the specific security, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows and are classified as Level 2. Level 3 debt instruments are priced based on unobservable inputs. • Equity securities — Equity securities are valued at the closing price reported on the major market on which the individual securities are traded. Substantially all common stock is classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. • Commingled funds — These investment vehicles are valued using the NAV provided by the fund administrator. The NAV is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, minus its liabilities, and then divided by the number of shares outstanding. Assets in the Level 2 category have a quoted market price. 66 • Insurance contracts — The instruments are issued by insurance companies. The fair value is based on negotiated value and the underlying investments held in separate account portfolios as well as considering the credit worthiness of the issuer. The underlying investments are government, asset-backed and fixed income securities. In general, insurance contracts are classified as Level 3 as there are no quoted prices nor other observable inputs for pricing. • Other assets — Other assets are represented primarily by limited partnerships and real estate investments, as well as commercial loans and commercial mortgages that are not classified as corporate debt. Other assets that are exchange listed and actively traded are classified as Level 1, while inactively traded assets are classified as Level 2. The following table sets forth the Retirement Plans' investments measured at fair value as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017: Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets Significant Other Observable Inputs Significant Unobservable Inputs (a) Investments Measured at Net Asset Value (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Total Assets (Dollars in Millions) 2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 2017 Short-term investment funds $ 122 429 529 427 — — — — 651 856 Government and agency securities — — 3,595 3,094 — — — — 3,595 3,094 Debt instruments — — 3,105 2,013 — — — — 3,105 2,013 Equity securities 11,298 13,848 4 — — — — — 11,302 13,848 Commingled funds — — 2,304 1,780 133 57 5,201 6,158 7,638 7,995 Insurance contracts — — — — 193 199 — — 193 199 Other assets — — 33 121 — — 301 278 334 399 Investments at fair value $ 11,420 14,277 9,570 7,435 326 256 5,502 6,436 26,818 28,404 (a) The activity for the Level 3 assets is not significant for all years presented. The Company's Other Benefit Plans are unfunded except for U.S. commingled funds (Level 2) of $72 million and $81 million and U.S. short-term investment funds (Level 2) of $108 million and $200 million at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The fair value of Johnson & Johnson Common Stock directly held in plan assets was $876 million ( 3.3% of total plan assets) at December 31, 2018 and $938 million ( 3.3% of total plan assets) at December 31, 2017. 11. Savings Plan The Company has voluntary 401(k) savings plans designed to enhance the existing retirement programs covering eligible employees. The Company matches a percentage of each employee’s contributions consistent with the provisions of the plan for which he/she is eligible. Total Company matching contributions to the plans were $242 million , $214 million and $191 million in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. 67 12. Capital and Treasury Stock Changes in treasury stock were: Treasury Stock (Amounts in Millions Except Treasury Stock Shares in Thousands) Shares Amount Balance at January 3, 2016 364,681 $ 22,684 Employee compensation and stock option plans (30,839 ) (3,311 ) Repurchase of common stock 79,490 8,979 Balance at January 1, 2017 413,332 28,352 Employee compensation and stock option plans (25,508 ) (3,156 ) Repurchase of common stock 49,494 6,358 Balance at December 31, 2017 437,318 31,554 Employee compensation and stock option plans (22,082 ) (3,060 ) Repurchase of common stock 42,283 5,868 Balance at December 30, 2018 457,519 $ 34,362 Aggregate shares of common stock issued were approximately 3,119,843,000 shares at the end of 2018 , 2017 and 2016 . Cash dividends paid were $3.54 per share in 2018 , compared with dividends of $3.32 per share in 2017 , and $3.15 per share in 2016 . On December 17, 2018, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program, authorizing the Company to purchase up to $5.0 billion of the Company's shares of common stock. The repurchase program has no time limit and may be suspended for periods or discontinued at any time. Any shares acquired will be available for general corporate purposes. The Company intends to finance the share repurchase program through available cash. As of December 30, 2018, $0.9 billion has been repurchased under the program. On October 13, 2015, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program, authorizing the Company to purchase up to $10.0 billion of the Company's shares of common stock. This share repurchase program was completed as of July 2, 2017. 13. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) Components of other comprehensive income (loss) consist of the following: (Dollars in Millions) Foreign Currency Translation Gain/(Loss) On Securities Employee Benefit Plans Gain/ (Loss) On Derivatives & Hedges Total Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) January 3, 2016 $ (8,435 ) 604 (5,298 ) (36 ) (13,165 ) Net 2016 changes (612 ) (193 ) (682 ) (249 ) (1,736 ) January 1, 2017 (9,047 ) 411 (5,980 ) (285 ) (14,901 ) Net 2017 changes 1,696 (179 ) (170 ) 355 1,702 December 31, 2017 (7,351 ) 232 (6,150 ) 70 (13,199 ) Cumulative adjustment to retained earnings (232 ) (1) (232 ) Net 2018 changes (1,518 ) — (8 ) (265 ) (1,791 ) December 30, 2018 $ (8,869 ) — (6,158 ) (195 ) (15,222 ) (1) See Note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on the adoption of ASU 2016-01 Amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income are presented net of the related tax impact. Foreign currency translation is not adjusted for income taxes where it relates to permanent investments in international subsidiaries. For additional details on comprehensive income see the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Details on reclassifications out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income: Gain/(Loss) On Securities - reclassifications released to Other (income) expense, net. 68 Employee Benefit Plans - reclassifications are included in net periodic benefit cost. See Note 10 for additional details. Gain/(Loss) On Derivatives & Hedges - reclassifications to earnings are recorded in the same account as the hedged transaction. See Note 6 for additional details. 14. International Currency Translation For translation of its subsidiaries operating in non-U.S. Dollar currencies, the Company has determined that the local currencies of its international subsidiaries are the functional currencies except those in highly inflationary economies, which are defined as those which have had compound cumulative rates of inflation of 100% or more during the past three years , or where a substantial portion of its cash flows are not in the local currency. Beginning in the fiscal third quarter of 2018, the Company accounted for operations in Argentina as highly inflationary. For the majority of the Company's subsidiaries the local currency is the functional currency. In consolidating international subsidiaries, balance sheet currency effects are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. This equity account includes the results of translating certain balance sheet assets and liabilities at current exchange rates and some accounts at historical rates, except for those located in highly inflationary economies. The translation of balance sheet accounts for highly inflationary economies are reflected in the operating results. A rollforward of the changes during 2018 , 2017 and 2016 for foreign currency translation adjustments is included in Note 13. Net currency transaction gains and losses included in Other (income) expense were losses of $265 million , $216 million and $289 million in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. 15. Earnings Per Share The following is a reconciliation of basic net earnings per share to diluted net earnings per share for the fiscal years ended December 30, 2018 , December 31, 2017 and January 1, 2017 : (In Millions Except Per Share Amounts) 2018 2017 2016 Basic net earnings per share $ 5.70 0.48 6.04 Average shares outstanding — basic 2,681.5 2,692.0 2,737.3 Potential shares exercisable under stock option plans 139.0 139.7 142.4 Less: shares repurchased under treasury stock method (92.5 ) (87.3 ) (92.1 ) Convertible debt shares 0.7 0.9 1.3 Adjusted average shares outstanding — diluted 2,728.7 2,745.3 2,788.9 Diluted net earnings per share $ 5.61 0.47 5.93 The diluted net earnings per share calculation included the dilutive effect of convertible debt that is offset by the related reduction in interest expense of $1 million after-tax for 2018 and 2017, and $2 million for 2016. The diluted net earnings per share calculation for 2018, 2017 and 2016 included all shares related to stock options, as the exercise price of all options was less than the average market value of the Company's stock. 16. Rental Expense and Lease Commitments Rentals of space, vehicles, manufacturing equipment and office and data processing equipment under operating leases were approximately $332 million , $372 million and $330 million in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. The approximate minimum rental payments required under operating leases that have initial or remaining non-cancelable lease terms in excess of one year at December 30, 2018 are: (Dollars in Millions) 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 After 2023 Total $223 188 154 116 76 139 896 Commitments under capital leases are not significant. 69 17. Common Stock, Stock Option Plans and Stock Compensation Agreements At December 30, 2018 , the Company had 2 stock-based compensation plans. The shares outstanding are for contracts under the Company's 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan and the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan. The 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan expired April 26, 2012. All options and restricted shares granted subsequent to that date were under the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan. Under the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan, the Company may issue up to 650 million shares of common stock, plus any shares canceled, expired, forfeited, or not issued from the 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan subsequent to April 26, 2012. Shares available for future grants under the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan were 351 million at the end of 2018 . The compensation cost that has been charged against income for these plans was $978 million , $962 million and $878 million for 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. The total income tax benefit recognized in the income statement for share-based compensation costs was $192 million , $275 million and $256 million for 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. An additional tax benefit of $353 million was recognized in 2016 due to the adoption of a new accounting standard for the reporting of additional tax benefits on share-based compensation. The total unrecognized compensation cost was $827 million , $798 million and $749 million for 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. The weighted average period for this cost to be recognized was 1.73 years, 1.76 years and 1.09 years for 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 , respectively. Share-based compensation costs capitalized as part of inventory were insignificant in all periods. The Company settles employee benefit equity issuances with treasury shares. Treasury shares are replenished throughout the year for the number of shares used to settle employee benefit equity issuances. Stock Options Stock options expire 10 years from the date of grant and vest over service periods that range from 6 months to 4 years . All options are granted at the average of the high and low prices of the Company’s Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of grant. The fair value of each option award was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model that uses the assumptions noted in the following table. For 2018, 2017 and 2016 grants, expected volatility represents a blended rate of 10-year weekly historical overall volatility rate, and a 5-week average implied volatility rate based on at-the-money traded Johnson & Johnson options with a life of 2 years. For all grants, historical data is used to determine the expected life of the option. The risk-free rate was based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The average fair value of options granted was $17.98 , $13.38 and $10.01 , in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. The fair value was estimated based on the weighted average assumptions of: 2018 2017 2016 Risk-free rate 2.77 % 2.25 % 1.51 % Expected volatility 15.77 % 15.30 % 15.76 % Expected life (in years) 7.0 7.0 7.0 Expected dividend yield 2.70 % 2.90 % 3.10 % A summary of option activity under the Plan as of December 30, 2018 , December 31, 2017 and January 1, 2017 , and changes during the years ending on those dates is presented below: 70 (Shares in Thousands) Outstanding Shares Weighted Average Exercise Price Aggregate Intrinsic Value (Dollars in Millions) Shares at January 3, 2016 116,517 $ 76.41 $ 3,065 Options granted 22,491 101.87 Options exercised (22,547 ) 65.66 Options canceled/forfeited (3,006 ) 92.83 Shares at January 1, 2017 113,455 83.16 3,636 Options granted 19,287 115.67 Options exercised (18,975 ) 70.87 Options canceled/forfeited (2,461 ) 101.40 Shares at December 31, 2017 111,306 90.48 5,480 Options granted 17,115 129.51 Options exercised (16,228 ) 75.44 Options canceled/forfeited (2,541 ) 112.90 Shares at December 30, 2018 109,652 $ 98.29 $ 3,214 The total intrinsic value of options exercised was $1,028 million , $1,060 million and $980 million in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. The following table summarizes stock options outstanding and exercisable at December 30, 2018 : (Shares in Thousands) Outstanding Exercisable Exercise Price Range Options Average Life (1) Average Exercise Price Options Average Exercise Price $52.13-$65.62 13,466 1.8 $62.67 13,466 $62.67 $66.07-$72.54 12,710 4.0 $72.53 12,710 $72.53 $90.44-$100.48 29,162 5.6 $95.34 28,537 $95.23 $101.87-$115.67 37,877 7.6 $108.33 111 $108.04 $115.68-$129.51 16,437 9.1 $129.51 38 $129.51 109,652 6.2 $98.29 54,862 $82.03 (1) Average contractual life remaining in years. Stock options outstanding at December 31, 2017 and January 1, 2017 were 111,306 and an average life of 6.3 years and 113,455 and an average life of 6.2 years, respectively. Stock options exercisable at December 31, 2017 and January 1, 2017 were 52,421 at an average price of $73.61 and 50,414 at an average price of $65.77 , respectively. Restricted Share Units and Performance Share Units The Company grants restricted share units which vest over service periods that range from 6 months to 3 years . The Company also grants performance share units, which are paid in shares of Johnson & Johnson Common Stock after the end of a three -year performance period. Whether any performance share units vest, and the amount that does vest, is tied to the completion of service periods that range from 6 months to 3 years and the achievement, over a three -year period, of three equally-weighted goals that directly align with or help drive long-term total shareholder return: operational sales, adjusted operational earnings per share, and relative total shareholder return. The number of shares actually earned at the end of the three -year period will vary, based only on actual performance, from 0% to 200% of the target number of performance share units granted . In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company modified the restricted share units that are scheduled to vest between January 1, 2018 and March 15, 2018. This modification guaranteed a minimum aggregate value, below the market value of the total expected payout amount, for all awards expected to vest during this period.

The 2018 acquisitions primarily included: Zarbee’s, Inc., a privately held company that is a leader in naturally-based consumer healthcare products; Medical Enterprises Distribution LLC, a privately held healthcare technology firm focused on surgical procedure innovation; BeneVir Biopharm, Inc. (BeneVir), a privately-held, biopharmaceutical company specializing in the development of oncolytic immunotherapies and Orthotaxy, a privately-held developer of software-enabled surgery technologies, including a differentiated robotic-assisted surgery solution. The excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired amounted to $1.0 billion and has been assigned to identifiable intangible assets, with any residual recorded to goodwill. On October 23, 2018, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire Ci:z Holdings Co., Ltd., a Japanese company focused on the marketing, development and distribution of a broad range of dermocosmetic, cosmetic and skincare products for a total purchase price of approximately ¥230 billion , which equates to approximately $2.1 billion , using the exchange rate of 109.06 Japanese Yen to each U.S. Dollar on January 16, 2019. The acquisition was completed on January 17, 2019, through a series of transactions that included an all-cash tender offer to acquire the publicly held shares not already held by the Company for ¥5,900 per share. Upon completion of the tender offer and the related transactions, the Company acquired 89% of the outstanding shares. The Company plans to acquire the remaining shares that were not tendered in the tender offer through a share consolidation under Japanese law during the first half of 2019 and take appropriate actions to delist from the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The acquisition will include the range of brands comprising DR.CI:LABO, LABO LABO and GENOMER line of skincare products. The Company expects to treat this transaction as a business combination and will include it in the Consumer segment. On February 13, 2019, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Auris Health, Inc. for approximately $3.4 billion in cash. Additional contingent payments of up to $2.35 billion , in the aggregate, may be payable upon reaching certain predetermined milestones. Auris Health is a privately held developer of robotic technologies, initially focused in lung cancer, with an FDA-cleared platform currently used in bronchoscopic diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. The closing is subject to antitrust clearance and other customary closing conditions. The transaction is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2019. The Company expects to treat this transaction as a business combination and will include it in the Medical Devices segment. During 2017 certain businesses were acquired for $35.2 billion in cash and $1.8 billion of liabilities assumed. These acquisitions were accounted for using the acquisition method and, accordingly, results of operations have been included in the financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition. The 2017 acquisitions primarily included: Actelion Ltd, an established leading franchise of differentiated, innovative products for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH); Abbott Medical Optics (AMO), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Abbott Laboratories, which included ophthalmic products related to: cataract surgery, laser refractive surgery and consumer eye health; Neuravi Limited, a privately-held medical device company that develops and markets medical devices for neurointerventional therapy; TearScience Inc., a manufacturer of products dedicated to treating meibomian gland dysfunction; Sightbox, Inc., a privately-held company that developed a subscription vision care service that connects consumers with eye care professionals and a supply of contact lenses; Torax Medical, Inc., a privately-held medical device company that manufactures and markets the LINX™ Reflux Management System for the surgical treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease and Megadyne Medical Products, Inc., a privately-held medical device company that develops, manufactures and markets electrosurgical tools. The excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired amounted to $34.4 billion and has been assigned to identifiable intangible assets, with any residual recorded to goodwill. Of this amount, approximately $1.1 billion has been identified as the value of IPR&D, primarily associated with the acquisition of Actelion Ltd. The value of the IPR&D was calculated using cash flow projections discounted for the inherent risk in the projects. During 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of Actelion Ltd through an all cash tender offer in Switzerland for $280 per share, amounting to $29.6 billion , net of cash acquired. As part of the transaction, immediately prior to the completion of the acquisition, Actelion spun out its drug discovery operations and early-stage clinical development assets into a newly created Swiss biopharmaceutical company, Idorsia Ltd. The shares of Idorsia are listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange (SIX). In 2017 the Company held 9.9% of the shares of Idorsia and had rights to an additional 22.1% of Idorsia equity through a convertible loan with a principal amount of approximately $0.5 billion . As a result of Idorsia raising additional capital in July 2018, the Company currently holds 9.0% of the shares of Idorsia and has rights to an additional 20.8% of Idorsia equity through a convertible loan with a principal amount of approximately $0.5 billion . The convertible loan may be converted into Idorsia shares as follows: (i) up to an aggregate shareholding of 16% of Idorsia shares as a result of certain shareholders holding more than 20% of the issued Idorsia shares, and (ii) up to the balance of the remaining amount within 20 business days of the maturity date of the convertible loan, which has a 10 year term, or if Idorsia undergoes a change of control transaction. The investment in Idorsia was recorded as a cost method investment in Other assets in the Company's consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company also exercised the option acquired on ACT-132577, a product within Idorsia being developed for resistant hypertension currently in phase 2 of clinical development. The Company has also entered into an agreement to provide Idorsia 81 with a Swiss franc denominated credit facility of approximately $250 million . As of December 30, 2018, Idorsia has not made any draw-downs under the credit facility. Actelion has entered into a transitional services agreement with Idorsia. Actelion has established a leading franchise of differentiated, innovative products for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) that are highly complementary to the existing portfolio of the Company. The addition of Actelion’s specialty in-market medicines and late-stage products is consistent with the Company's efforts to grow in attractive and complementary therapeutic areas and serve patients with serious illnesses and significant unmet medical need. During the fiscal second quarter of 2018, the Company finalized the purchase price allocation to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed using the acquisition method. The following table presents the amounts recognized for assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date with adjustments made through the second quarter of 2018: (Dollars in Millions) Cash & Cash equivalents 469 Inventory (1) 759 Accounts Receivable 485 Other current assets 93 Property, plant and equipment 104 Goodwill 6,161 Intangible assets 25,010 Deferred Taxes 99 Other non-current assets 19 Total Assets Acquired 33,199 Current liabilities 956 Deferred Taxes 1,776 Other non-current liabilities 413 Total Liabilities Assumed 3,145 Net Assets Acquired 30,054 (1) Includes adjustment of $642 million to write-up the acquired inventory to its estimated fair value. The adjustments made since the date of acquisition were $0.2 billion to the deferred taxes and $0.4 billion to the current liabilities with the offset to goodwill. The assets acquired are recorded in the Pharmaceutical segment. The acquisition of Actelion resulted in approximately $6.2 billion of goodwill. The goodwill is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise from the acquisition. The goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The purchase price allocation to the identifiable intangible assets is as follows: (Dollars in Millions) Intangible assets with definite lives: Patents and trademarks* $ 24,230 Total amortizable intangibles 24,230 In-process research and development 780 Total intangible assets $ 25,010 *Includes $0.4 billion related to VALCHLOR ® , one of the acquired products, which was divested in the fiscal second quarter of 2018. The patents and trademarks acquired are comprised of developed technology with a weighted average life of 9 years and was primarily based on the patent life of the marketed products. The intangible assets with definite lives were assigned asset lives ranging from 4 to 10 years . The in-process research and development intangible assets were valued for technology programs for unapproved products. The value of the IPR&D was calculated using probability adjusted cash flow projections discounted for the risk inherent in such projects. The discount rate applied was 9% . 82 The acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method and, accordingly, the results of operations of Actelion were reported in the Company's financial statements beginning on June 16, 2017, the date of acquisition. For the year ended December 31, 2017, total sales and a net loss for Actelion from the date of acquisition were $1.4 billion and $1.4 billion , respectively. The following table provides pro forma results of operations for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 and January 1, 2017, as if Actelion had been acquired as of January 4, 2016. The pro forma results include the effect of certain purchase accounting adjustments such as the estimated changes in depreciation and amortization expense on the acquired tangible and intangible assets. However, pro forma results do not include any anticipated cost savings or other effects of the planned integration of Actelion. Accordingly, such amounts are not necessarily indicative of the results if the acquisition had occurred on the dates indicated or which may occur in the future. Unaudited Pro forma Consolidated Results (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Data) 2017 2016 Net Sales 77,681 74,339 Net Earnings 1,509 13,916 Diluted Net Earnings per Common Share 0.55 4.99 The Company recorded Actelion acquisition related costs before tax of approximately $0.2 billion and $0.8 billion in 2018 and 2017, respectively, which was recorded in Other (income)/expense and Cost of products sold. During 2017, the Company acquired Abbott Medical Optics (AMO), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Abbott Laboratories, for $4.3 billion , net of cash acquired. The acquisition included ophthalmic products related to: cataract surgery, laser refractive surgery and consumer eye health. The net purchase price was primarily recorded as amortizable intangible assets for $2.3 billion and goodwill for $1.7 billion . The weighted average life of total amortizable intangibles, the majority being customer relationships, is approximately 14.4 years . The goodwill is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise from the business acquisition and is not deductible for tax purposes. The intangible assets and goodwill amounts are based on the final purchase price allocation. The assets acquired were recorded in the Medical Devices segment. Certain businesses were acquired for $4.5 billion in cash and $0.1 billion of liabilities assumed during 2016. These acquisitions were accounted for using the acquisition method and, accordingly, results of operations have been included in the financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition. The 2016 acquisitions primarily included: Vogue International LLC, a privately-held company focused on the marketing, development and distribution of salon-influenced and nature inspired hair care and other personal products; NeuWave Medical, Inc., a privately-held medical device company that manufactures and markets minimally invasive soft tissue microwave ablation systems; NeoStrata Company, Inc., a global leader in dermocosmetics; and the global rights for the commercialization of RHINOCORT ® allergy spray outside the United States. The excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired amounted to $4.1 billion and has been assigned to identifiable intangible assets, with any residual recorded to goodwill. The net purchase price for Vogue International LLC of $3.3 billion was primarily recorded as amortizable intangible assets for $2.3 billion and goodwill for $1.1 billion . The weighted average life for the $2.3 billion of total amortizable intangibles is approximately 22 years . The trademark asset values were determined to have definite lives ranging from 10 to 22 years, with the majority being 22 years. The goodwill is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise from the business acquisition and is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The assets acquired were recorded in the Consumer segment. In 2012, the Company completed the acquisition of Synthes, Inc. for a purchase price of $20.2 billion in cash and stock. In connection with the acquisition of Synthes, Inc. the Company entered into two accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreements. In 2013, the Company settled the remaining liabilities under the ASR agreements. While the Company believes that the transactions under each ASR agreement and a series of related internal transactions were consummated in a tax efficient manner in accordance with applicable law, it is possible that the Internal Revenue Service could assert one or more contrary positions to challenge the transactions from a tax perspective. If challenged, an amount up to the total purchase price for the Synthes shares could be treated as subject to applicable U.S. tax at approximately the statutory rate to the Company, plus interest. With the exception of the Actelion Ltd acquisition, supplemental pro forma information for 2018, 2017 and 2016 in accordance with U.S. GAAP standards related to business combinations, and goodwill and other intangible assets, is not provided, as the impact of the aforementioned acquisitions did not have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position. During 2018, the Company divested the LifeScan Inc business for approximately $2.1 billion and retained certain net liabilities. Other divestitures in 2018 included: NIZORAL ® , RoC ® and certain non-strategic Pharmaceutical products. In 2018, the pre-tax gains on the divestitures were approximately $1.2 billion . Additionally, in 2018, the Company accepted the binding 83 offer from Fortive Corporation to acquire its Advanced Sterilization Products (ASP) business for approximately $2.7 billion , subject to customary adjustments. The transaction is expected to close in 2019. As of December 30, 2018, the assets held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheet were $0.2 billion of inventory, $0.1 billion of property, plant and equipment and $0.3 billion of goodwill. The Company will retain certain net receivables of approximately $0.1 billion associated with the ASP business. In 2018, the Company accepted a binding offer to form a strategic collaboration with Jabil Inc., one of the world’s leading manufacturing services providers for health care products and technology products. The Company is expanding a 12-year relationship with Jabil to produce a range of products within the Ethicon Endo-Surgery and DePuy Synthes businesses. This transaction includes the transfer of employees and manufacturing sites. As of December 30, 2018, the assets held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheet were $0.3 billion of inventory and $0.1 billion of property, plant and equipment, net. For additional details on the global supply chain restructuring see Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. During 2017, the Company divestitures primarily included: the Codman Neurosurgery business, to Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation and the divestiture of COMPEED ® to HRA Pharma. In 2017, the pre-tax gains on the divestitures were approximately $1.3 billion . During 2016, the Company divestitures included: the controlled substance raw material and active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) business; certain anesthetic products in Europe; and certain non-strategic Consumer brands. In 2016, the pre-tax gains on the divestitures were approximately $0.6 billion . 21. Legal Proceedings Johnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial, supplier indemnification and other matters; governmental investigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of their business. The Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of December 30, 2018 , the Company has determined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal issue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance with ASC 450-20-25. For these and other litigation and regulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts already accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors, including whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; or there are numerous parties involved. In the Company's opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with counsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company's balance sheet, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position. However, the resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and cash flows for that period. PRODUCT LIABILITY Johnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in numerous product liability claims and lawsuits involving multiple products. Claimants in these cases seek substantial compensatory and, where available, punitive damages. While the Company believes it has substantial defenses, it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation. The Company has established accruals for product liability claims and lawsuits in compliance with ASC 450-20 based on currently available information, which in some cases may be limited. The Company accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to defend each matter when those costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. For certain of these matters, the Company has accrued additional amounts such as estimated costs associated with settlements, damages and other losses. To the extent adverse verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated. Product liability accruals can represent projected product liability for thousands of claims around the world, each in different litigation environments and with different fact patterns. Changes to the accruals may be required in the future as additional information becomes available. The most significant of these cases include: the DePuy ASR™ XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR™ Hip Resurfacing System; the PINNACLE ® Acetabular Cup System; pelvic meshes; RISPERDAL ® ; XARELTO ® ; body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSONS ® Baby Powder; INVOKANA ® ; and ETHICON PHYSIOMESH ® Flexible Composite Mesh. As of December 30, 2018 , in the United States there were approximately 1,800 plaintiffs with direct claims in pending lawsuits 84 regarding injuries allegedly due to the DePuy ASR™ XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR™ Hip Resurfacing System; 10,500 with respect to the PINNACLE ® Acetabular Cup System; 34,800 with respect to pelvic meshes; 13,400 with respect to RISPERDAL ® ; 25,600 with respect to XARELTO ® ; 13,000 with respect to body powders containing talc; 1,050 with respect to INVOKANA ® ; and 2,100 with respect to ETHICON PHYSIOMESH ® Flexible Composite Mesh. In August 2010, DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. (DePuy) announced a worldwide voluntary recall of its ASR ™ XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR ™ Hip Resurfacing System used in hip replacement surgery. Claims for personal injury have been made against DePuy and Johnson & Johnson. The number of pending lawsuits is expected to fluctuate as certain lawsuits are settled or dismissed and additional lawsuits are filed. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. Litigation has also been filed in countries outside of the United States, primarily in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Ireland, Germany and Italy. In November 2013, DePuy reached an agreement with a Court-appointed committee of lawyers representing ASR Hip System plaintiffs to establish a program to settle claims with eligible ASR Hip patients in the United States who had surgery to replace their ASR Hips, known as revision surgery, as of August 31, 2013. DePuy reached additional agreements in February 2015 and March 2017, which further extended the settlement program to include ASR Hip patients who had revision surgeries after August 31, 2013 and prior to February 15, 2017. This settlement program has resolved more than 10,000 claims, therefore bringing to resolution significant ASR Hip litigation activity in the United States. However, lawsuits in the United States remain, and the settlement program does not address litigation outside of the United States. In Australia, a class action settlement was reached that resolved the claims of the majority of ASR Hip patients in that country. In Canada, the Company has reached agreements to settle two pending class actions which have been approved by the Québec Superior Court and the Supreme Court of British Columbia. The British Columbia order is currently the subject of an appeal. The Company continues to receive information with respect to potential additional costs associated with this recall on a worldwide basis. The Company has established accruals for the costs associated with the United States settlement program and DePuy ASR ™ Hip-related product liability litigation. Claims for personal injury have also been made against DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. and Johnson & Johnson (collectively, DePuy) relating to the PINNACLE ® Acetabular Cup System used in hip replacement surgery. The number of pending product liability lawsuits continues to increase, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas. Litigation has also been filed in some state courts and in countries outside of the United States. Several adverse verdicts have been rendered against DePuy, one of which was reversed on appeal and remanded for retrial, the second remains under appeal and the third is pending decision on post-trial motions in the district court. The Company has established an accrual for product liability litigation associated with the PINNACLE ® Acetabular Cup System. The Company is negotiating settlements of these cases and the related costs are reflected in the Company’s accruals. Claims for personal injury have been made against Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon) and Johnson & Johnson arising out of Ethicon's pelvic mesh devices used to treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. The Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and additional cases. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia. The Company has settled or otherwise resolved a majority of the United States cases and the costs associated with these settlements are reflected in the Company's accruals. In addition, class actions and individual personal injury cases or claims have been commenced in various countries outside of the United States, including claims and cases in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Belgium, and class actions in Israel, Australia and Canada, seeking damages for alleged injury resulting from Ethicon's pelvic mesh devices. In Australia, a trial of class action issues has been completed and the parties are awaiting a decision. The Company has established accruals with respect to product liability litigation associated with Ethicon's pelvic mesh products. Following a June 2016 worldwide market withdrawal of ETHICON PHYSIOMESH ® Flexible Composite Mesh, claims for personal injury have been made against Ethicon, Inc. and Johnson & Johnson alleging personal injury arising out of the use of this hernia mesh device. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. A multi county litigation (MCL) has also been formed in New Jersey state court and assigned to Atlantic County for cases pending in New Jersey. Product liability lawsuits continue to be filed, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. The Company has established accruals with respect to product liability litigation associated with ETHICON PHYSIOMESH ® Flexible Composite Mesh. Claims for personal injury have been made against Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Johnson & Johnson arising out of the use of RISPERDAL ® , indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia, acute manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I 85 disorder and irritability associated with autism, and related compounds. Lawsuits have been primarily filed in state courts in Pennsylvania, California, and Missouri. Other actions are pending in various courts in the United States and Canada. Product liability lawsuits continue to be filed, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. The Company has settled or otherwise resolved many of the United States cases and the costs associated with these settlements are reflected in the Company's accruals. Claims for personal injury arising out of the use of XARELTO ® , an oral anticoagulant, have been made against Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI); Johnson & Johnson; and JPI's collaboration partner for XARELTO ® Bayer AG and certain of its affiliates. The number of pending product liability lawsuits continues to increase, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. In addition, cases have been filed in state courts across the United States. Many of these cases have been consolidated into a state mass tort litigation in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and there are coordinated proceedings in Delaware, California and Missouri. Class action lawsuits also have been filed in Canada. The Company has established an accrual for defense costs only in connection with product liability litigation associated with XARELTO ® . Personal injury claims alleging that talc causes cancer have been made against Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. and Johnson & Johnson arising out of the use of body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSONS ® Baby Powder. The number of pending product liability lawsuits continues to increase, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. Lawsuits have been primarily filed in state courts in Missouri, New Jersey and California. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. The Company has successfully defended a number of these cases but there have been verdicts against the Company, including a verdict in July 2018 of $4.7 billion . The Company believes that it has strong grounds on appeal to overturn these verdicts. The Company has established an accrual for defense costs only in connection with product liability litigation associated with body powders containing talc. In February 2018, a securities class action lawsuit was filed against Johnson & Johnson and certain named officers in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging that Johnson & Johnson violated the federal securities laws by failing to adequately disclose the alleged asbestos contamination in body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON'S ® Baby Powder, and that purchasers of Johnson & Johnson’s shares suffered losses as a result. Plaintiffs are seeking damages. In October 2018, a shareholder derivative lawsuit was filed against Johnson & Johnson as the nominal defendant and its current directors as defendants in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging a breach of fiduciary duties related to the alleged asbestos contamination in body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S ® Baby Powder, and that Johnson & Johnson has suffered damages as a result of those alleged breaches. Plaintiff is seeking damages and an order for the Company to reform its internal policies and procedures. In January 2019, two ERISA class action lawsuits were filed by participants in the Johnson & Johnson Savings Plan against Johnson & Johnson, its Pension and Benefits Committee, and certain named officers in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by offering Johnson & Johnson stock as a Johnson & Johnson Savings Plan investment option when it was imprudent to do so because of failures to disclose alleged asbestos contamination in body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S ® Baby Powder. Plaintiffs are seeking damages and injunctive relief. Each of these matters will be adjudicated in conjunction with the multi-district litigation referenced in the prior paragraph. In addition, the Company has received preliminary inquiries and subpoenas to produce documents regarding these matters from Senator Murray, a member of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company is cooperating with these government inquiries and will be producing documents in response. Claims for personal injury have been made against a number of Johnson & Johnson companies, including Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Johnson & Johnson, arising out of the use of INVOKANA ® , a prescription medication indicated to improve glycemic control in adults with Type 2 diabetes. Lawsuits filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. Cases have also been filed in state courts in Pennsylvania, California and New Jersey. Class action lawsuits have been filed in Canada. Product liability lawsuits continue to be filed, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. The Company has settled or otherwise resolved many of the cases and claims in the United States and the costs associated with these settlements are reflected in the Company's accruals. 86 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY Certain subsidiaries of Johnson & Johnson are subject, from time to time, to legal proceedings and claims related to patent, trademark and other intellectual property matters arising out of their businesses. Many of these matters involve challenges to the coverage and/or validity of the patents on various products and allegations that certain of the Company’s products infringe the patents of third parties. Although these subsidiaries believe that they have substantial defenses to these challenges and allegations with respect to all significant patents, there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these matters. A loss in any of these cases could adversely affect the ability of these subsidiaries to sell their products, result in loss of sales due to loss of market exclusivity, require the payment of past damages and future royalties, and may result in a non-cash impairment charge for any associated intangible asset. The most significant of these matters are described below. Medical Devices In June 2009, Rembrandt Vision Technologies, L.P. (Rembrandt) filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Johnson & Johnson Vision Care, Inc. (JJVCI) in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging that JJVCI's manufacture and sale of its ACUVUE ® ADVANCE and ACUVUE OASYS ® Hydrogel Contact Lenses infringed Rembrandt’s United States Patent No. 5,712,327 and seeking monetary relief. The case was transferred to the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, where a trial in May 2012 resulted in a verdict of non-infringement that was subsequently upheld on appeal. In July 2014, Rembrandt sought a new trial based on alleged new evidence, which the district court denied. In April 2016, the Court of Appeals overturned that ruling and remanded the case to the district court for a new trial. A new trial was held in August 2017, and the jury returned a verdict of non-infringement in favor of JJVCI. Rembrandt has appealed the verdict to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC). In February 2019, the CAFC affirmed the judgment in favor of JJVCI. In March 2013, Medinol Ltd. (Medinol) filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Cordis Corporation (Cordis) and Johnson & Johnson in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that Cordis’s sales of the CYPHER ™ and CYPHER SELECT ™ stents made in the United States since 2005 willfully infringed four of Medinol's patents directed to the geometry of articulated stents. Medinol is seeking damages and attorneys’ fees. Although Johnson & Johnson has since sold Cordis, it has retained liability for this case. After trial in January 2014, the district court dismissed the case, finding Medinol unreasonably delayed bringing its claims (the laches defense). In September 2014, the district court denied a motion by Medinol to vacate the judgment and grant it a new trial. Medinol appealed the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In March 2017, the United States Supreme Court held that the laches defense is not available in patent cases. In April 2018, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit remanded the case back to the district court to reconsider Medinol’s motion for a new trial, and briefing in the district court was completed in June 2018. In November 2016, MedIdea, L.L.C. (MedIdea) filed a patent infringement lawsuit against DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois alleging infringement by the ATTUNE ® Knee System. In April 2017, MedIdea filed an amended complaint adding DePuy Synthes Products, Inc. and DePuy Synthes Sales, Inc. as named defendants. MedIdea alleges infringement of United States Patent Nos. 6,558,426 (’426); 8,273,132 (’132); 8,721,730 (’730) and 9,492,280 (’280) relating to posterior stabilized knee systems. Specifically, MedIdea alleges that the SOFCAM TM Contact feature of the ATTUNE ® posterior stabilized knee products infringes the patents-in-suit. MedIdea is seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief. In June 2017, the case was transferred to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. A claim construction hearing was held in October 2018, and a claim construction order was issued in November 2018. In December 2018, MedIdea stipulated to non-infringement of the ’132, ’730 and ’280 patents, based on the district court’s claim construction and reserving its right to appeal that construction, leaving only the ’426 patent at issue before the district court. In January 2019, the district court stayed the case pending a decision in the Inter Partes Review proceeding on the ’426 patent (see below). In December 2017, DePuy Synthes Products, Inc. filed a Petition for Inter Partes Review with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), seeking to invalidate the two claims of the ’426 patent asserted in the district court litigation, and in June 2018, the USPTO instituted review of those claims. A hearing trial is scheduled for March 2019, and a decision in the proceeding is due by June 2019. In December 2016, Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc. and Ethicon Endo-Surgery, LLC (now known as Ethicon LLC) sued Covidien, Inc. in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts seeking a declaration that United States Patent Nos. 6,585,735 (the ’735 patent); 7,118,587; 7,473,253; 8,070,748 and 8,241,284 (the ’284 patent), are either invalid or not infringed by Ethicon’s ENSEAL ® X1 Large Jaw Tissue Sealer product. In April 2017, Covidien LP, Covidien Sales LLC, and Covidien AG (collectively, Covidien) answered and counterclaimed, denying the allegations, asserting willful infringement of the ’735 patent, the ’284 patent and United States Patent Nos. 8,323,310 (the ’310 patent); 9,084,608; 9,241,759 (the ’759 patent) and 9,113,882, and seeking damages and an injunction. Covidien filed a motion for preliminary injunction, which was denied in 87 October 2017. The parties have entered joint stipulations such that only the ’735 patent, the ’310 patent and the ’759 patent remain in dispute. Trial is scheduled to begin in September 2019. In November 2017, Board of Regents, The University of Texas System and Tissuegen, Inc. (collectively, UT) filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas against Ethicon, Inc. and Ethicon US, LLC alleging the manufacture and sale of VICRYL ® Plus Antibacterial Sutures, MONOCRYL ® Plus Antibacterial Sutures, PDS ® Plus Antibacterial Sutures, STRATAFIX ® POS ® Antibacterial Sutures and STRATAFIX ® MONOCRYL ® Plus Antibacterial Sutures infringe plaintiffs’ United States Patent Nos. 6,596,296 and 7,033,603 directed to implantable polymer drug releasing biodegradable fibers containing a therapeutic agent. UT is seeking damages and an injunction. In December 2018, Ethicon filed petitions with the USPTO, seeking Inter Partes Review (IPR) of both asserted patents. Those petitions have been stayed by the USPTO pending a decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in an unrelated case. Pharmaceutical In April 2016, MorphoSys AG, a German biotech company, filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Janssen Biotech, Inc. (JBI), Genmab U.S. Inc. and Genmab A/S (collectively, Genmab) in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. MorphoSys alleged that JBI’s manufacture and sale of DARZALEX ® (daratumumab) willfully infringed MorphoSys’ United States Patent Nos. 8,263,746, 9,200,061 and 9,785,590. MorphoSys sought money damages. JBI licenses patents and the commercial rights to DARZALEX ® from Genmab. In January 2019, the district court granted summary judgment in JBI and Genmab’s favor, invalidating the asserted claims of the patents-in-suit, and the parties filed a joint stipulation of dismissal of the action. In August 2016, Sandoz Ltd and Hexal AG (collectively, Sandoz) filed a lawsuit in the English High Court against G.D. Searle LLC, a Pfizer company (Searle) and Janssen Sciences Ireland UC (JSI) alleging that Searle’s supplementary protection certificate SPC/GB07/038 (SPC), which is exclusively licensed to JSI, is invalid and should be revoked. Janssen-Cilag Limited sells PREZISTA ® (darunavir) in the United Kingdom pursuant to this license. In October 2016, Searle and JSI counterclaimed against Sandoz for threatened infringement of the SPC based on statements of its plans to launch generic darunavir in the United Kingdom. Sandoz admitted that its generic darunavir product would infringe the SPC if it is found valid. Searle and JSI are seeking an order enjoining Sandoz from marketing its generic darunavir before the expiration of the SPC. Following a trial in April 2017, the court entered a decision holding that the SPC is valid and granting a final injunction. Sandoz has appealed the court’s decision and the injunction is stayed pending the appeal. In January 2018, the court referred the issue on appeal to the Court of Justice for the European Union (CJEU) and stayed the proceedings pending the CJEU’s ruling on the issue. In April 2018, Acerta Pharma B.V., AstraZeneca UK Ltd and AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware against Pharmacylics LLC and Abbvie Inc. (collectively, Abbvie), alleging that the manufacture and sale of IMBRUVICA ® infringes U.S. Patent No. 7,459,554. Janssen Biotech, Inc., which commercializes IMBRUVICA ® jointly with Abbvie, intervened in the action in November 2018. A trial is scheduled to begin in January 2021. REMICADE ® Related Cases In August 2014, Celltrion Healthcare Co. Ltd. and Celltrion Inc. (collectively, Celltrion) filed an application with the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for approval to make and sell its own infliximab biosimilar. In March 2015, Janssen Biotech, Inc. (JBI) filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts against Celltrion and Hospira Healthcare Corporation (Hospira), which has exclusive marketing rights for Celltrion’s infliximab biosimilar in the United States, seeking, among other things, a declaratory judgment that their biosimilar product infringes or potentially infringes several JBI patents, including United States Patent No. 6,284,471 relating to REMICADE ® (infliximab) (the ’471 patent) and United States Patent No. 7,598,083 (the ’083 patent) directed to the cell culture media used to make Celltrion’s biosimilar. In August 2016, the district court granted both Celltrion’s and Hospira’s motions for summary judgment of invalidity of the ’471 patent. JBI appealed those decisions to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In January 2018, the Federal Circuit dismissed the appeal as moot based on its affirmance of a decision by the USPTO’s Patent Trial and Appeal Board affirming invalidity of the ’471 patent. In June 2016, JBI filed two additional patent infringement lawsuits asserting the ’083 patent, one against Celltrion and Hospira in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts and the other against HyClone Laboratories, Inc., the manufacturer of the cell culture media that Celltrion uses to make its biosimilar product, in the United States District Court for the District of Utah. On July 30, 2018 the district court granted Celltrion’s motion for summary judgment of non-infringement and entered an order dismissing the ’083 lawsuit against Celltrion and Hospira. JBI appealed to the United States Court of 88 Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The litigation against HyClone in Utah is stayed pending the outcome of the Massachusetts actions. The FDA approved the first infliximab biosimilar for sale in the United States in 2016, and a number of such products have been launched. Litigation Against Filers of Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) The following summarizes lawsuits pending against generic companies that have filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) with the FDA or undertaken similar regulatory processes outside of the United States, seeking to market generic forms of products sold by various subsidiaries of Johnson & Johnson prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. These ANDAs typically include allegations of non-infringement and invalidity of the applicable patents. In the event the subsidiaries are not successful in an action, or the automatic statutory stay of the ANDAs expires before the United States District Court rulings are obtained, the third-party companies involved would have the ability, upon approval of the FDA, to introduce generic versions of their products to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for the applicable products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. In addition, from time to time, subsidiaries may settle these types of actions and such settlements can involve the introduction of generic versions of the products at issue to the market prior to the expiration of the relevant patents. The Inter Partes Review (IPR) process with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), created under the 2011 America Invents Act, is also being used at times by generic companies in conjunction with ANDAs and lawsuits, to challenge the applicable patents. ZYTIGA ® In July 2015, Janssen Biotech, Inc., Janssen Oncology, Inc. and Janssen Research & Development, LLC (collectively, Janssen) and BTG International Ltd. (BTG) initiated a patent infringement lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey against a number of generic companies (and certain of their affiliates and/or suppliers) who filed ANDAs seeking approval to market a generic version of ZYTIGA ® 250mg before the expiration of United States Patent No. 8,822,438 (the ’438 patent). The generic companies include Amneal Pharmaceuticals, LLC and Amneal Pharmaceuticals of New York, LLC (collectively, Amneal); Apotex Inc. and Apotex Corp. (collectively, Apotex); Citron Pharma LLC (Citron); Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Ltd. and Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Inc. (collectively, Dr. Reddy’s); Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Mylan Inc. (collectively, Mylan); Par Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Par Pharmaceutical Companies, Inc. (collectively, Par); Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. and Sun Pharmaceuticals Industries, Inc. (collectively, Sun); Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. (Teva); Wockhardt Bio A.G.; Wockhardt USA LLC and Wockhardt Ltd. (collectively, Wockhardt); West-Ward Pharmaceutical Corp. (West-Ward) and Hikma Pharmaceuticals, LLC (Hikma). Janssen and BTG also initiated patent infringement lawsuits in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey against Amerigen Pharmaceuticals Limited (Amerigen) in May 2016, and Glenmark Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Glenmark) in June 2016, each of whom filed an ANDA seeking approval to market its generic version of ZYTIGA ® before the expiration of the ’438 patent. These lawsuits have been consolidated with the lawsuit filed in July 2015. In August 2015, Janssen and BTG filed an additional jurisdictional protective lawsuit against the Mylan defendants in the United States District Court for the Northern District of West Virginia, which has been stayed. In August 2017, Janssen and BTG initiated a patent infringement lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey against Teva, who filed an ANDA seeking approval to market a generic version of ZYTIGA ® 500mg before the expiration of the ’438 patent. This lawsuit has been consolidated with the lawsuit filed in July 2015. In February 2018, Janssen and BTG filed a patent infringement lawsuit against MSN Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and MSN Laboratories Private Limited (collectively, MSN) in United States District Court for the District of New Jersey based on its ANDA seeking approval for a generic version of ZYTIGA ® prior to the expiration of the ’438 patent. In November 2018, Janssen and BTG initiated a patent infringement lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey against Qilu Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. and Qilu Pharma, Inc. (collectively, Qilu), who filed an ANDA seeking approval to market a generic version of ZYTIGA ® before the expiration of the ’438 patent. In December 2017, Janssen and BTG entered into a settlement agreement with Glenmark. In January 2018, Janssen dismissed its lawsuit against Sun after it withdrew its ANDA. In April 2018, Janssen and BTG entered into a settlement agreement with Apotex. 89 In October 2018, the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey issued a ruling invalidating all asserted claims of the ’438 patent. The court held that the patent claims would be infringed if the patent were valid. Janssen appealed the court’s decision. In November 2018, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit denied Janssen’s request for an injunction pending appeal. As a result, several generic versions of ZYTIGA ® have entered the market. Janssen has appealed the decision of the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, and the oral argument on the appeal is scheduled for March 2019. The lawsuits against MSN and Qilu remain pending in the district courts. In each of these lawsuits, Janssen is seeking an order enjoining the defendants from marketing their generic versions of ZYTIGA ® before the expiration of the ’438 patent. Several generic companies including Amerigen, Argentum Pharmaceuticals LLC (Argentum), Mylan, Wockhardt, Actavis, Amneal, Dr. Reddy’s, Sun, Teva, West-Ward and Hikma filed Petitions for Inter Partes Review (IPR) with the USPTO, seeking to invalidate the ’438 patent. In January 2018, the USPTO issued decisions finding the ’438 patent claims unpatentable, and Janssen requested rehearing. In December 2018, the USPTO denied Janssen’s request for rehearing of the IPR decisions. Janssen filed an appeal, which was consolidated with the above-mentioned appeal of the decision of the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. In October 2017, Janssen Inc. and Janssen Oncology, Inc. (collectively, Janssen) initiated two Notices of Application under Section 6 of the Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations against Teva Canada Limited (Teva) and the Minister of Health in Canada in response to Teva's filing Abbreviated New Drug Submissions (ANDS) and seeking approval to market generic versions of ZYTIGA ® 250mg and ZYTIGA ® 500mg before the expiration of Canadian Patent No. 2,661,422.

GOVERNMENT PROCEEDINGS Like other companies in the pharmaceutical and medical devices industries, Johnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation by national, state and local government agencies in the United States and other countries in which they operate. As a result, interaction with government agencies is ongoing. The most significant litigation brought by, and investigations conducted by, government agencies are listed below. It is possible that criminal charges and substantial fines and/or civil penalties or damages could result from government investigations or litigation. Average Wholesale Price (AWP) Litigation Johnson & Johnson and several of its pharmaceutical subsidiaries (the J&J AWP Defendants), along with numerous other pharmaceutical companies, were named as defendants in a series of lawsuits in state and federal courts involving allegations that the pricing and marketing of certain pharmaceutical products amounted to fraudulent and otherwise actionable conduct because, among other things, the companies allegedly reported an inflated Average Wholesale Price (AWP) for the drugs at issue. Payors alleged that they used those AWPs in calculating provider reimbursement levels. The plaintiffs in these cases included three classes of private persons or entities that paid for any portion of the purchase of the drugs at issue based on AWP, and state government entities that made Medicaid payments for the drugs at issue based on AWP. Many of these cases, both federal actions and state actions removed to federal court, were consolidated for pre-trial purposes in a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, where all claims against the J&J AWP Defendants were ultimately dismissed. The J&J AWP Defendants also prevailed in a case brought by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Other AWP cases have been resolved through court order or settlement. Two cases remain pending. In a case brought by Illinois, trial has been scheduled for March 2019. In New Jersey, a putative class action based upon AWP allegations is pending against Centocor, Inc. and Ortho Biotech Inc. (both now Janssen Biotech, Inc.), Johnson & Johnson and ALZA Corporation. Opioids Litigation Beginning in 2014 and continuing to the present, Johnson & Johnson and Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI), along with other pharmaceutical companies, have been named in more than 1,600 lawsuits brought by certain state and local governments related to the marketing of opioids, including DURAGESIC ® , NUCYNTA ® and NUCYNTA ® ER. To date, complaints against pharmaceutical companies, including Johnson & Johnson and JPI, have been filed in state court by the state Attorneys General in Arkansas, Florida, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma and South Dakota. Complaints against the manufacturers also have been filed in state or federal court by city, county and local government agencies in the following states: Alabama; Arkansas; California; Connecticut; Florida; Georgia; Illinois; Kentucky; Louisiana; Maine; Maryland; Massachusetts; Mississippi; Missouri; Nevada; New Hampshire; New Jersey; New Mexico; New York; North Carolina; Ohio; Oklahoma; Oregon; Pennsylvania; Rhode Island; South Carolina; South Dakota; Tennessee; Texas; Utah; Virginia; Washington; West Virginia and Wisconsin. The Government of Puerto Rico filed suit in Superior Court of San Juan. In addition, the Province of British Columbia filed suit in Canada. These actions allege a variety of claims related to opioids marketing practices, including false advertising, unfair competition, public nuisance, consumer fraud violations, deceptive acts and practices, false claims and unjust enrichment. The suits generally seek penalties and/or injunctive and monetary relief and, in some of the suits, the plaintiffs are seeking joint and several liability among the defendants. These cases are in early stages of litigation. In October 2017, Johnson & Johnson and JPI were both served with a motion to consolidate 66 pending matters into a federal Multi District Litigation in the Southern District of Ohio.

Johnson & Johnson, JPI and other pharmaceutical companies have also received subpoenas or requests for information related to opioids marketing practices from the following state Attorneys General: Alaska, Indiana, Montana, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Washington. In September 2017, Johnson & Johnson and JPI were contacted by the Texas and Colorado Attorney General’s Offices on behalf of approximately 38 states regarding a multi-state Attorney General investigation.

Other 93 In August 2012, DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc., DePuy, Inc. (now known as DePuy Synthes, Inc.), and Johnson & Johnson Services, Inc. (collectively DePuy) received an informal request from the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts and the Civil Division of the United States Department of Justice (the United States) for the production of materials relating to the DePuy ASR™ XL Hip device. In July 2014, the United States notified the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts that it had declined to intervene in a qui tam case filed pursuant to the False Claims Act against the companies. In February 2016, the district court granted the companies’ motion to dismiss with prejudice, unsealed the qui tam complaint, and denied the qui tam relators’ request for leave to file a further amended complaint. The qui tam relators appealed the case to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. In July 2017, the First Circuit affirmed the district court’s dismissal in part, reversed in part, and affirmed the decision to deny the relators’ request to file a third amended complaint. The relators’ remaining claims are now pending before the district court, and fact discovery is currently scheduled to close in September 2019. Additionally, DePuy filed a petition for certiorari with the United States Supreme Court, seeking review of the First Circuit’s decision. The Supreme Court denied the petition in April 2018. Since October 2013, a group of State Attorneys General have issued Civil Investigative Demands relating to the development, sales and marketing of several of DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc.'s hip products. In July 2014, the Oregon Department of Justice, which was investigating these matters independently of the other states, announced a settlement of its ASR™ XL Hip device investigation with the State of Oregon. In December 2018, the Company, the remaining states and the District of Columbia agreed to settle all of the investigations, and on January 22, 2019, the states and the Company filed consent judgments resolving the matter. In October 2012, Johnson & Johnson was contacted by the California Attorney General's office regarding a multi-state Attorney General investigation of the marketing of surgical mesh products for hernia and urogynecological purposes by Johnson & Johnson's subsidiary, Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon). Johnson & Johnson and Ethicon have since entered into a series of tolling agreements with the 47 states and the District of Columbia participating in the multi-state investigation and have responded to Civil Investigative Demands served by certain of the participating states. The states are seeking monetary and injunctive relief. In May 2016, California and Washington filed civil complaints against Johnson & Johnson, Ethicon and Ethicon US, LLC alleging violations of their consumer protection statutes. Similar complaints were filed against the companies by Kentucky in August 2016 and by Mississippi in October 2017. Johnson & Johnson and Ethicon have entered into a new tolling agreement with the remaining 43 states and the District of Columbia. In December 2012, Therakos, Inc. (Therakos), formerly a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson and part of the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Inc.

The United States Attorney's Office requested that OCD and Johnson & Johnson preserve documents that could relate to the investigation. Therakos was subsequently acquired by an affiliate of Gores Capital Partners III, L.P. in January 2013, and OCD was divested in June 2014. Following the divestiture of OCD, Johnson & Johnson retains OCD’s portion of any liability that may result from the investigation for activity that occurred prior to the sale of Therakos. In March 2014 and March 2016, the United States Attorney’s Office requested that Johnson & Johnson produce certain documents, and Johnson & Johnson is cooperating with those requests. In June 2014, the Mississippi Attorney General filed a complaint in Chancery Court of The First Judicial District of Hinds County, Mississippi against Johnson & Johnson and Johnson & Johnson Consumer Companies, Inc. (now known as Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc.) (JJCI). The complaint alleges that defendants failed to disclose alleged health risks associated with female consumers' use of talc contained in JOHNSON'S ® Baby Powder and JOHNSON'S ® Shower to Shower (a product divested in 2012) and seeks injunctive and monetary relief. Trial is stayed pending interlocutory appeal of a denial of JJCI's motion for summary judgment. In March 2016, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI) received a Civil Investigative Demand from the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York related to JPI’s contractual relationships with pharmacy benefit managers over the period from January 1, 2006 to the present with regard to certain of JPI's pharmaceutical products.

The United States 94 District Court for the Central District of California dismissed the claim in April 2018. In May 2018, the relator filed a notice of appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. In November 2018, a second whistleblower lawsuit was unsealed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. The lawsuit is substantially similar to the lawsuit under appeal but is brought in the name of the original relator. The federal and state governments have declined to intervene in the second suit at this time. In February 2017, Johnson & Johnson received a subpoena from the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts seeking the production of records pertaining to payments to any 501(c)(3) charitable organization that provides financial assistance to Medicare patients. Multiple pharmaceutical companies have publicly reported receipt of subpoenas and ongoing inquiries similar to this one and the one described below. The government has represented that it will not be pursuing action against the company in this matter. Actelion Pharmaceuticals US, Inc. (Actelion US), received a subpoena in May 2016, with follow-up requests for documents from the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts. The subpoena seeks the production of records pertaining to Actelion US’ payments to 501(c)(3) charitable organizations that provide financial assistance to Medicare patients.

In July 2018 the Public Prosecution Service in Rio de Janeiro and representatives from the Brazilian antitrust authority CADE inspected the offices of more than 30 companies including Johnson & Johnson do Brasil Indústria e Comércio de Produtos para Saúde Ltda. The authorities appear to be investigating allegations of possible anti-competitive behavior and possible improper payments in the medical device industry. The United States Department of Justice and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission have made additional preliminary inquiries about the inspection in Brazil, and Johnson & Johnson do Brasil Indústria e Comércio de Produtos para Saúde Ltda. is cooperating with those requests. From time to time, the Company has received requests from a variety of United States Congressional Committees to produce information relevant to ongoing congressional inquiries. It is the policy of Johnson & Johnson to cooperate with these inquiries by producing the requested information. GENERAL LITIGATION In April 2016, a putative class action was filed against Johnson & Johnson, Johnson & Johnson Sales and Logistics Company, LLC and McNeil PPC, Inc. (now known as Johnson & Johnson Consumer, Inc.) in New Jersey Superior Court, Camden County on behalf of persons who reside in the state of New Jersey who purchased various McNeil over-the-counter products from December 2008 through the present. The complaint alleges violations of the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act. Following the grant of a motion to dismiss and the filing of an amended complaint, in May 2017, the court denied a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. In December 2018, a settlement was reached and the matter has been dismissed. 95 In May 2014, two purported class actions were filed in federal court, one in the United States District Court for the Central District of California and one in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Illinois, against Johnson & Johnson and Johnson & Johnson Consumer Companies, Inc.

Restructuring In the first quarter of 2016, the Company announced restructuring actions in its Medical Devices segment to better serve the needs of patients and customers in today’s evolving healthcare marketplace. The Company has undertaken actions to strengthen its go-to-market model, accelerate the pace of innovation, further prioritize key platforms and geographies, and streamline operations while maintaining high quality standards. In 2018, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $462 million , of which $46 million was included in cost of products sold and $227 million was included in other (income) expense. Total project costs of $2.5 billion have been recorded since the restructuring has been announced. This restructuring program was completed in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2018. On April 17, 2018, the Company announced plans to implement a series of actions across its Global Supply Chain that are intended to focus resources and increase investments in the critical capabilities, technologies and solutions necessary to manufacture and supply its product portfolio, enhance agility and drive growth. The Global Supply Chain actions will include expanding the use of strategic collaborations and bolstering initiatives to reduce complexity, improve cost-competitiveness, enhance capabilities and optimize the Supply Chain network. For additional details on the global supply chain restructuring strategic collaborations see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2018, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $238 million , of which $59 million was included in cost of products sold and $117 million was included in other (income) expense. See the following table for additional details on the restructuring programs. In total, the Company expects the Global Supply Chain actions to generate approximately $0.6 billion to $0.8 billion in annual pre-tax cost savings that will be substantially delivered by 2022. The Company expects to record pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $1.9 billion to $2.3 billion , over the 4 to 5 year period of this activity. These costs are associated with network optimizations, exit costs and accelerated depreciation and amortization. 97 The following table summarizes the severance charges and the associated spending under these initiatives through the fiscal year ended 2018: (Dollars in Millions) Severance Asset Write-offs Other** Total Reserve balance, January 3, 2016 $ 484 — 17 501 2016 activity (104 ) — (16 ) (120 ) Reserve balance, January 1, 2017 380 — 1 381 2017 activity (151 ) — 37 (114 ) Reserve balance, December 31, 2017 229 — 38 267 Current year activity: Charges — 132 568 700 Cash payments (35 ) — (558 ) (593 ) Settled non cash — (132 ) — (132 ) Reserve balance, December 30, 2018* $ 194 — 48 242 *Cash outlays for severance are expected to be substantially paid out over the next 2 years in accordance with the Company's plans and local laws. **Other includes project expense such as salaries for employees supporting the initiative and consulting expenses. Although the Medical Devices restructuring program was completed in 2018, the Company expects that severance charges will continue beyond that date. The Company continuously reevaluates its severance reserves related to restructuring and the timing of payments has extended due to the planned release of associates regarding several longer-term projects. The Company believes that the existing severance reserves are sufficient to cover the Global Supply Chain plans given the period over which the actions will take place. The Company will continue to assess and make adjustments as necessary if additional amounts become probable and estimable. Approximately 2,375 individuals received separation payments since these restructuring announcements. 98 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Johnson & Johnson Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, of comprehensive income, of equity, and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 30, 2018 including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 , and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 30, 2018 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. Basis for Opinions The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 99 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Florham Park, New Jersey February 20, 2019 We have served as the Company’s auditor since at least 1920. We have not been able to determine the specific year we began serving as auditor of the Company. 100 Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, management is required to assess the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year and report, based on that assessment, whether the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective. Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the reliability of the Company’s financial reporting and the preparation of external financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal controls over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, internal control over financial reporting determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. The Company’s management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2018. In making this assessment, the Company used the criteria established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in “Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013).” These criteria are in the areas of control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communication, and monitoring. The Company’s assessment included extensive documenting, evaluating and testing the design and operating effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting. Based on the Company’s processes and assessment, as described above, management has concluded that, as of December 30, 2018, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective. The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2018 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which appears herein. /s/ Alex Gorsky /s/ Joseph J.

Form 10-K Summary 36 ii CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING F ORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements contained in this Form 10-K that do not relate to matters of historical fact should be considered forward-looking statements, including but not limited to statements regarding our expected market share, business strategy, dealer network, anticipated financial results, and liquidity. We use words such as “could,” “may,” “might,” “will,” “expect,” “likely,” “believe,” “continue,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” “project,” and other similar expressions to identify some forward-looking statements, but not all forward-looking statements include these words. All of our forward-looking statements involve estimates and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. Accordingly, any such statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the information described under the caption “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Form 10-K. The forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K are based on assumptions that we have made in light of our industry experience and our perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments, and other factors we believe are appropriate under the circumstances. You should understand that these statements are not guarantees of performance or results. They involve risks, uncertainties (many of which are beyond our control), and assumptions. Although we believe that these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, you should be aware that many important factors could affect our actual operating and financial performance and cause our performance to differ materially from the performance anticipated in the forward-looking statements. We believe these important factors include, but are not limited to, those described under “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this Form 10-K and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any of these assumptions prove incorrect, our actual operating and financial performance may vary in material respects from the performance projected in these forward-looking statements. In addition, new important factors that could cause our business not to develop as we expect may emerge from time to time. Further, any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement contained in this Form 10-K to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which it is made or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances. The forward-looking statements contained herein should not be relied upon as representing our views as of any date subsequent to the filing date of this Form 10-K. BASIS OF PRE SENTATION Our fiscal year begins on July 1 and ends on June 30 with the interim quarterly reporting periods consisting of thirteen weeks. Therefore, the quarter end will not always coincide with the date of the end of the calendar month. We refer to our fiscal years based on the calendar-year in which they end. Accordingly, references to fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 represent our financial results for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023, June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2021, respectively. For ease of reference, we identify our fiscal years in this Form 10-K by reference to the period from July 1 to June 30 of the year in which the fiscal year ends. For example, “fiscal 2023” refers to our fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. MasterCraft Boat Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”), a Delaware corporation, operates primarily through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, MasterCraft Boat Company, LLC, MasterCraft Services, LLC, MasterCraft Parts, Ltd., MasterCraft International Sales Administration, Inc., Aviara Boats, LLC, Crest Marine, LLC, and NSB Boats, LLC. Unless the context otherwise requires, the Company and its subsidiaries collectively are referred to as the “Company,” “we,” or “us” in this Form 10-K. 1 PART I ITEM 1. B USINESS We are a leading innovator, designer, manufacturer, and marketer of recreational powerboats sold through our three brands, MasterCraft, Crest, and Aviara. Through these three brands, over the last five years, we have had leading market share positions in two of the fastest growing categories of the powerboat industry, ski/wake boats and pontoon boats, while also growing market share within the luxury day boat segment. As a leader in recreational marine, we strive to deliver the best on-water experience through innovative, high-quality products with a relentless focus on the consumer. On September 2, 2022, the Company completed the sale of its NauticStar business. This business, which was previously reported as the Company's NauticStar segment until fiscal 2023, is being reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Consolidated financial information presented for all periods is related to the continuing operations. See Note 3 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on Discontinued Operations. Our Segments MasterCraft Segment Our MasterCraft segment consists of our MasterCraft brand, which manufactures premium ski/wake boats. The MasterCraft brand was founded in 1968 and evolved over the next 55 years to become the most award-winning ski/wake boat manufacturer in the world. Today, MasterCraft participates in the fastest growing category within the powerboat industry by producing the industry’s premier competitive water ski, wakeboarding, and wake surfing performance boats. We believe the MasterCraft brand is known among boating enthusiasts for high performance, premier quality, and relentless innovation. We believe that the market recognizes MasterCraft as a premier brand in the powerboat industry due to the overall superior value proposition that our boats deliver to consumers. We work tirelessly every day to maintain this iconic brand reputation. Crest Segment Our Crest segment consists of our Crest brand, which manufactures pontoon boats. Crest participates in the second-fastest growing category in the powerboat industry. Crest, which we acquired in October 2018, was founded in 1957 and has grown to be one of the top producers of innovative, high-quality pontoon boats ranging from 20 to 27 feet. Crest’s long-standing reputation for high-quality, standard features and content, and innovation provides Crest with strong dealer and consumer bases in its core geographic markets. Aviara Segment Our Aviara segment consists of our Aviara brand, which manufactures luxury day boats. Aviara is a de novo brand, developed in-house, and focused on serving the luxury recreational day boat category of the powerboat industry. From its introduction in February 2019 through June 2023, Aviara expanded to three models between 32 feet and 40 feet in length, and in fiscal 2024, will expand to include a 28 foot model, all of which feature both outboard and sterndrive propulsion. Aviara boats feature distinct European styling and offer an elevated open water experience by fusing progressive style and effortless comfort in its modern luxury vessels. Unless the context otherwise requires, “MasterCraft,” “Crest,” and “Aviara,” as used herein, refers to our segments as described above. Our Products We design, manufacture, and sell premium recreational inboard ski/wake, outboard, and sterndrive boats that we believe deliver superior performance for water skiing, wakeboarding, and wake surfing, as well as general recreational boating. In addition, we offer various accessories, including trailers and aftermarket parts. Our MasterCraft portfolio of ProStar, XStar, X, XT, and NXT models are designed for the highest levels of performance, styling, and enjoyment for both recreational and competitive use.

The Electric Line harmonizes industry innovations by introducing eco-friendly pontoon boats. The new Current model allows consumers to enjoy a new level of peace and relaxation with less noise and minimal emissions. Crest’s retail prices range from approximately $35,000 to $220,000. Our Aviara portfolio of luxury recreational day boats was designed in-house with the vision to create pleasure crafts that defy compromise. The Aviara brand drew on MasterCraft’s legacy of quality. Aviara’s boat designs were inspired by four product design principles – Progressive Style, Elevated Control, Modern Comfort and Quality Details. Aviara’s models consist of the AV32, a 32-foot luxury bowrider, the AV36, a 36-foot luxury bowrider, the AV40, the brand’s flagship 40-foot luxury bowrider, and beginning in fiscal 2024, AV28, a 28-foot luxury bowrider, for the ultimate on-the-water experience. All models are available in either outboard or sterndrive propulsion, and Aviara’s retail prices range from approximately $200,000 to over $1,300,000. We believe there will be significant model expansion opportunities for Aviara in the future. Our Dealer Network Our products are sold through extensive networks of independent dealers in North America and internationally. We target our distribution to the market category’s highest performing dealers. The majority of our MasterCraft brand dealers are exclusive to our MasterCraft product lines within the ski/wake category, highlighting the commitment of our key dealers to the MasterCraft brand. Our other brands are generally served on a nonexclusive basis by their respective dealers. We consistently review our distribution networks to identify opportunities to expand our geographic footprint and improve our coverage of the market. We constantly monitor the health and strength of our dealers by analyzing each dealer’s retail sales and inventory and have established processes to identify under-performing dealers in order to assist them in improving their performance, to allow us to switch to a more effective dealer, or to direct product to markets with the greatest retail demand. These processes also allow us to better monitor dealer inventory levels and product turns and contribute to a healthier dealer network that is better able to stock and sell our products. We believe our outstanding dealer networks and our proactive approach to dealer management allow us to distribute our products more efficiently than our competitors and will help us capitalize on growth opportunities as our industry volumes continue to increase. For fiscal 2023, the Company’s top ten dealers accounted for approximately 40% of our net sales and one of our dealers individually accounted for 14.9%, or approximately $98.6 million. North America. As of June 30, 2023, our MasterCraft brand had a total of 108 dealers across 158 locations. Our Crest brand had a total of 148 dealers across 185 locations. Our Aviara brand is sold through a distribution network consisting of one dealer with 57 locations. Outside of North America. As of June 30, 2023, through our MasterCraft brand, we had a total of 43 international dealers and 43 locations. Our Crest brand had two international dealers in two locations. Aviara had no international dealers. We define international dealers as those dealers with locations outside of North America. We are present in Europe, Australia, South America, Africa, Asia, including Hong Kong, and the Middle East. We generated 4.6%, 5.5%, and 5.1% of our net sales outside of North America in fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Dealer Relations We have developed a system of financial incentives for our dealers based on achievement of key benchmarks. In addition, we provide our dealers with comprehensive sales training and a complete set of technology-based tools designed to help dealers maximize performance. Our dealer incentive program has been refined through years of experience with some of the key elements including wholesale rebates, retail rebates and promotions, other allowances, and floor plan interest reimbursement or cash discounts to encourage balanced production throughout the year. Beyond our incentive programs, we have developed a proprietary web-based management tool that is used by our dealers on a day-to-day basis to improve their own businesses as well as enhance communication with our factory and sales management teams. Our business-to-business application efficiently executes many critical functions, including warranty registrations, warranty claims, boat ordering and tracking, parts ordering, technical support, and inventory reporting. This system facilitates communication between our sales team and the dealer network and allows our manufacturing department to review consumer demand in real time. 3 Manufacturing MasterCraft boats and trailers are manufactured and lake-tested at our 310,000 square-foot facility located in Vonore, Tennessee. We believe MasterCraft has the only boat manufacturing facility to achieve compliance with all three of the ISO 9001 (Quality Management Systems), 14001 (Environmental Management Systems), and 18001 (International Occupational Health and Safety Management System) standards. Crest boats are manufactured at our 270,000 square-foot facility located in Owosso, Michigan. Aviara boats are manufactured at our 130,000 square-foot facility in Merritt Island, Florida. The rigorous and consumer-centric attention to detail in the design and manufacturing of our products results in boats of high quality which provides an exceptional on water experience across all of our brands. Our dedication to quality permits our consumers to enjoy our products with confidence. Our boats are built through a continuous flow manufacturing process that encompasses fabrication, assembly, quality management, and testing. We manufacture certain components and subassemblies for our boats, such as upholstery, and procure other components from third-party vendors and install them on the boat. We have several exclusive supplier partnerships for certain critical components, such as aluminum billet, towers, and engine packages. For MasterCraft, we also build custom trailers that match the exact size and design-characteristics of our boats. Suppliers We purchase a wide variety of raw materials from our supplier base, including resins, fiberglass, aluminum, lumber and steel, as well as parts and components such as engines and electronic controls. We maintain long-term contracts with certain strategic suppliers and informal arrangements with other suppliers. We are focused on working with our supply chain partners to enable cost improvement, world-class quality, and continuous product innovation. We have engaged our key suppliers in collaborative preferred supplier relationships and have developed processes including annual cost reduction targets, regular reliability projects, and extensive product testing requirements to ensure that our suppliers produce to the highest levels of quality expected of our brands and at lowest total cost. These collaborative efforts begin at the design stage, as our key suppliers are integrated into design and development planning well in advance of launch, which allows us to control costs and to leverage the expertise of our suppliers in developing product innovations. We believe these collaborative relationships with our key strategic suppliers have contributed to significant improvements in product quality, innovation, and profitability. The most significant components used in manufacturing our boats, based on cost, are engine packages. For our MasterCraft brand, Ilmor Engineering, Inc. (“Ilmor”) is our exclusive engine supplier and for our Crest brand, Mercury Marine (“Mercury”) is our largest engine supplier. For our Aviara brand, Mercury provides outboard engines and Ilmor provides sterndrive engines. We maintain strong and long-standing relationships with Ilmor and Mercury. During fiscal 2023, Ilmor was our largest overall supplier. In addition to ski/wake and sterndrive engines, Ilmor’s affiliates produce engines used in a number of leading racing boats and race cars. We work closely with Ilmor to remain at the forefront of engine design, performance, and manufacturing. We believe our long-term relationships with our engine supplier partners is a key competitive advantage. Research and Development, Product Development and Engineering We are strategically and financially committed to innovation, as reflected in our dedicated product development and engineering groups and evidenced by our track record of new product and feature introduction. As of June 30, 2023, our product development and engineering group includes 67 professionals. These individuals bring to our product development efforts significant expertise across core disciplines, including boat design, computer-aided design, naval engineering, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering. They are responsible for execution of all facets of our new product and innovation strategy, starting with design and development of new boat models and innovative features, engineering these designs for manufacturing, and integrating new boats and features into production. Our product development and engineering functions work closely with our Strategic Portfolio Management Team which includes senior leadership from Sales, Marketing and Finance, all working together to develop our long-term product and innovation strategies. We have structured processes to obtain consumer, dealer, and management feedback to guide our long-term product lifecycle and portfolio planning. In addition, extensive testing and coordination with our manufacturing groups are important elements of our product development process, which we believe enable us to leverage the lessons from past launches and minimize the risk associated with the release of new products. Our strategy is to launch several new models each year, which will allow us to renew our product portfolio with innovative offerings at a rate that we believe will be difficult for our competitors to match without significant additional capital investments. In addition to our product strategy, we manage a separate innovation development process which allows us to design innovative new features for our boats in a disciplined manner and to launch these innovations in a more rapid time frame and with higher quality. These enhanced processes have reduced the time to market for our new product pipeline. Our research and product development expense for fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021 was $8.3 million, $7.2 million, and $5.8 million, respectively. 4 Intellectual Property We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, and copyright protection, trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, and contractual provisions to protect our rights in our brands, products, and proprietary technology. We also protect our vessel hull designs through vessel hull design registrations. This is an important part of our business and we intend to continue protecting our intellectual property. We currently hold more than 50 U.S. patents and more than 10 foreign patents, including utility and design patents for our transom surf seating, our DockStar handling system, and our SurfStar surf system technology among numerous other innovations. Provided that we comply with all statutory maintenance requirements, our patents are expected to expire between 2028 and 2041. We also have additional patent applications pending in the U.S. and worldwide. We also own in excess of 130 trademark registrations in various countries around the world, most notably for the MasterCraft, Crest, and Aviara names and/or logos, as well as numerous model names in MasterCraft’s Star Series, X, XT, and NXT product families, and we have several pending applications for additional registrations. Such trademarks may endure in perpetuity on a country-by-country basis provided that we comply with all statutory maintenance requirements, including continued use of each trademark in each such country. In addition, we own 38 registered U.S. copyrights. Finally, we have registered more than 50 vessel hull designs with the U.S. Copyright Office, the most recent of which will remain in force through 2030. Competitive Conditions and Position We believe each of our brands are highly competitive and have a reputation for quality. We compete by operating, developing, and acquiring a diversified portfolio of leading brands focused on the fastest growing segments of the powerboat industry; focusing relentlessly on delivering the best overall ownership experience to consumers; developing and continuously improving highly efficient production techniques and methods which result in highly innovative products; distributing our products through extensive, consumer-centric independent dealer networks; and attracting, developing, and retaining high-performing employees. Significant competition exists for each of our brands, and the markets in which we compete range from being relatively concentrated for the ski/wake category, to being fragmented for the pontoon category. As of December 2022, based on Statistical Surveys, Inc. (“SSI”) data, the top five brands accounted for approximately 71% of the ski/wake markets and approximately 50% for the pontoon market. Market participants also range from small, single-product businesses to large, diversified companies. In addition, we compete indirectly with businesses that offer alternative leisure products and activities. In recent history, the MasterCraft brand has consistently competed for the leading market share position in the U.S. among manufacturers of ski/wake boats based on unit volume. As of December 2022, based on SSI data, the MasterCraft brand has the #1 market share in the ski/wake category with 20.8%. As of December 2022, based on SSI data, the Crest brand has the #9 market share in the aluminum pontoon category with 4.1%. As of December 2022, based on SSI data, the Aviara brand has the #7 market share in the 30-foot to 43-foot bowrider category with 6.3%. Human Capital Resources We have approximately 1,060 employees as of June 30, 2023, of whom 560 primarily work at our MasterCraft facility in Tennessee, 260 primarily work at our Crest facility in Michigan, and 240 primarily work at our Aviara facility in Florida. None of our employees are unionized or subject to collective bargaining agreements. One of our strategic priorities is developing a high-performing work organization and work environment that is consumer-focused and attracts and retains superior employees. We strive to offer our employees career-specific tools, training, resources, and support development opportunities. We utilize a talent management process, which includes performance appraisal and development planning. We are also deeply invested in attracting and developing the next generation of workforce talent to the boating industry. We’ve partnered with local community and technical colleges by developing training programs and donating boats and supplies to position graduates for jobs in the boating industry upon graduation. Employee safety is always a top priority. We are focused on improving and innovating when it comes to the well-being of our dedicated workforce across our portfolio of brands. We take great care to ensure everyone at the Company is empowered to do their best work, in a safe and well-managed environment. We maintain clean, safe and healthy workplaces through our vigorous training programs and professional safety standards systems, including job hazard assessments and industrial hygiene and ventilation practices. Our compensation program is designed to facilitate high performance and generate results that will create value for our stockholders. We structure executive compensation to pay for performance, reward our executives with equity in the Company in order to align their interests with the interests of our stockholders and allow those employees to share in our stockholders’ success, which we believe creates a performance culture, maintains morale and attracts, motivates and retains top talent. Environmental, Safety, and Regulatory Matters Our operations are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations, including those concerning product safety, environmental protection, and occupational health and safety. We believe that our operations and products 5 are in compliance with these regulatory requirements. Historically, the cost of achieving and maintaining compliance with applicable laws and regulations has not been material. However, we cannot provide assurance that future costs and expenses required for us to comply with such laws and regulations, including any new or modified regulatory requirements, or to address newly discovered environmental conditions, will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, or cash flows. We have not been notified of and are otherwise currently not aware of any contamination at our current or former facilities for which we could be liable under environmental laws or regulations and we currently are not undertaking any remediation or investigation activities in connection with any contamination. However, future spills or accidents or the discovery of currently unknown conditions or non-compliances may give rise to investigation and remediation obligations or related liabilities and damage claims, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, or cash flows.

RISK FACTORS RISK FACTORS Our operations and financial results are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including those described below, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common stock. Risks Relating to Economic and Market Conditions Global economic conditions, particularly in the U.S., significantly affect our industry and business, and economic decline can materially impact our financial results. In times of economic uncertainty or recession, consumers tend to have less discretionary income and to defer significant spending on non-essential items, which may adversely affect our financial performance. The economic uncertainty caused by (i) general economic conditions, (ii) the impact of inflation and rising interest rates, (iii) labor shortages, (iv) supply chain disruptions, (v) regional or global conflicts, (vi) public health crises, pandemics, or national emergencies and (vii) actions and stimulus measures adopted by local, state and federal governments may lead to unfavorable business outcomes. We continue to develop our portfolio of brands, but our business remains cyclical and sensitive to consumer spending on new boats. Deterioration in general economic conditions that in turn diminishes consumer confidence or discretionary income may reduce our sales, or we may decide to lower pricing for our products, which could adversely affect our financial results, including increasing the potential for future impairment charges. Further, our products are recreational, and consumers’ limited discretionary income in times of economic hardship may be diverted to other activities that occupy their time, such as other forms of recreational, religious, cultural, or community activities. In addition, economic uncertainty may also increase certain costs of operation, such as financing costs, energy costs and insurance premiums, which in turn may impact our results of operations. We cannot predict the strength of global economies or the timing of economic recovery, either globally or in the specific markets in which we compete. Inflation and rising interest rates could adversely affect our financial results. The market prices of certain materials and components used in manufacturing our products, especially resins that are made with hydrocarbon feedstocks, fiberglass, aluminum, lumber, and steel, can be volatile. While, historically, inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations, significant increases in inflation, particularly those related to wages and increases in the cost of raw materials, recently have, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, new boat buyers often finance their purchases. Inflation, along with rising interest rates, could translate into an increased cost of boat ownership. Should inflation and increased interest rates continue to occur, prospective consumers may choose to forego or delay their purchases or buy a less expensive boat in the event credit is not available to finance their boat purchases. In addition, as discussed in more detail below, rising interest rates could also incentivize dealers to reduce their inventory levels in order to reduce their interest exposure. Rising interest rates may also increase the borrowing costs on new debt, which could affect the fair value of our investments. Fiscal concerns and policy changes may negatively impact worldwide economic and credit conditions and adversely affect our industry, business, and financial condition. Fiscal policy could have a material adverse impact on worldwide economic conditions, the financial markets, and availability of credit and, consequently, may negatively affect our industry, business, and overall financial condition. Consumers often finance purchases of our products, and as interest rates rise, the cost of financing the purchase also increases. While credit availability is adequate to support demand, interest rates began to rise significantly in the second half of fiscal 2022, and continued to rise throughout fiscal 2023. If credit conditions worsen and adversely affect the ability of consumers to finance potential purchases at acceptable terms and interest rates, it could result in a decrease in sales or delay improvement in sales. Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly. Borrowings under our revolving credit facility and term loans are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. Reference rates used to determine the applicable interest rates for our debt began to rise significantly in the second half of fiscal 2022, and continued to rise throughout fiscal 2023. If interest rates continue to increase, the debt service obligations on our indebtedness will continue to increase even if the amount borrowed remains the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our 7 indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease. Please see Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” for discussion of our market risk related to interest rates. An increase in energy costs may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our results of operations can be directly affected, positively and negatively, by volatility in the cost and availability of energy, which is subject to global supply and demand and other factors beyond our control. Prices for crude oil, natural gas and other energy supplies have been increasing and have been subject to high volatility, including as a result of geopolitical factors or otherwise. Further, the global clean energy movement may also reduce the availability of fossil fuels, which may in turn cause increases to energy costs. Higher energy costs result in increases in operating expenses at our manufacturing facilities, in the expense of shipping raw materials to our facilities, and in the expense of shipping products to our dealers. In addition, increases in energy costs may adversely affect the pricing and availability of petroleum-based raw materials, such as resins and foams that are used in our products. Higher fuel prices may also have an adverse effect on demand for our boats, as they increase cost of boat ownership and possibly affect product use. Higher fuel prices may also have an effect on consumer preferences causing a shift from traditional fuel-powered boats to electric boats. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our results. We sell products manufactured in the U.S. into certain international markets in U.S. dollars. The changing relationship of the U.S. dollar to foreign currencies has, from time to time, had a negative impact on our results of operations. Fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to these foreign currencies can adversely affect the price of our products in foreign markets and the costs we incur to import certain components for our products. We will often attempt to offset these higher prices with increased discounts, which can lead to reduced net sales per unit. Risks Relating to Our Business Our ability to adjust for demand in a rapidly changing environment may adversely affect our results of operations. The seasonality of retail demand for our products, together with our goal of balancing production throughout the year, requires us to manage our manufacturing and allocate our products to our dealer network to address anticipated retail demand and manage demand fluctuations caused by macroeconomic conditions and other factors. In addition, our dealers must manage seasonal changes in consumer demand and inventory. Our business may experience difficulty in adapting to rapidly changing production and sales volumes. We may not be able to recruit or maintain sufficient skilled labor or our suppliers may not be able to deliver sufficient quantities of parts and components for us to match production with rapid changes in forecasted demand. In addition, consumers may pursue other recreational activities if dealer pipeline inventories fall too low and it is not convenient to purchase our products, consumers may purchase from competitors, or our fixed costs may grow in response to increased demand. A failure to adjust dealer pipeline inventory levels to meet demand could adversely impact our results of operations. In addition, if our dealers reduce their inventories in response to weakness in retail demand, we could be required to reduce our production, resulting in lower rates of absorption of fixed costs in our manufacturing and, therefore, lower margins. As a result, we must balance the economies of level production with seasonal retail sales patterns experienced by our dealers and other macroeconomic conditions. Failure to adjust manufacturing levels adequately may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We have a fixed cost base that will affect our profitability if our sales decrease. The fixed cost levels of operating a powerboat manufacturer can put pressure on profit margins when sales and production decline. Our profitability depends, in part, on our ability to spread fixed costs over a sufficiently large number of products sold and shipped, and if we make a decision to reduce our rate of production, gross or net margins could be negatively affected. Consequently, decreased demand or the need to reduce production can lower our ability to absorb fixed costs and materially impact our financial condition or results of operations. We may not be able to execute our manufacturing strategy successfully, which could cause the profitability of our products to suffer. Our manufacturing strategy is designed to improve product quality and increase productivity, while reducing costs and increasing flexibility to respond to ongoing changes in the marketplace. To implement this strategy, we must be successful in our continuous improvement efforts, which depend on the involvement of management, production employees, and suppliers. Any inability to achieve these objectives could adversely impact the profitability of our products and our ability to deliver desirable products to our consumers. In addition, we have made strategic capital investments in capacity expansion activities to successfully capture growth opportunities and enhance product offerings, including brand relocation and plant expansions. Moving production to a different plant and expanding capacity at an existing facility involves risks, including difficulties initiating production within the cost and timeframe estimated, supplying product to customers when expected, integrating new products, and attracting sufficient skilled labor to handle additional production demands. If we fail to meet these objectives, it could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand for products and 8 increase the cost of production versus projections, both of which could result in a significant adverse impact on operating and financial results. Additionally, plant expansion can result in manufacturing inefficiencies, additional expenses, including higher wages or severance costs, and cost inefficiencies, which could negatively impact financial results. Adverse weather conditions and climate change events can have a negative effect on revenues. Changes in seasonal weather conditions can have a significant effect on our operating and financial results. Sales of our boats are typically stronger just before and during spring and summer, and favorable weather during these months generally has had a positive effect on consumer demand. Conversely, unseasonably cool weather, excessive rainfall, or drought conditions during these periods can reduce or change the timing of demand. Climate change could have an impact on longer-term natural weather trends, resulting in environmental changes including, but not limited to, increases in severe weather, changing sea levels, changes in sea, land and air temperatures, poor water conditions, or reduced access to water, could disrupt or negatively affect our business. Catastrophic events, including natural and environmental disasters, acts of terrorism, or civil unrest, could have a negative effect on our operations and financial results. We rely on the continuous operation of our manufacturing facilities in Vonore, Tennessee, Merritt Island, Florida, and Owosso, Michigan for the production of our products. Any natural disaster or other serious disruption to our facilities due to fire, snow, flood, earthquake, pandemics, civil insurrection or social unrest or any other unforeseen circumstance could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, storms, and catastrophic natural or environmental disasters, as well as acts of terrorism or civil unrest, could disrupt our distribution channel, operations, or supply chain and decrease consumer demand. If a catastrophic event takes place in one of our major sales markets, our sales could be diminished. Additionally, if such an event occurs near our business locations, manufacturing facilities or key supplier facilities, business operations, and/or operating systems could be interrupted. We could be uniquely affected by weather-related catastrophic events, as we have dealers and third-party suppliers located in regions of the United States that have been and may be exposed to damaging storms, such as hurricanes and tornados, floods and environmental disasters. Although preventative measures may help to mitigate damage, the damage and disruption resulting from natural and environmental disasters may be significant. Such disasters can disrupt our consumers, dealers, or suppliers, which can interrupt our operational processes and our sales and profits. Our ability to remain competitive depends on successfully introducing new products and services that meet consumer expectations. We believe that our consumers look for and expect quality, innovation, and advanced features when evaluating and making purchasing decisions about products and services in the marketplace. Our ability to remain competitive and meet our growth objectives may be adversely affected by difficulties or delays in product development, such as an inability to develop viable new products, gain market acceptance of new products, generate sufficient capital to fund new product development, or obtain adequate intellectual property protection for new products. To meet ever-changing consumer demands, both timing of market entry and pricing of new products are critical. As a result, we may not be able to introduce new products that are necessary to remain competitive in all markets that we serve. Furthermore, we must continue to meet or exceed consumers' expectations regarding product quality and after-sales service or our operating results could suffer. Our financial results may be adversely affected by our third-party suppliers' increased costs or inability to adjust for our required production levels due to changes in demand or global supply chain disruptions. We rely on a complex global supply chain of third parties to supply raw materials used in the manufacturing process, including resins, fiberglass, aluminum, lumber and steel, as well as product parts and components. The prices for these raw materials, parts, and components fluctuate depending on market conditions and, in some instances, commodity prices or trade policies, including tariffs. Substantial increases in the prices of raw materials, parts, and components would increase our operating costs, and could reduce our profitability if we are unable to recoup the increased costs through higher product prices or improved operating efficiencies. Similarly, if a critical supplier were to close its operations, cease manufacturing, or otherwise fail to deliver an essential component necessary to our manufacturing operations, that could detrimentally affect our ability to manufacture and sell our products, resulting in an interruption in business operations and/or a loss of sales. In addition, engines used in the manufacturing processes of certain segments are available from a sole-source supplier. Other components used in our manufacturing process, such as boat windshields, towers, and surf tabs may only be available from a limited number of suppliers. Operational and financial difficulties that these or other suppliers may face in the future could adversely affect their ability to supply us with the parts and components we need, which could significantly disrupt our operations. It may be difficult to find a replacement supplier for a limited or sole source raw material, part, or component without significant delay or on commercially reasonable terms. In addition, an uncorrected defect or supplier's variation in a raw material, part, or component, either unknown to us or incompatible with our manufacturing process, could jeopardize our ability to manufacture products. 9 Some additional supply chain disruptions that could impact our operations, impair our ability to deliver products to customers, and negatively affect our financial results include: These risks are exacerbated in the case of single-source suppliers, and the exclusive supplier of a key component could potentially exert significant bargaining power over price, quality, warranty claims, or other terms. We continue to evaluate and shift production; consequently, our need for raw materials and supplies continues to fluctuate. Our suppliers must be prepared to shift operations and, in some cases, hire additional workers and/or expand capacity in order to fulfill our orders and those of other customers. Cost increases, defects, or sustained interruptions in the supply of raw materials, parts, or components due to delayed start-up periods, or sudden changes in requirements, our suppliers experience as they shift production efforts create risks to our operations and financial results. The Company has experienced periodic supply shortages and increases in costs to certain materials. We continue to address these issues by identifying alternative suppliers for key materials and components, working to secure adequate inventories of critical supplies, and continually monitoring the capabilities of our supplier base. In the future, however, we may experience shortages, delayed delivery, and/or increased prices for key materials, parts, and supplies that are essential to our manufacturing operations. Our business and operations are dependent on the expertise of our key contributors, our successful implementation of succession plans, and our ability to attract and retain management employees and skilled labor. The talents and efforts of our employees, particularly key managers, are vital to our success. We have observed an overall tightening and increasingly competitive labor market in recent years, which could inhibit our ability to recruit, train and retain employees we require at efficient costs and could lead to increased costs, such as increased overtime to meet demand and increased wage rates to attract and retain employees. Our management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace. We may be unable to retain them or to attract other highly qualified employees. Failure to hire, develop, and retain highly qualified and diverse employee talent and to develop and implement an adequate succession plan for the management team could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business and our future success. We perform an annual review of management succession plans with our board of directors, including reviewing executive officer and other important positions to substantially mitigate the risk associated with key contributor transitions, but we cannot ensure that all transitions will be implemented successfully. Our ability to continue to execute our growth strategy could potentially be adversely affected by the effectiveness of organizational changes. Any disruption or uncertainty resulting from such changes could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Much of our future success depends on, among other factors, our ability to attract and retain skilled labor, which is critical to our operations. We may experience difficulty maintaining desired staffing levels due to increased competition for employees, higher employee turnover rates and low unemployment rates in many of the geographic areas in which we manufacture or distribute goods. We continually invest in automation and improve our efficiency, but availability and retention of skilled hourly workers remains critical to our operations. In order to manage this risk, we regularly monitor and make improvements to wages and benefit programs, as well as develop and improve recruiting, training, and safety programs to attract and retain an experienced and skilled workforce. We depend on our network of independent dealers which creates additional risks. Substantially all of our sales are derived from our network of independent dealers. Maintaining a reliable network of dealers is essential to our success. Our agreements with dealers in our networks typically provide for one-year terms, although some agreements have longer terms. The loss of one or more of these dealers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The number of dealers supporting our products and the quality of their marketing and servicing efforts are essential to our ability to generate sales. We face competition from other manufacturers in attracting and retaining independent boat dealers. Although our management believes that the quality of our products in the premium performance sport, outboard boat, and sterndrive boat industries should permit us to maintain our relationships with our dealers and our market share position, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or improve our relationships with our dealers or our market share position. In addition, independent dealers in the 10 powerboat industry have experienced significant consolidation in recent years, which could result in the loss of one or more of our dealers in the future if the surviving entity in any such consolidation purchases similar products from a competitor. A significant deterioration in the number or effectiveness of our dealers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Although at present we believe dealer health to be generally favorable, weakening demand for marine products could hurt our dealers’ financial performance. In particular, reduced cash flow from decreases in sales and tightening credit markets could impair dealers' ability to fund operations. Inability to fund operations can force dealers to cease business, and we may be unable to obtain alternate distribution in the vacated market. An inability to obtain alternate distribution could unfavorably affect our net sales through reduced market presence. If economic conditions deteriorate, we anticipate that dealer failures or voluntary market exits would increase, especially if overall retail demand materially declines. Our dealers require adequate liquidity to finance their operations, including purchasing our products. Dealers are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could unfavorably affect their liquidity positions, including, among other things, continued access to adequate financing sources on a timely basis on reasonable terms. These financing sources are vital to our ability to sell products through our network of dealers. Many of our dealers have floor plan financing arrangements with third-party finance companies. Many factors, including creditworthiness of our dealers and overall aging and level of pipeline inventories, continue to influence the availability and terms of financing that our dealers are able to secure, which could cause dealers to shift the timing of purchases or reduce the total amount purchased in a given period of time, adversely affecting sales of our products. In addition, rising interest rates could also incentivize dealers to reduce their inventory levels in order to reduce their interest exposure, which may further adversely impact the sales of our products and our results of operations. We may be required to repurchase inventory of certain dealers. Floor plan financing arrangements with third-party finance companies enable dealers to purchase our products. In connection with these agreements, we may have an obligation to repurchase our products from a finance company under certain circumstances. This obligation is triggered if a dealer defaults on its debt obligations to a finance company. In addition, applicable laws regulating dealer relations may also require us to repurchase our products from our dealers under certain circumstances. In such circumstances, we may not have any control over the timing or amount of any repurchase obligation nor have access to capital on terms acceptable to us to satisfy any repurchase obligation. If we were obligated to repurchase a significant number of units under any repurchase agreement or under applicable dealer laws, our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected. Future declines in marine industry demand could cause an increase in repurchase activity or could require us to incur losses in excess of established reserves. In addition, our cash flow and loss experience could be adversely affected if repurchased inventory is not successfully distributed to other dealers in a timely manner, or if the recovery rate on the resale of the product declines. The finance companies could require changes in repurchase terms that would result in an increase in our contractual obligations. Our industry is characterized by intense competition, which affects our sales and profits. The premium performance sport boat, outboard, and sterndrive boat categories and the powerboat industry as a whole are highly competitive for consumers and dealers. We also compete against consumer demand for used boats. Competition affects our ability to succeed in both the markets we currently serve and new markets that we may enter in the future. Competition is based primarily on brand name, price, product selection, and product performance. We compete with several large manufacturers that may have greater financial, marketing, and other resources than we do and who are represented by dealers in the markets in which we now operate and into which we plan to expand. We also compete with a variety of small, independent manufacturers. We cannot provide assurance that we will not face greater competition from existing large or small manufacturers or that we will be able to compete successfully with new competitors. Our failure to compete effectively with our current and future competitors would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We compete with a variety of other activities for consumers’ scarce leisure time. Our boats are used for recreational and sport purposes, and demand for our boats may be adversely affected by competition from other activities that occupy consumers’ leisure time and by changes in consumer lifestyle, usage pattern, or taste. Similarly, an overall decrease in consumer leisure time may reduce consumers’ willingness to purchase and enjoy our products. Our sales may be adversely impacted by increased consumer preference for used boats or the supply of new boats by competitors in excess of demand. During an economic downturn, we could experience a shift in consumer demand toward purchasing more used boats, primarily because prices for used boats are typically lower than retail prices for new boats. If this were to occur, it could have the effect of reducing demand among retail purchasers for our new boats. Also, while we have taken steps designed to balance production volumes for our boats with demand, our competitors could choose to reduce the price of their products, which could have the effect of reducing demand for our 11 new boats. In addition, as previously mentioned, a shift from traditional fuel-powered boats to electric boats, alternative fuel-powered boats, or other technologies could reduce demand for our boats. Reduced demand for new boats could lead to reduced sales by us, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Significant product repair and/or replacement due to product warranty claims or product recalls could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. We provide a limited warranty for our products. We may provide additional warranties related to certain promotional programs, as well as warranties in certain geographical markets as determined by local regulations and market conditions. Although we employ quality control procedures, sometimes a product is distributed that needs repair or replacement. Our standard warranties require us or our dealers to repair or replace defective products during such warranty periods at no cost to the consumer. Historically, product recalls have been administered through our dealers and distributors. The repair and replacement costs we could incur in connection with a recall could adversely affect our business. In addition, product recalls could harm our reputation and cause us to lose consumers, particularly if recalls cause consumers to question the safety or reliability of our products. An inability to identify and complete targeted acquisitions could negatively impact financial results. We may in the future explore acquisitions and strategic alliances that will enable us to acquire complementary skills and capabilities, offer new products, expand our consumer base, enter new product categories or geographic markets, and obtain other competitive advantages. We cannot provide assurance, however, that we will identify acquisition candidates or strategic partners that are suitable to our business, obtain financing on satisfactory terms, or complete acquisitions or strategic alliances. In managing our acquisition strategy, we conduct rigorous due diligence, involve various functions, and continually review target acquisitions, all of which we believe mitigates some of our acquisition risks. However, we cannot assure that suitable acquisitions will be identified or consummated or that, if consummated, they will be successful. Acquisitions include a number of risks, including our ability to project and evaluate market demand, realize potential synergies and cost savings, and make accurate accounting estimates, as well as diversion of management attention. Uncertainties exist in assessing the value, risks, profitability, and liabilities associated with certain companies or assets, negotiating acceptable terms, obtaining financing on acceptable terms, and receiving any necessary regulatory approvals. As we continue to grow, in part, through acquisitions, our success depends on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these risks. Our failure to successfully do so could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The inability to successfully integrate acquisitions could negatively impact financial results. Our strategic acquisitions pose risks, such as our ability to project and evaluate market demand; maximize potential synergies and cost savings; make accurate accounting estimates; and achieve anticipated business objectives. Acquisitions we may complete in the future, present these and other integration risks, including: If we fail to timely and successfully integrate new businesses into existing operations, we may see higher costs, lost sales, or otherwise diminished earnings and financial results. Negative public perception of our products, our environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices or restrictions on the access or the use of our products in certain locations could materially adversely affect our business or results of operations. Demand for our products depends in part on their acceptance by the public. Public concerns about the environmental impact of our products or their perceived safety, or our ESG practices generally, could result in diminished public perception of the products we sell. Government, media, or activist pressure to limit emissions could also negatively impact consumers’ perceptions of our products. Any decline in the public acceptance of our products could negatively impact their sales or lead to changes in laws, rules and regulations that prevent access to certain locations or restrict use or manner of use in certain areas or during certain times, which could also negatively impact sales. Any material decline in the public acceptance of our products could impact our ability to retain existing consumers or attract new ones which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Our business operations could be negatively impacted by an outage or breach of our information technology systems, network disruptions, or a cybersecurity event. 12 We manage our business operations through a variety of information technology systems and their underlying infrastructure, which we continually enhance to increase efficiency and security. In addition to the disruptions in our information technology systems, cybersecurity threats and sophisticated and targeted cyberattacks pose a risk to our information technology systems. We have established security policies, processes, and defenses, including employee awareness training regarding phishing, malware, and other cyber risks, designed to help identify and protect against intentional and unintentional misappropriation or corruption of our information technology systems and information and disruption of our operations. Additionally, we maintain quarterly discussions with our board of directors to address cyber risks and system and process enhancements. Despite these efforts, our information technology systems may be damaged, disrupted, or shut down due to attacks by unauthorized access, malicious software, computer viruses, undetected intrusion, hardware failures, or other events, and in these circumstances our disaster recovery plans may be ineffective or inadequate. These breaches or intrusions could lead to business interruption, exposure of proprietary or confidential information, data corruption, damage to our reputation, exposure to legal and regulatory proceedings, and other costs. A security breach might also lead to violations of privacy laws, regulations, trade guidelines or practices related to our customers and associates and could result in potential claims from customers, associates, shareholders, or regulatory agencies. Any failure to maintain compliance with such laws, regulations, trade guidelines or practices may cause us to incur significant penalties and generate negative publicity, and may require us to change our business practices, increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business. Such events could adversely impact our reputation, business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, we could be adversely affected if any of our significant customers or suppliers experiences any similar events that disrupt their business operations or damage their reputation. While we maintain monitoring practices and protections of our information technology to reduce these risks and test our systems on an ongoing basis for potential threats, there can be no assurance that these efforts will prevent a cyber-attack or other security breach. We carry cybersecurity insurance to help mitigate the financial exposure and related notification procedures in the event of intentional intrusion; however, there can be no assurance that our insurance will adequately protect against potential losses that could adversely affect our business. We rely on third parties for computing, storage, processing, and similar services. Any disruption of or interference with our use of these third-party services could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. Many of our business systems reside on third-party outsourced cloud infrastructure providers. We are therefore vulnerable to service interruptions experienced by these providers and could experience interruptions, delays, or outages in service availability in the future due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human, hardware or software errors, hosting disruptions, and capacity constraints. While we have mitigation and service redundancy plans in place, outages and/or capacity constraints could still arise from a number of causes such as technical failures, natural disasters, fraud, or internal or third-party security attacks, which could negatively impact our ability to manufacture and/or operate our business. Our credit facilities contain covenants which may limit our operating flexibility; failure to comply with covenants may result in our lenders restricting or terminating our ability to borrow under such credit facilities. In the past, we have relied on our existing credit facilities to provide us with adequate liquidity to operate our business. The availability of borrowing amounts under our credit facilities is dependent on compliance with the debt covenants set forth in our credit agreement. Violation of those covenants, whether as a result of operating losses or otherwise, could result in our lenders restricting or terminating our borrowing ability under our credit facilities. If our lenders reduce or terminate our access to amounts under our credit facilities, we may not have sufficient capital to fund our working capital and other needs, and we may need to secure additional capital or financing to fund our operations or to repay outstanding debt under our credit facilities. We cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in ensuring the availability of amounts under our credit facilities or in raising additional capital, or that any amount, if raised, will be sufficient to meet our cash needs or will be on terms as favorable as those which have been available to us historically. If we are not able to maintain our ability to borrow under our credit facilities, or to raise additional capital when needed, our business and operations will be materially adversely affected. Actual or potential public health emergencies, epidemics, or pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. The impact of actual or potential public health emergencies, epidemics, or pandemics on the Company, our suppliers, dealers, and consumers, and the general economy could be wide-ranging and significant, depending on the nature of the issue, governmental actions taken in response, and the public reaction. The impact of such events could include employee illness, quarantines, cancellation of events and travel, business and school shutdowns, reduction in economic activity, widespread unemployment, and supply chain interruptions, which collectively could cause significant disruptions to global economies and financial markets. In addition, these events could result in future significant volatility in demand, positively or negatively, for our products. Demand volatility may be caused by, among other things: the temporary inability of consumers to purchase our products due to illness, quarantine, or other travel restrictions; dealership closures due to illness or government restrictions; a reduction in boating activity as a result of governmental actions or self-quarantine measures; shifts in demand away from discretionary products; and reduced options for 13 marketing and promotion of products. If such events occur over a prolonged period, they could increase our costs and difficulty of operating our business, including accurately planning and forecasting for our operations and inventory levels, which may adversely impact our results. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in disruption, uncertainty, and volatility in the global financial and credit markets, and similar future events could to the same. Such volatility could impact our access to capital resources and liquidity in the future, including making credit difficult to obtain or only available on less favorable terms. The impact on our operations could also be material. For example, we could experience absenteeism caused by illness or quarantine measures. Additionally, we rely on original equipment manufacturers, dealers, and distributors to market and sell most of our products, and effects on their businesses or financial condition as a result of future pandemics could result in various adverse operational impacts including, but not limited to, lower sales, delayed cash payments, interrupted customer warranty service, and increased credit risk. Risks Relating to Intellectual Property Our success depends on the continued strength of our brands and the value of our brands, and sales of our products could be diminished if we, the athletes who use our products, or the sports and activities in which our products are used are associated with negative publicity. We believe that our brands are a significant contributor to the success of our business and that maintaining and enhancing our brands is important to expanding our consumer and dealer base. Failure to continue to protect our brands may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Negative publicity, including that resulting from severe injuries or death occurring in the sports and activities in which our products are used, could negatively affect our reputation and result in restrictions, recalls, or bans on the use of our products. Further, actions taken by athletes associated with our products that harm the reputations of those athletes could also harm our brand image and adversely affect our financial condition. If the popularity of the sports and activities for which we design, manufacture, and sell products were to decrease as a result of these risks or any negative publicity, sales of our products could decrease, which could have an adverse effect on our net sales, profitability, and operating results. In addition, if we become exposed to additional claims and litigation relating to the use of our products, our reputation may be adversely affected by such claims, whether or not successful, including by generating potential negative publicity about our products, which could adversely impact our business and financial condition. Our intellectual property rights may be inadequate to protect our business. We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, protected design, and trade secret laws; employee and third-party non-disclosure agreements; and other contracts to establish and protect our technology and other intellectual property rights. However, we remain subject to risks, including: Policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and litigating intellectual property claims may result in substantial cost and divert management’s attention. In addition, we may be required to defend our products against patent or other intellectual property infringement claims or litigation. Besides defense expenses and costs, we may not prevail in such cases, forcing us to seek licenses or royalty arrangements from third parties, which we may not be able to obtain on reasonable terms, or subjecting us to an order or requirement to stop manufacturing, using, selling, or distributing products that included challenged intellectual property, which could harm our business and financial results. If third parties claim that we infringe on their intellectual property rights, our financial condition could be adversely affected. 14 We face the risk of claims that we have infringed third parties’ intellectual property rights. Any claims of patent or other intellectual property infringement, even those without merit, could be expensive and time consuming to defend, cause us to cease making, licensing, or using products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property, require us to redesign, re-engineer, or re-brand our products, if feasible, divert management’s attention and resources, or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use a third party’s intellectual property. Any royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. A successful claim of infringement against us could result in our being required to pay significant damages, enter into costly license or royalty agreements, or stop the sale of certain products, any of which could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. While we are not currently involved in any outstanding intellectual property litigation that we believe, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations, we cannot predict the outcome of any pending litigation and an unfavorable outcome could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Risks Relating to Our Regulatory, Accounting, Legal, and Tax Environment International tariffs could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Changes in laws and policies governing foreign trade could adversely affect our business. The institution of global trade tariffs, trade sanctions, new or onerous trade restrictions, embargoes and other stringent government controls carries the risk of negatively affecting global economic conditions, which could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations. Also, certain foreign governments have imposed tariffs on certain U.S. goods and may take additional retaliatory trade actions stemming from the tariffs, which could increase the pricing of our products and result in decreased consumer demand for our products outside of the United States, which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, U.S. initiated tariffs on certain foreign goods, including raw materials, commodities, and products manufactured outside the United States that are used in our manufacturing processes may cause our manufacturing cost to rise, which would have a negative impact on our business and results of operations. An impairment in the carrying value of goodwill, trade names, and other long-lived assets could negatively affect our consolidated results of operations and net worth. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as our trade names, are recorded at fair value at the time of acquisition and are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. In evaluating the potential for impairment of goodwill and trade names, we make assumptions regarding future operating performance, business trends, and market and economic conditions. Such analyses further require us to make certain assumptions about sales, operating margins, growth rates, and discount rates. Uncertainties are inherent in evaluating and applying these factors to the assessment of goodwill and trade name recoverability. We could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill or trade names prior to the annual assessment if we experience business disruptions, unexpected significant declines in operating results, a divestiture of a significant component of our business, or declines in market capitalization. We also continually evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful lives of our definite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets may warrant revision or whether the remaining balance of such assets may not be recoverable. We use an estimate of the related undiscounted cash flow over the remaining life of the asset in measuring whether the asset is recoverable. As of June 30, 2023, the balance of total goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets was $54.5 million, which represents approximately 15 percent of total assets. If the future operating performance of either the Company or individual operating segments is not sufficient, we could be required to record non-cash impairment charges. Impairment charges could substantially affect our reported earnings in the periods such charges are recorded. In addition, impairment charges could indicate a reduction in business value which could limit our ability to obtain adequate financing in the future. Compliance with environmental, health, safety, and other regulatory requirements may increase costs and reduce demand for our products. We are subject to federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations, including those concerning product safety, environmental protection, and occupational health and safety. Some of these laws and regulations require us to obtain permits and limit our ability to discharge hazardous materials into the environment. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in the assessment of fines and penalties, obligations to conduct remedial or corrective actions, or, in extreme circumstances, revocation of our permits or injunctions preventing some or all of our operations. In addition, the components of our boats must meet certain regulatory standards, including stringent air emission standards for boat engines. Failure to meet these standards could result in an inability to sell our boats in key markets, which would adversely affect our business. Moreover, compliance with these regulatory requirements could increase the cost of our products, which in turn, may reduce consumer demand. 15 While we believe that we are in compliance with applicable federal, state, local, and foreign regulatory requirements, and hold all licenses and permits required thereunder, we cannot provide assurance that we will, at all times, be able to continue to comply with applicable regulatory requirements. Compliance with increasingly stringent regulatory and permit requirements may, in the future, cause us to incur substantial capital costs and increase our cost of operations, or may limit our operations, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition. Our manufacturing processes involve the use, handling, storage, and contracting for recycling or disposal of hazardous substances and wastes. The failure to manage or dispose of such hazardous substances and wastes properly could expose us to material liability or fines, including liability for personal injury or property damage due to exposure to hazardous substances, damages to natural resources, or for the investigation and remediation of environmental conditions. Under environmental laws, we may be liable for remediation of contamination at sites where our hazardous wastes have been disposed or at our current or former facilities, regardless of whether such facilities are owned or leased or regardless of whether we were at fault. While we do not believe that we are presently subject to any such liabilities, we cannot assure you that environmental conditions relating to our prior, existing, or future sites or operations or those of predecessor companies will not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition. Additionally, we are subject to laws governing our relationships with employees, including, but not limited to, employment obligations and employee wage, hour, and benefits issues, such as health care benefits. Compliance with these rules and regulations, and compliance with any changes to current regulations, could increase the cost of our operations. We manufacture and sell products that create exposure to potential claims and litigation. Our manufacturing operations and the products we produce could result in product quality, warranty, personal injury, property damage, and other issues, thereby increasing the risk of litigation and potential liability, as well as regulatory fines. We have in the past incurred such liabilities and may in the future be exposed to liability for such claims. We maintain product and general liability insurance of the types and in the amounts that we believe are customary for the industry. However, we may experience material losses in the future, incur significant costs to defend claims or issue product recalls, experience claims in excess of our insurance coverage or that are not covered by insurance, or be subjected to fines or penalties. Our reputation may be adversely affected by such claims, whether or not successful, including potential negative publicity about our products. In addition, if any of our products are, or are alleged to be, defective, we may be required to participate in a recall of that product if the defect or alleged defect relates to safety. These and other claims we may face could be costly to us and require substantial management attention. The nature of our business exposes us to workers’ compensation claims and other workplace liabilities. Certain materials we use require our employees to handle potentially hazardous or toxic substances. While our employees who handle these and other potentially hazardous or toxic materials receive specialized training and wear protective clothing, there is still a risk that they, or others, may be exposed to these substances. Exposure to these substances could result in significant injury to our employees and damage to our property or the property of others, including natural resource damage. Our personnel are also at risk for other workplace related injuries, including slips and falls. We have in the past been, and may in the future be, subject to fines, penalties, and other liabilities in connection with any such injury or damage. Although we currently maintain what we believe to be suitable and adequate insurance in excess of our self-insured amounts, we may be unable to maintain such insurance on acceptable terms or such insurance may not provide adequate protection against potential liabilities. Increases in income tax rates or changes in income tax laws or enforcement could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. Changes in domestic and international tax legislation could expose us to additional tax liability. Although we monitor changes in tax laws and work to mitigate the impact of proposed changes, such changes may negatively impact our financial results. In addition, increases in individual income tax rates would negatively affect our potential consumers’ discretionary income and could decrease the demand for our products. Risks Relating to Ownership of our Common Stock Inefficient or ineffective allocation of capital could adversely affect our operating results and/or stockholder value. We strive to allocate capital in a manner that enhances stockholder value, lowers our cost of capital, or demonstrates our commitment to return excess capital to stockholders, while maintaining our ability to invest in strategic growth opportunities. In July 2023, the board of directors of the Company authorized a new share repurchase program under which the Company may repurchase up to $50 million of its outstanding shares of common stock. The new authorization will become effective upon the expiration of the Company's existing $50 million share repurchase authorization. The Company intends to purchase shares under the repurchase authorization from time to time on the open market at the discretion of management, subject to strategic considerations, market conditions, and other factors. Repurchases under our share repurchase program will reduce the market liquidity for our stock, potentially affecting its trading volatility and price. Future share repurchases will also diminish our cash reserves, which may impact our ability to pursue attractive strategic 16 opportunities. Therefore, if we do not properly allocate our capital or implement a successful cash management strategy, including with respect to returning value to our stockholders through this share repurchase authorization, we may fail to produce optimal financial results and experience a reduction in stockholder value. Shareholders may be diluted by future issuances of common stock in connection with our incentive plans, acquisitions, or otherwise; future sales of such shares in the public market, or the expectations that such sales may occur, could lower our stock price. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue shares of common stock and options, rights, warrants, and appreciation rights relating to common stock for the consideration and on the terms and conditions established by our board of directors in its sole discretion, whether in connection with acquisitions or otherwise. Any common stock that we issue, including under our 2015 Incentive Award Plan or other equity incentive plans that we may adopt in the future, would dilute the percentage ownership of holders of our common stock. We currently do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock. While we have paid dividends in the past, we currently have no intention to pay dividends on our common stock. Any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. Furthermore, our ability to declare and pay dividends may be limited by instruments governing future outstanding indebtedness we may incur. Certain activist shareholder actions could cause us to incur expense and hinder execution of our strategy. We actively engage in discussions with our shareholders regarding further strengthening our Company and creating long-term shareholder value. This ongoing dialogue can include certain divisive activist tactics, which can take many forms. Some shareholder activism, including potential proxy contests, could result in substantial costs, such as legal fees and expenses, and divert management’s and our board of director’s attention and resources from our businesses and strategic plans. Additionally, public shareholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to our future, adversely affect our relationships with dealers, distributors, or consumers, make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel, and cause our stock price to fluctuate based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business. These risks could adversely affect our business and operating results. 17 ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVE D STAFF COMMENTS. None. ITEM 2. PRO PERTIES. As of June 30, 2023, all our MasterCraft boats and trailers are manufactured and lake-tested at our 310,000 square-foot manufacturing facility located on approximately 60 acres of lakefront land in Vonore, Tennessee. We also lease a 3,000 square-foot warehouse facility in West Yorkshire, England for warehousing of parts. All our Crest boats are manufactured in our 270,000 square-foot manufacturing facility located on approximately 63 acres in Owosso, Michigan.

Market Information Our common stock has been publicly traded on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol “MCFT” since July 17, 2015. Prior to that time, there was no public market for our common stock. As of August 25, 2023, we had approximately 12,600 holders of record of our common stock. Dividends We presently do not anticipate declaring or paying cash dividends on our common stock. Any future determination as to the declaration and payment of dividends, will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on then-existing conditions, including our operating results, financial condition, contractual restrictions, capital requirements, business prospects, and other factors our board of directors may deem relevant. See Item 1A “Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Ownership of Our Common Stock.” Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities On June 24, 2021, the board of directors of the Company authorized a stock repurchase program that allows for the repurchase of up to $50.0 million of our common stock during the three-year period ending June 24, 2024. During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, we repurchased approximately $22.9 million and $25.5 million of our common stock, respectively. As of June 30, 2023, the remaining authorization under the program was approximately $1.6 million. During the three months ended June 30, 2023, the Company repurchased the following shares of common stock: Period Total Number of Shares Purchased Average Price Paid Per Share (a)(b) Total Number of Shares Purchased as part of Publicly Announced Program Approximate Dollar Value of Shares that May Yet be Purchased Under the Plan (dollars in thousands) April 3, 2023 - April 30, 2023 59,396 $ 29.29 59,396 $ 6,867 May 1, 2023 - May 28, 2023 112,490 28.24 112,490 3,690 May 29, 2023 - June 30, 2023 74,375 27.63 74,375 1,634 Total 246,261 $ — 246,261 - On July 24, 2023, the board of directors of the Company authorized a new share repurchase program under which the Company may repurchase up to $50 million of its outstanding shares of common stock. The new authorization will become effective upon the expiration of the Company's existing $50 million share repurchase authorization. As of June 30, 2023, there was $1.6 million of availability remaining under the existing stock repurchase program.

The following discussion and analysis should be read together with the sections entitled “Risk Factors” and the financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. In addition, the statements in this discussion and analysis regarding the performance expectations of our business, anticipated financial results, liquidity and the other non-historical statements are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described in “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and in “Risk Factors” above. Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements. This section generally discusses 2023 and 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022. Discussions of 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021 are not included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and can be found in Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022 , which was filed with the SEC on September 9, 2022. Key Performance Measures From time to time we use certain key performance measures in evaluating our business and results of operations and we may refer to one or more of these key performance measures in this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” These key performance measures include: Discontinued Operations On September 2, 2022, the Company completed the sale of its NauticStar business. This business, which was previously reported as the Company's NauticStar segment until fiscal 2023, is being reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. The Company's results for all periods presented, as discussed in Management's Discussion and Analysis, are presented on a continuing operations basis with prior year amounts recast to provide comparability. See Note 3 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on Discontinued Operations. Fiscal 2023 Overview Net sales were up slightly during fiscal 2023 when compared to fiscal 2022. The increase was primarily due to higher pricing to offset inflationary cost pressures, partially offset by a decrease in wholesale volume, dealer incentives and less favorable model mix. We achieved our goal of rebalancing dealer inventories; however, due to a slowing retail environment, the number of wholesale units sold were lower when compared to prior year. Model mix trended towards smaller-sized models as more boats were sold as inventory stock versus retail-sold boats. Also, because of increased dealer inventories, higher interest rates, and an increasingly competitive retail environment, dealer incentives, which include floor plan financing costs and other incentives, have increased. Gross margin declined during fiscal 2023 when compared to fiscal 2022. Offsetting the increased net sales discussed above were increased expenses related to material, labor and overhead inflation. Other contributory expenses included increased insurance premiums and warranty-related costs. Overall, including the impact of dealer incentives in net sales noted above, the gross margin percentage declined 60 basis points. 21 Operating expenses slightly increased during fiscal 2023 when compared to fiscal 2022. Total selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales remained relatively flat during fiscal 2023 when compared to the same prior year period. Results of Operations We derived the consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 from our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected in the future. Consolidated Results 2023 2022 Change % Change (Dollar amounts in thousands) Consolidated statements of operations : NET SALES $ 662,046 $ 641,609 $ 20,437 3.2 % COST OF SALES 492,333 473,419 18,914 4.0 % GROSS PROFIT 169,713 168,190 1,523 0.9 % OPERATING EXPENSES: Selling and marketing 13,808 12,869 939 7.3 % General and administrative 37,034 36,070 964 2.7 % Amortization of other intangible assets 1,956 1,956 — 0.0 % Goodwill impairment — 1,100 (1,100 ) — Total operating expenses 52,798 51,995 803 1.5 % OPERATING INCOME 116,915 116,195 720 0.6 % OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE): Interest expense (2,679 ) (1,471 ) (1,208 ) 82.1 % Interest income 3,351 — 3,351 — INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAX EXPENSE 117,587 114,724 2,863 2.5 % INCOME TAX EXPENSE 27,135 26,779 356 1.3 % NET INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS $ 90,452 $ 87,945 $ 2,507 2.9 % Additional financial and other data: Unit sales volume: MasterCraft 3,407 3,596 (189 ) (5.3 %) Crest 2,836 3,156 (320 ) (10.1 %) Aviara 134 100 34 34.0 % Consolidated unit sales volume 6,377 6,852 (475 ) (6.9 %) Net sales: MasterCraft $ 468,656 $ 466,027 $ 2,629 0.6 % Crest 141,247 140,859 388 0.3 % Aviara 52,143 34,723 17,420 50.2 % Consolidated net sales $ 662,046 $ 641,609 $ 20,437 3.2 % Net sales per unit: MasterCraft $ 138 $ 130 $ 8 6.2 % Crest 50 45 5 11.1 % Aviara 389 347 42 12.1 % Consolidated net sales per unit 104 94 10 10.6 % Gross margin 25.6 % 26.2 % (60) bps Net Sales. Net Sales increased 3.2 percent for fiscal 2023 when compared to fiscal 2022. The increase was a result of higher prices, partially offset by decreased sales volumes, increased dealer incentives, and less favorable model mix. Dealer incentives include higher floor plan financing costs as a result of increased dealer inventories and interest rates, and other incentives as the retail environment becomes more competitive. Gross Margin. Gross Margin percentage declined 60 basis points during fiscal 2023 when compared to fiscal 2022. Lower margins were the result of higher costs related to material and overhead inflation, higher costs from dealer incentives, lower absorption due to decreased sales volumes, less favorable model mix, and increased warranty costs related to prior model year expenses, partially offset by higher prices and improved production efficiencies. Operating Expenses . Operating expenses increased 1.5 percent during fiscal 2023 when compared to the same prior year period. During fiscal 2022, a $1.1 million goodwill impairment charge was recorded in the Aviara segment, as discussed in Note 7 in the Notes to 22 Consolidated Financial Statements. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were relatively flat during fiscal 2023 when compared to the same prior year period. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased $1.2 million primarily due to higher effective interest rates. Interest Income. Interest income of $3.4 million during fiscal 2023 is derived from investments in fiscal 2023 in a portfolio of fixed income securities as part of the Company's cash management strategy. Income Tax Expense. Our consolidated effective income tax rate decreased to 23.1 percent for fiscal 2023 from 23.3 percent for fiscal 2022. See Note 10 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Segment Results MasterCraft Segment The following table sets forth MasterCraft segment results for the fiscal years ended: (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2023 2022 Change % Change Net sales $ 468,656 $ 466,027 $ 2,629 0.6 % Operating income 101,324 105,341 (4,017 ) (3.8 %) Purchases of property, plant and equipment 17,414 6,642 10,772 162.2 % Unit sales volume 3,407 3,596 (189 ) (5.3 %) Net sales per unit $ 138 $ 130 $ 8 6.2 % Net sales increased 0.6 percent during fiscal 2023, when compared to fiscal 2022. The increase was primarily driven by higher selling prices, partially offset by decreased sales volumes, less favorable model mix, and increased dealer incentives. Operating income decreased 3.8 percent during fiscal 2023, when compared to the same prior year period. The overall decrease was driven by higher costs from inflationary pressures, higher dealer incentives, less favorable model mix, decreased sales volumes, and increased warranty costs related to prior model year expenses, partially offset by favorable pricing. Purchases of property, plant, and equipment increased $10.8 million during fiscal 2023, when compared to fiscal 2022. The increase was due to capital spending focused on facility enhancements, strategic initiatives, and information technology. Crest Segment The following table sets forth Crest segment results for the fiscal years ended: (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2023 2022 Change % Change Net sales $ 141,247 $ 140,859 $ 388 0.3 % Operating income 20,106 19,892 214 1.1 % Purchases of property, plant and equipment 7,149 4,193 2,956 70.5 % Unit sales volume 2,836 3,156 (320 ) (10.1 %) Net sales per unit $ 50 $ 45 $ 5 11.1 % Net sales increased 0.3 percent during fiscal 2023, when compared to fiscal 2022, as a result of higher prices, and favorable model mix and options, partially offset by decreased unit volume and increased dealer incentives. Operating income increased 1.1 percent during fiscal 2023, when compared to the same prior year period. The increase was primarily due to higher selling prices, and favorable model mix and options, partially offset by higher costs from inflationary pressures, decreased unit volume, and increased dealer incentives. Purchases of property, plant, and equipment increased $3.0 million during fiscal 2023, when compared to the same prior-year period. The increase was primarily due to capital spending focused on capacity expansion. 23 Aviara Segment The following table sets forth Aviara segment results for the fiscal years ended: (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2023 2022 Change % Change Net sales $ 52,143 $ 34,723 $ 17,420 50.2 % Operating loss (4,515 ) (9,038 ) 4,523 50.0 % Goodwill impairment — 1,100 (1,100 ) — Purchases of property, plant and equipment 5,760 1,461 4,299 294.3 % Unit sales volume 134 100 34 34.0 % Net sales per unit $ 389 $ 347 $ 42 12.1 % Net sales increased 50.2 percent during fiscal 2023, when compared to fiscal 2022, mainly due to increased sales volume and higher selling prices, partially offset by higher dealer incentives. Operating loss decreased 50.0 percent for fiscal 2023, when compared to fiscal 2022. The change was primarily a result of higher prices, improved production efficiencies, and increased sales volume, partially offset by higher costs from inflationary pressures, and increased dealer incentives. Additionally, a goodwill impairment charge was recorded during the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Purchases of property, plant, and equipment increased $4.3 million during fiscal 2023, when compared to fiscal 2022. The increase was due to capital spending focused on capacity expansion and tooling. Non-GAAP Measures EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, EBITDA Margin, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin We define EBITDA as net income from continuing operations, before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA further adjusted to eliminate certain non-cash charges or other items that we do not consider to be indicative of our core and/or ongoing operations. For the periods presented herein, these adjustments include share-based compensation, business development consulting costs, goodwill impairment, Aviara transition costs, and debt refinancing charges, as described in more detail below. We define EBITDA margin and Adjusted EBITDA margin as EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, respectively, expressed as a percentage of Net sales. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income Per Share We define Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share as net income from continuing operations adjusted to eliminate certain non-cash charges or other items that we do not consider to be indicative of our core and/or ongoing operations and reflecting income tax expense on adjusted net income before income taxes at our estimated annual effective tax rate. For the periods presented herein, these adjustments include other intangible asset amortization, share-based compensation, business development consulting costs, goodwill impairment, Aviara transition costs, and debt refinancing charges. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, EBITDA margin, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted Net Income per share, which we refer to collectively as the Non-GAAP Measures, are not measures of net income or operating income as determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. The Non-GAAP Measures are not measures of performance in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, net income per share, or operating cash flows determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of cash flow. We believe that the inclusion of the Non-GAAP Measures is appropriate to provide additional information to investors because securities analysts and investors use the Non-GAAP Measures to assess our operating performance across periods on a consistent basis and to evaluate the relative risk of an investment in our securities. We use Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share to facilitate a comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis from period to period that, when viewed in combination with our results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than does U.S. GAAP measures alone. We believe Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share assists our board of directors, management, investors, and other users of the financial statements in comparing our net income on a consistent basis from period to period because it removes certain non-cash items and other items that we do not consider to be indicative of our core and/or ongoing operations and reflecting income tax expense on adjusted net income before income taxes at our estimated annual effective tax rate. The Non-GAAP Measures have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are: 24 In addition, because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of the Non-GAAP Measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, including companies in our industry. Due to the effects of discontinued operations, as discussed above in “Part I, Item 1. Business,” the Company's non-GAAP financial measures are presented on a continuing operations basis, for all periods presented. The following table presents a reconciliation of net income from continuing operations as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, and net income from continuing operations margin (expressed as a percentage of net sales) to Adjusted EBITDA margin (expressed as a percentage of net sales) for the periods indicated: % of Net % of Net % of Net 2023 sales 2022 sales 2021 sales Net income from continuing operations $ 90,452 13.7% $ 87,945 13.7% $ 58,438 12.5% Income tax expense 27,135 26,779 16,080 Interest expense 2,679 1,471 3,392 Interest income (3,351 ) — — Depreciation and amortization 10,569 9,731 8,368 EBITDA 127,484 19.3% 125,926 19.6% 86,278 18.5% Share-based compensation 3,656 3,510 2,932 Business development consulting costs (a) 312 — — Goodwill impairment (b) — 1,100 — Aviara transition costs (c) — — 2,150 Debt refinancing charges (d) — — 769 Adjusted EBITDA $ 131,452 19.9% $ 130,536 20.3% $ 92,129 19.8% 25 The following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income from continuing operations as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP to Adjusted Net Income for the periods indicated: 2023 2022 2021 (Dollars in thousands, except per share) Net income from continuing operations $ 90,452 $ 87,945 $ 58,438 Income tax expense 27,135 26,779 16,080 Amortization of acquisition intangibles 1,849 1,849 1,849 Share-based compensation 3,656 3,510 2,932 Business development consulting costs (a) 312 — — Goodwill impairment (b) — 1,100 — Aviara transition costs (c) — — 2,150 Debt refinancing charges (d) — — 769 Adjusted Net Income before income taxes 123,404 121,183 82,218 Adjusted income tax expense (e) 28,383 27,872 18,910 Adjusted Net Income $ 95,021 $ 93,311 $ 63,308 Adjusted Net Income per share: Basic $ 5.39 $ 5.06 $ 3.37 Diluted $ 5.35 $ 5.01 $ 3.34 Weighted average shares used for the computation of (e) : Basic Adjusted Net Income per share 17,618,797 18,455,226 18,805,464 Diluted Adjusted Net Income per share 17,765,117 18,636,512 18,951,521 The following table presents the reconciliation of net income from continuing operations per diluted share to Adjusted net income per diluted share for the periods presented: 2023 2022 2021 Net income from continuing operations per diluted share $ 5.09 $ 4.72 $ 3.08 Impact of adjustments: Income tax expense 1.53 1.44 0.85 Amortization of acquisition intangibles 0.10 0.10 0.10 Share-based compensation 0.21 0.19 0.15 Business development consulting costs (a) 0.02 — — Goodwill impairment (b) — 0.06 — Aviara transition costs (c) — — 0.11 Debt refinancing charges (d) — — 0.04 Adjusted Net Income per diluted share before income taxes 6.95 6.51 4.33 Impact of adjusted income tax expense on net income per diluted share before income taxes (e) (1.60 ) (1.50 ) (0.99 ) Adjusted Net Income per diluted share 5.35 $ 5.01 $ 3.34 26 Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary liquidity and capital resource needs are to finance working capital, fund capital expenditures, service our debt, fund potential acquisitions, and fund our stock repurchase program. Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash balance, held-to-maturity securities, cash generated from operating activities, our revolving credit agreement and the refinancing and/or new issuance of long-term debt. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $19.8 million as of June 30, 2023, a decrease of $14.4 million from $34.2 million as of June 30, 2022. Held-to-maturity securities totaled $91.6 million as of June 30, 2023. As of June 30, 2022, there were no outstanding held-to-maturity securities. As of June 30, 2023, we had no amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, leaving $100.0 million of available borrowing capacity. Total debt outstanding under the Term Loan as of June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022 was $53.7 million and $56.5 million, respectively. Refer to Note 9 — Long Term Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. On June 24, 2021, the board of directors of the Company authorized a stock repurchase program that allows for the repurchase of up to $50.0 million of our common stock during the three-year period ending June 24, 2024. During fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, the Company repurchased 872,055 shares and 975,161 shares of common stock for $22.9 million and $25.5 million, respectively, in cash, including related fees and expenses. As of June 30, 2023, there was $1.6 million of availability remaining under the stock repurchase program. On July 24, 2023, the board of directors of the Company authorized a new share repurchase program under which the Company may repurchase up to $50 million of its outstanding shares of common stock. The new authorization will become effective upon the expiration of the Company's existing $50 million share repurchase authorization. We believe our cash balance, investments, cash from operations, and our ability to borrow, will be sufficient to provide for our liquidity and capital resource needs. The following table and discussion below relate to our cash flows from continuing operations for operating, investing, and financing activities: 2023 2022 2021 Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 136,824 $ 82,378 $ 73,961 Investing activities (120,933 ) (12,296 ) (25,219 ) Financing activities (27,148 ) (62,540 ) (17,773 ) Net change in cash from continuing operations $ (11,257 ) $ 7,542 $ 30,969 Fiscal 2023 Cash Flow from Continuing Operations Net cash provided by operating activities was $136.8 million, primarily due to net income, as well as reductions of working capital. Working capital is defined as accounts receivable, income tax receivable, inventories, and prepaid expenses and other current assets net of accounts payable, income tax payable, and accrued expenses and other current liabilities as presented in the consolidated balance sheets, excluding the impact of acquisitions and non-cash adjustments. Favorable working capital change primarily consisted of an increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and a decrease in accounts receivable, offset by a decrease in accounts payable, and an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets. Accrued expenses and other current liabilities increased as a result of an increase in warranty costs and dealer incentives. Accounts receivable decreased primarily as a result of lower sales at the end of the period compared to the end of the prior-year period. Accounts payable decreased as a result of decreased production levels. Prepaid and other current assets increased primarily as a result of higher general insurance premiums. Net cash used in investing activities was $120.9 million, due to net investments in held-to-maturity securities of $90.6 million and $30.3 million of capital expenditures. Our capital spending was focused on tooling, capacity expansion, strategic initiatives, and information technology. Net cash used in financing activities was $27.1 million, which included net payments of $3.0 million on long-term debt and $22.9 million of stock repurchases. Fiscal 2022 Cash Flow from Continuing Operations Net cash provided by operating activities was $82.4 million, mainly due to net income, partially offset by working capital usage. Working capital usage primarily consisted of an increase in inventory, accounts receivable and prepaid and other current assets, partially offset an increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and accounts payable. Inventory increased due to an increase in raw materials to support higher production volumes and to increase safety stock to manage supply chain risk. Accounts receivable increased due to increased sales. Prepaid and other current assets increased due to higher general insurance premiums. Accrued expenses and other 27 current liabilities increased due to an increase in warranty costs and dealer incentives. Accounts payable increased as a result of increased production levels. Net cash used in investing activities was $12.3 million, which included capital expenditures. Our capital spending was focused on expanding our capacity, maintenance capital, and investments in information technology. Net cash used in financing activities was $62.5 million, which included net payments of $36.7 million on long-term debt and $25.5 million of stock repurchases. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company did not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements as of June 30, 2023. Contractual Obligations As of June 30, 2023, the Company’s material cash obligations were as follows: Long-Term Debt Obligations — See Note 9 – Long-Term Debt in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Interest on Long-Term Debt Obligations — As of June 30, 2023, the Company has estimated total interest payments on its outstanding long-term debt obligations of $8.9 million, of which $4.0 million is due during the next 12 months. Interest on variable rate debt instruments was calculated using interest rates in effect for our borrowings as of June 30, 2023 and holding them constant for the life of the instrument. Purchase Commitments — As of June 30, 2023, the Company is committed to purchasing $28.5 million of engines, of which $19.5 million is committed during the next 12 months. See Note 12 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Repurchase Obligations — The Company has reserves to cover potential losses associated with repurchase obligations based on historical experience and current facts and circumstances. We incurred no material impact from repurchase events during fiscal 2023, 2022, or 2021. An adverse change in retail sales, however, could require us to repurchase boats repossessed by floor plan financing companies upon an event of default by any of our dealers, subject in some cases to an annual limitation. See Note 12 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. In addition to the above, we have unrecognized tax benefits that are not reflected here because the Company cannot predict when open income tax years will close with completed examinations. See Note 10 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Significant accounting policies are described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. In the application of these policies, certain estimates are made that may have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Actual results could differ from those estimates and cause our reported net income to vary significantly from period to period. For additional information regarding these policies, see Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Asset Impairment Goodwill The Company reviews goodwill for impairment at its annual impairment testing date, which is June 30, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit may be below its carrying value. As part of the impairment tests, the Company may perform a qualitative, rather than quantitative, assessment to determine whether the fair values of its reporting units are “more likely than not” to be greater than their carrying values. In performing this qualitative analysis, the Company considers various factors, including the effect of market or industry changes and the reporting units' actual results compared to projected results. If the fair value of a reporting unit does not meet the ""more likely than not"" criteria discussed above, the impairment test for goodwill is a quantitative test. This test involves comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, goodwill is not considered impaired. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value then the goodwill is considered impaired and an impairment loss is recognized in an amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of the goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. 28 The Company calculates the fair value of its reporting units considering both the income approach and market approach. The income approach calculates the fair value of the reporting unit using a discounted cash flow method. Internally forecasted future cash flows, which the Company believes reasonably approximate market participant assumptions, are discounted using a weighted average cost of capital (“Discount Rate”) developed for each reporting unit. The Discount Rate is developed using market observable inputs, as well as considering whether or not there is a measure of risk related to the specific reporting unit’s forecasted performance. Fair value under the market approach is determined for each reporting unit by applying market multiples for comparable public companies to the reporting unit’s financial results. The key judgements in these calculations are the assumptions used in determining the reporting unit’s forecasted future performance, including revenue growth and operating margins, as well as the perceived risk associated with those forecasts in determining the Discount Rate, along with selecting representative market multiples. As discussed further in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, during the year ended June 30, 2022, the Company performed a quantitative test and recognized a $1.1 million goodwill impairment charge related to its Aviara reporting unit. As of June 30, 2023, only the MasterCraft reporting unit has a goodwill balance. The fair value of this reporting unit substantially exceeds its carrying value. Other Intangible Assets The Company's primary intangible assets other than goodwill are dealer networks and trade names acquired in business combinations. These intangible assets are initially valued using a methodology commensurate with the intended use of the asset. The dealer networks were valued using an income approach, which requires an estimate or forecast of the expected future cash flows from the dealer network through the application of the multi-period excess earnings approach. The fair value of trade names is measured using a relief-from-royalty approach, a variation of the income approach, which requires an estimate or forecast of the expected future cash flows. This method assumes the value of the trade name is the discounted cash flows of the amount that would be paid to third parties had the Company not owned the trade name and instead licensed the trade name from another company. The basis for future sales projections for these methods are based on internal revenue forecasts by reporting unit, which the Company believes represent reasonable market participant assumptions. The future cash flows are discounted using an applicable Discount Rate as well as any potential risk premium to reflect the inherent risk of holding a standalone intangible asset. The key judgements in these fair value calculations, as applicable, are: assumptions used in developing internal revenue growth and dealer expense forecasts, assumed dealer attrition rates, the selection of an appropriate royalty rate, as well as the perceived risk associated with those forecasts in determining the Discount Rate. The costs of amortizable intangible assets, including dealer networks, are recognized over their expected useful lives, approximately ten years for the dealer networks, using the straight-line method. Intangible assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment using a process similar to that used to evaluate long-lived assets as described below. Intangible assets not subject to amortization are assessed for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that an asset may be impaired. As part of the annual test, the Company may perform a qualitative, rather than quantitative, assessment to determine whether each trade name intangible asset is “more likely than not” impaired. In performing this qualitative analysis, the Company considers various factors, including macroeconomic events, industry and market events and cost related events. If the “more likely than not” criteria is not met, the impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset. As discussed further in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, during the year ended June 30, 2022, the Company recognized $18.5 million in intangible asset impairment charges related to its indefinite lived intangible asset and its dealer network intangible asset within the NauticStar reporting unit. These charges are included in the loss from discontinued operations. Long-Lived Assets The Company assesses the potential for impairment of its long-lived assets if facts and circumstances, such as declines in sales, earnings, or cash flows or adverse changes in the business climate, suggest that they may be impaired. A current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived asset (asset group) will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life will also trigger a review for impairment. The Company performs its assessment by comparing the book value of the asset groups to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset groups. If any impairment in the carrying value of its long-lived assets is indicated, the assets would be adjusted to an estimate of fair value. As discussed further in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, during the year ended June 30, 2022, the Company recognized $5.3 million in long-lived asset impairment charges related to its NauticStar reporting unit. Product Warranties — The Company offers warranties on the sale of certain products for periods of between one and five years from the date of retail sale. These warranties require us or our dealers to repair or replace defective products during the warranty period at no cost to the consumer. We estimate the costs that may be incurred under our basic limited warranty and record as a liability the amount 29 of such costs at the time the product revenue is recognized. The key judgements that affect our estimate for warranty liability include the number of units sold, historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims and cost per claim. We periodically assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as actual claims are determined or as changes in the obligations become reasonably estimable. We also adjust our liability for specific warranty matters when they become known and exposure can be estimated. Future warranty claims may differ from our estimate of the warranty liability, which could lead to changes in the Company’s warranty liability in future periods. Income Taxes— We are subject to income taxes in the United States of America and the United Kingdom. Our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rates, primarily due to a change in state taxes as a result of selling NauticStar, as further described in Note 10 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, we cannot provide assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest. Revenue Recognition — The Company’s revenue is derived primarily from the sale of boats and trailers, marine parts, and accessories to its independent dealers. The Company recognizes revenue when obligations under the terms of a contract are satisfied and control over promised goods is transferred to a customer. For substantially all sales, this occurs when the product is released to the carrier responsible for transporting it to a customer. The Company typically receives payment from the floor plan financing providers within 5 business days of shipment. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for a product. The Company offers dealer incentives that include wholesale rebates, retail rebates and promotions, floor plan reimbursement or cash discounts, and other allowances that are recorded as reductions of revenues in net sales in the consolidated statements of operations. The consideration recognized represents the amount specified in a contract with a customer, net of estimated incentives the Company reasonably expects to pay. The estimated liability and reduction in revenue for dealer incentives is recorded at the time of sale. Subsequent adjustments to incentive estimates are possible because actual results may differ from these estimates if conditions dictate the need to enhance or reduce sales promotion and incentive programs or if dealer achievement or other items vary from historical trends. Accrued dealer incentives are included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Rebates and Discounts Dealers earn wholesale rebates based on purchase volume commitments and achievement of certain performance metrics. The Company estimates the amount of wholesale rebates based on historical achievement, forecasted volume, and assumptions regarding dealer behavior. Rebates that apply to boats already in dealer inventory are referred to as retail rebates. The Company estimates the amount of retail rebates based on historical data for specific boat models adjusted for forecasted sales volume, product mix, dealer and consumer behavior, and assumptions concerning market conditions. The Company also utilizes various programs whereby it offers cash discounts or agrees to reimburse its dealers for certain floor plan interest costs incurred by dealers for limited periods of time, generally ranging up to nine months. Other Revenue Recognition Matters Dealers generally have no right to return unsold boats. Occasionally, the Company may accept returns in limited circumstances and at the Company’s discretion under its warranty policy. The Company may be obligated, in the event of default by a dealer, to accept returns of unsold boats under its repurchase commitment to floor plan financing providers, who are able to obtain such boats through foreclosure. The repurchase commitment is on an individual unit basis with a term from the date it is financed by the lending institution through the payment date by the dealer, generally not exceeding 30 months. The Company accounts for these arrangements as guarantees and recognizes a liability based on the estimated fair value of the repurchase obligation. The estimated fair value takes into account our estimate of the loss we will incur upon resale of any repurchases. The Company accrues the estimated fair value of this obligation based on the age of inventory currently under floor plan financing and estimated credit quality of dealers holding the inventory. Inputs used to estimate this fair value include significant unobservable inputs that reflect the Company’s assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use and, therefore, this liability is classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. We incurred no material impact from repurchase events during fiscal 2023, 2022, or 2021. See Note 12 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on repurchase obligations. 30 New Accounting Pronouncements See “Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Significant Accounting Policies — New Accounting Pronouncements.” ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATI VE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. Market risk represents the risk of changes in the value of market risk sensitive instruments caused by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, interest rates, and commodity prices. Changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in the results of our operations and cash flows. In the ordinary course of business, we are primarily exposed to inflation and interest rate risks. We rely on third parties to supply raw materials used in the manufacturing process, including resins, fiberglass, aluminum, lumber, and steel, as well as product parts and components. The prices for these raw materials, parts, and components fluctuate depending on market conditions and, in some instances, commodity prices or trade policies, including tariffs. Substantial increases in the prices of raw materials, parts, and components would increase our operating costs, and could reduce our profitability if we are unable to recoup the increased costs through higher product prices or improved operating efficiencies. As of June 30, 2023, we had $54.0 million of long-term debt outstanding, bearing interest at the effective interest rate of 6.50%. See Note 9 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding our long-term debt. A hypothetical 1% increase or decrease in interest rates would have resulted in a $0.6 million change to our interest expense for fiscal 2023. ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENT S AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) (of the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. As of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-K Annual Report, we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2023. Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2023. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (""COSO"") in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) . Based on such assessment our management has concluded that, as of June 30, 2023, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria. 31 The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2023, has been audited by our independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, as stated in their report which is included in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f), during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

BRIGHTBILL Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and Chairman of the Board Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, this report has been signed below by the following persons on behalf of the registrant and in the capacities and on the dates indicated.

Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of MasterCraft Boat Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries (the ""Company"") as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the ""financial statements""). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated August 30, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Product Warranties — Refer to Notes 1 and 8 to the financial statements Critical Audit Matter Description The Company offers warranties on the sale of certain of its products for periods of between one and five years. Estimated costs that may be incurred under these warranties are accrued at the time the product revenue is recognized. These estimated costs are based upon the number of units sold, historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims, and the cost per claim. We identified the accrued warranty liability of $24.6 million for the MasterCraft brand as a critical audit matter because of the significant judgments made by management to estimate the anticipated rates of warranty claims and cost per claim related to product warranties at the time the product revenue is recognized. This required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s estimates of the rates and costs of future warranty claims. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our audit procedures related to the accrued warranty liability for the MasterCraft brand included the following, among others: 38 /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP Nashville, Tennessee August 30, 2023 We have served as the Company's auditor since 2019. 39 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of MasterCraft Boat Holdings, Inc. Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of MasterCraft Boat Holdings Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of June 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended June 30, 2023, of the Company and our report dated August 30, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP Nashville, Tennessee August 30, 2023 40 MASTERCRAFT BOAT HOLDINGS, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES N OTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unless otherwise noted, dollars in thousands, except per share data and per unit data) 1 . SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation — The accompanying financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of MasterCraft Boat Holdings, Inc. (“Holdings”) and its wholly owned subsidiaries from the dates of their acquisitions. Holdings and its subsidiaries collectively are referred to herein as the “Company.” All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Holdings has no independent operations and no material assets, other than its wholly owned equity interests in its subsidiaries, as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, and no material liabilities. As of June 30, 2023 and 2022 , Holdings had no material contingencies, long-term obligations, or guarantees other than a guarantee of its subsidiaries’ long-term debt (see Note 9). Discontinued Operations — On September 2, 2022, the Company sold substantially all of the assets and liabilities of its NauticStar segment. The disposal represented the Company's exit from the saltwater and deck boat category, a strategic shift that has a significant effect on the Company's operations and financial results, and as such, qualifies for reporting as discontinued operations. The NauticStar segment results, for the periods presented, are reflected in our consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows as discontinued operations. Additionally, the related assets and liabilities associated with the discontinued operations are classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated balance sheet for the prior period presented (see Note 3). Unless otherwise indicated, the financial disclosures and related information provided herein relate to our continuing operations and we have recast prior period amounts to reflect discontinued operations. Reclassifications — Certain historical amounts have been reclassified in these consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes herewith to conform to current presentation. Use of Estimates — The preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and related disclosures. The Company bases these estimates on historical results and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable. The Company’s most significant financial statement estimates include impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, warranty liability, unrecognized tax positions, inventory repurchase contingent obligations, and impairment of long-lived assets and intangible assets subject to amortization. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Revenue Recognition — The Company’s revenue is derived primarily from the sale of boats and trailers, marine parts, and accessories to its independent dealers. The Company recognizes revenue when obligations under the terms of a contract are satisfied and control over promised goods is transferred to a customer. For substantially all sales, this occurs when the product is released to the carrier responsible for transporting it to a customer. The Company typically receives payment from the floor plan financing providers within 5 business days of shipment. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration it expects to receive in exchange for a product. The Company offers dealer incentives that include wholesale rebates, retail rebates and promotions, floor plan reimbursement or cash discounts, and other allowances that are recorded as reductions of revenues in Net sales in the consolidated statements of operations. The consideration recognized represents the amount specified in a contract with a customer, net of estimated incentives the Company reasonably expects to pay. The estimated liability and reduction in revenue for dealer incentives is recorded at the time of sale. Subsequent adjustments to incentive estimates are possible because actual results may differ from these estimates if conditions dictate the need to enhance or reduce sales promotion and incentive programs or if dealer achievement or other items vary from historical trends. Accrued dealer incentives are included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Rebates and Discounts Dealers earn wholesale rebates based on purchase volume commitments and achievement of certain performance metrics. The Company estimates the amount of wholesale rebates based on historical achievement, forecasted volume, and assumptions regarding dealer behavior. Rebates that apply to boats already in dealer inventory are referred to as retail rebates. The Company estimates the amount of retail rebates based on historical data for specific boat models adjusted for forecasted sales volume, product mix, dealer and consumer behavior, and assumptions concerning market conditions. The Company also utilizes various programs whereby it offers cash discounts or agrees to reimburse its dealers for certain floor plan interest costs incurred by dealers for limited periods of time, generally ranging up to nine months . 45 Shipping and Handling Costs Shipping and handling costs includes those costs incurred to transport product to customers and internal handling costs, which relate to activities to prepare goods for shipment. The Company has elected to account for shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a customer as a fulfillment cost. The Company includes shipping and handling costs, including costs billed to customers, in Cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations. Contract Liabilities A contract liability is created when customers prepay for goods or services prior to the Company transferring control of those goods or services to the customer. The contract liability is reduced once control of the goods is transferred to the customer. The difference between the opening and closing balances of the Company’s contract liabilities primarily results from the timing difference between the Company’s performance and the point at which it receives pre-payment from the customer. Other Revenue Recognition Matters Dealers generally have no right to return unsold boats. Occasionally, the Company may accept returns in limited circumstances and at the Company’s discretion under its warranty policy. The Company may be obligated, in the event of default by a dealer, to accept returns of unsold boats under its repurchase commitment to floor financing providers, who are able to obtain such boats through foreclosure. The repurchase commitment is on an individual unit basis with a term from the date it is financed by the lending institution through the payment date by the dealer, generally not exceeding 30 months. The Company accounts for these arrangements as guarantees and recognizes a liability based on the estimated fair value of the repurchase obligation. The estimated fair value takes into account our estimate of the loss we will incur upon resale of any repurchases. The Company accrues the estimated fair value of this obligation based on the age of inventory currently under floor plan financing and estimated credit quality of dealers holding the inventory. Inputs used to estimate this fair value include significant unobservable inputs that reflect the Company’s assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use and, therefore, this liability is classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The Company has excluded sales and other taxes assessed by a governmental authority in connection with revenue-producing activities from the determination of the transaction price for all contracts. The Company has not adjusted net sales for the effects of a significant financing component because the period between the transfer of the promised goods and the customer's payment is expected to be one year or less. Accounts Receivable — Accounts receivable represents amounts billed to customers under credit terms customary in its industry. The Company normally does not charge interest on its accounts receivable. The Company carries its accounts receivable at face value, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts, which the Company records on a regular basis based upon known bad debt risks and past loss history, customer payment practices and economic conditions. Actual collection experience may differ from the current estimate of net receivables. A change to the allowance for doubtful accounts may be required if a future event or other change in circumstances results in a change in the estimate of the ultimate collectability of a specific account. Amounts recorded as bad debt expense, write-offs, and recoveries were not material for the years ended June 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021 . Cash and Cash Equivalents — The Company considers all highly-liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents. The Company's cash and cash equivalents include cash deposits and money market funds. The Company’s cash deposits may at times exceed federally insured amounts. Held-to-Maturity Securities — The Company invests excess cash balances in short-term debt securities, such as government-sponsored securities, and/or corporate bonds. The Company accounts for its investments in debt securities in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification (""ASC"") 320, Investments — Debt and Equity Securities . We classify our investments in debt securities based on the facts and circumstances present at the time of purchase of the securities. We subsequently reassess the appropriateness of that classification at each reporting date. As of June 30, 2023, all of our investments in debt securities were classified as held-to-maturity and are due to mature within one year (see Note 4). Inputs used to estimate the fair value of our investments include significant other observable inputs and, therefore, are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy . 46 Concentrations of Credit and Business Risk — Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of trade receivables. Credit risk on trade receivables is mitigated as a result of the Company’s use of trade letters of credit, dealer floor plan financing arrangements, and the geographically diversified nature of the Company’s customer base. Supplier Concentrations The Company is dependent on the ability of its suppliers to provide products on a timely basis and on favorable pricing terms. The loss of certain principal suppliers or a significant reduction in product availability from principal suppliers could have a material adverse effect on the Company. Business risk insurance is in place to mitigate the business risk associated with sole suppliers for sudden disruptions such as those caused by natural disasters. The Company is dependent on third-party equipment manufacturers, distributors, and dealers for certain parts and materials utilized in the manufacturing process. During the years ended June 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021 , the Company purchased all engines for its MasterCraft performance sport boats under a supply agreement with a single vendor. Total purchases for all segments from this vendor were $ 47.6 million, $ 45.0 million, and $ 40.6 million for the years ended June 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. During the years ended June 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021 , the Company purchased outboard engines for its Aviara boats and a majority of the engines for its Crest boats under a supply agreement with a single vendor. Total purchases from this vendor were $ 31.0 million, $ 34.0 million, and $ 22.7 million for the years ended June 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021 , respectively. Inventories — Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value and are shown net of an inventory allowance in the consolidated balance sheet. Inventory cost includes material, labor, and manufacturing overhead and is determined based on the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Provisions are made as necessary to reduce inventory amounts to their net realizable value or to provide for obsolete inventory. Property, Plant, and Equipment — Property, plant, and equipment are recorded at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives. Repairs and maintenance are charged to operations as incurred, and expenditures for additions and improvements that increase the asset’s useful life are capitalized. For the years ended June 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021, ranges of asset lives used for depreciation purposes are: Buildings and improvements 7 - 40 years Machinery and equipment 3 - 7 years Furniture and fixtures 3 - 7 years Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets — The Company does not amortize goodwill and other purchased intangible assets with indefinite lives, which are primarily related to trade names. The Company’s intangible assets with finite lives consist primarily of dealer networks and are carried at their estimated fair values at the time of acquisition, less accumulated amortization. Amortization is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets (see Note 7). Intangible assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment using a process similar to that used to evaluate long-lived assets described below. The Company has three reporting units, MasterCraft, Crest, and Aviara, which each relate to an operating segment as described in Note 14. As of June 30, 2023, all of the Company’s goodwill relates to the MasterCraft reporting unit and all of the Company’s other intangible assets relate to the MasterCraft and Crest reporting units. Goodwill Goodwill results from the excess of purchase price over the net identifiable assets of businesses acquired. The Company reviews goodwill for impairment annually, at its fiscal year-end annual impairment testing date, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit may be below its carrying value. As part of the impairment tests, the Company may perform a qualitative, rather than quantitative, assessment to determine whether the fair values of its reporting units are “more likely than not” to be greater than their carrying values. In performing this qualitative analysis, the Company considers various factors, including the effect of market or industry changes and the reporting units' actual results compared to projected results. If the fair value of a reporting unit does not meet the ""more likely than not"" criteria discussed above, the impairment test for goodwill is a quantitative test. This test involves comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, goodwill is not considered impaired. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value then the goodwill is considered impaired and an impairment loss is recognized in an amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of the goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The Company calculates the fair value of its reporting units by considering both the income approach and market approach. The income approach calculates the fair value of the reporting unit using a discounted cash flow method. Internally forecasted future cash flows, which the Company believes reasonably approximate market participant assumptions, are discounted using a weighted average cost of capital (“Discount Rate”) developed for each reporting unit. The Discount Rate is developed using observable market inputs, as well as 47 considering whether or not there is a measure of risk related to the specific reporting unit’s forecasted performance. Fair value under the market approach is determined for each unit by applying market multiples for comparable public companies to the unit’s financial results. The key judgements in these calculations are the assumptions used in determining the reporting unit’s forecasted future performance, including revenue growth and operating margins, as well as the perceived risk associated with those forecasts in determining the Discount Rate, along with selecting representative market multiples. The Company recognized a $ 1.1 million goodwill impairment charge within the Aviara segment during the year ended June 30, 2022 (see Note 7). Other Intangible Assets The Company's primary intangible assets other than goodwill are dealer networks and trade names acquired in business combinations. These intangible assets are initially valued using a methodology commensurate with the intended use of the asset. The dealer networks were valued using an income approach, which requires an estimate or forecast of the expected future cash flows from the dealer network through the application of the multi-period excess earnings approach. The fair value of trade names is measured using a relief-from-royalty approach, a variation of the income approach, which requires an estimate or forecast of the expected future cash flows. This method assumes the value of the trade name is the discounted cash flows of the amount that would be paid to third parties had the Company not owned the trade name and instead licensed the trade name from another company. The basis for future sales projections for these methods are internal revenue forecasts by reporting unit, which the Company believes represent reasonable market participant assumptions. The future cash flows are discounted using an applicable Discount Rate as well as any potential risk premium to reflect the inherent risk of holding a standalone intangible asset. The key judgements in these fair value calculations, as applicable, are: assumptions used in developing internal revenue growth and dealer expense forecasts, assumed dealer attrition rates, the selection of an appropriate royalty rate, as well as the perceived risk associated with those forecasts in determining the Discount Rate. The costs of amortizable intangible assets, including dealer networks, are recognized over their expected useful lives, approximately ten years for the dealer networks, using the straight-line method. Intangible assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment using a process similar to that used to evaluate long-lived assets described below. Intangible assets not subject to amortization are assessed for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that an asset may be impaired. As part of the annual test, the Company may perform a qualitative, rather than quantitative, assessment to determine whether each trade name intangible asset is “more likely than not” impaired. In performing this qualitative analysis, the Company considers various factors, including macroeconomic events, industry and market events and cost related events. If the “more likely than not” criteria is not met, the impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset. The Company recognized $ 18.5 million in other intangible asset impairment charges related to the NauticStar reporting unit during the year ended June 30, 2022. These charges are included in the loss from discontinued operations (see Note 3). Long-Lived Assets Other than Intangible Assets — The Company assesses the potential for impairment of its long-lived assets if facts and circumstances, such as declines in sales, earnings, or cash flows or adverse changes in the business climate, suggest that they may be impaired. A current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived asset (asset group) will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life will also trigger a review for impairment. The Company performs its assessment by comparing the book value of the asset groups to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset groups. If any impairment in the carrying value of its long-lived assets is indicated, the assets would be adjusted to an estimate of fair value. The Company recognized $ 5.3 million in long-lived asset impairment charges related to the NauticStar reporting unit during the year ended June 30, 2022. These charges are included in the loss from discontinued operations (see Note 3). Product Warranties — The Company offers warranties on the sale of certain products for periods of between one and five years . These warranties require us or our dealers to repair or replace defective products during the warranty period at no cost to the consumer. We estimate the costs that may be incurred under our basic limited warranty and record as a liability the amount of such costs at the time the product revenue is recognized. Factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of units sold, historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims, and cost per claim. We periodically assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as actual claims are determined or as changes in the obligations become reasonably estimable. We also adjust our liability for specific warranty matters when they become known, and the exposure can be estimated. Future warranty claims may differ from our estimate of the warranty liability, which could lead to changes in the Company’s warranty liability in future periods. 48 Income Taxes — Income tax expense is the total of the current year income tax due or refundable and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Company records its global tax provision based on the respective tax rules and regulations for the jurisdictions in which it operates. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are the expected future tax amounts for the temporary differences between carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities, computed using enacted tax rates. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. Significant judgment is required in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets. The realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income. A tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is “more likely than not” that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the “more likely than not” test, no tax benefit is recorded. The Company recognizes interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. In determining the amount of current and deferred tax the Company takes into account the impact of uncertain tax positions and whether additional taxes, interest and penalties may be due. The Company believes that its accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open tax years based on its assessment of many factors, including interpretations of tax law and prior experience. This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of judgments about future events. New information may become available that causes the Company to change its judgment regarding the adequacy of existing tax liabilities; such changes to tax liabilities will have an impact on tax expense in the period that such a determination is made. Research and Development — Research and development expenditures are expensed as incurred. Research and development expense for the years ended June 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021 was $ 8.3 million , $ 7.2 million , and $ 5.8 million , respectively, and is included in Operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. Self-Insurance — The Company is self-insured for certain losses relating to product liability claims and employee medical claims. The Company has purchased stop-loss coverage in order to limit its exposure to any significant levels for these matters. Losses are accrued based on the Company’s estimates of the aggregate liability for self-insured claims incurred using certain actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and the Company’s historical experience. Deferred Debt Issuance Costs — Certain costs incurred to obtain financing are capitalized and amortized over the term of the related debt using the effective interest method. For the year ended June 30, 2021, the Company incurred deferred financing costs of $ 0.6 million. For the years ended June 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021 , the Company recorded related amortization expense of $ 0.2 million, $ 0.2 million, and $ 0.6 million, respectively. Additionally, for the year ended June 30, 2021, the Company recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $ 0.7 million related to the debt refinancing in fiscal 2021. See Note 9 – Long-Term Debt for a discussion on debt issuance costs. Share-Based Compensation — The Company records amounts for all share-based compensation, including grants of restricted stock awards and performance stock units over the vesting period in the consolidated statements of operations based on their fair values at the date of the grant. Forfeitures of share-based compensation, if any, are recognized as they occur. Share-based compensation costs are included in Selling and marketing and General and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of Operations. See Note 11 – Share-Based Compensation for a description of the Company's accounting for share-based compensation plans. Advertising — Advertising costs are expensed when the advertising first takes place. Advertising expense recognized during the years ended June 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021, was $ 5.7 million , $ 4.4 million , and $ 4.4 million , respectively, and is included in Selling and marketing expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. 49 Fair Value Measurements — The Company measures certain of its financial assets and liabilities at fair value and utilizes the established framework for measuring fair value and disclosing information about fair value measurements. Fair value is the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair values: Level 1 — Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity has the ability to access as of the measurement date. Level 2 — Significant other observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. Level 3 — Significant unobservable inputs that reflect a company’s own assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. When measuring fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. When possible, the Company looks to active and observable markets to price identical assets. When identical assets are not traded in active markets, the Company looks to market observable data for similar assets. The Company’s most significant financial asset or liability measured at fair value on a recurring basis is its inventory repurchase contingent obligation (see “Revenue Recognition - Other Revenue Recognition Matters” and Note 12). The non-recurring fair value measurement related to the impairment of goodwill recorded in fiscal 2022 is a level 3 measurement. Fair Value of Financial Instruments — The carrying amounts of the Company’s financial instruments, consisting of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and other liabilities, approximate their estimated fair values due to the relative short-term nature of the amounts. The carrying amount of debt approximates fair value due to variable interest rates at customary terms and rates the Company could obtain in current financing. Earnings Per Common Share — Basic earnings per common share reflects reported earnings divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted earnings per common share include the effect of dilutive stock options, restricted stock awards, and performance stock units unless inclusion would not be dilutive. Postretirement Benefits — The Company has a defined contribution plan and makes contributions including matching and discretionary contributions which are based on various percentages of compensation, and in some instances are based on the amount of the employees' contributions to the plans. The expense related to the defined contribution plan was $ 1.9 million, $ 1.7 million, and $ 1.4 million for the years ended June 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021 , respectively. New Accounting Pronouncements Issued And Adopted Income Taxes — In December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. ASU 2019-12 simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to general principles in Income Taxes (Topic 740). It also clarifies and amends existing guidance to improve consistent application. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. The adoption of this standard did not have an impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Reference Rate Reform — In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. ASU 2020-04 provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions, subject to meeting certain criteria, that reference London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. An entity may apply ASU 2020-04 as of any date from the beginning of an interim period that includes or is subsequent to March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. The adoption of this standard did not have an impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. 2. REVENUE RECOGNITION The following tables present the Company’s net sales by major product category for each reportable segment. Year Ended June 30, 2023 MasterCraft Crest Aviara Total Major Product Categories: Boats and trailers $ 452,903 $ 139,654 $ 52,143 $ 644,700 Parts 13,922 1,070 — 14,992 Other revenue 1,831 523 — 2,354 Total $ 468,656 $ 141,247 $ 52,143 $ 662,046 50 Year Ended June 30, 2022 MasterCraft Crest Aviara Total Major Product Categories: Boats and trailers $ 450,734 $ 138,841 $ 34,723 $ 624,298 Parts 13,170 962 — 14,132 Other revenue 2,123 1,056 — 3,179 Total $ 466,027 $ 140,859 $ 34,723 $ 641,609 For Year Ended June 30, 2021 MasterCraft Crest Aviara Total Major Product Categories: Boats and trailers $ 336,785 $ 101,208 $ 12,462 $ 450,455 Parts 12,934 1,091 — 14,025 Other revenue 1,093 389 — 1,482 Total $ 350,812 $ 102,688 $ 12,462 $ 465,962 For fiscal 2023 , the Company’s top ten dealers accounted for approximately 40 % of our net sales and one of our dealers individually accounted for 14.9 %, or approximately $ 98.6 million. For fiscal 2022 and 2021, the Company's top ten dealers accounted for approximately 30 % of our net sales and none of our dealers individually accounted for more than 10 % of our total net sales. On a consolidated basis, sales outside of North America accounted for 4.6 %, 5.5 %, and 5.1 % of the Company’s net sales for the years ended June 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The Company had no significant concentrations of sales to individual dealers or in countries outside of North America during the years ended June 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021. Contract Liabilities As of June 30, 2023 , the Company had $ 3.3 million of contract liabilities associated with customer deposits and services reported in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities and Other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. The Company expects to recognize $ 1.5 million of this amount during the year ending June 30, 2024, and $ 1.8 million thereafter. As of June 30, 2022 , total contract liabilities were $ 1.4 million. During the year ended June 30, 2023, all of this amount was recognized as revenue. See Note 1 for a description of the Company’s significant revenue recognition policies and Note 14 for a description of the Company’s segments. 3. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS On September 2, 2022, the Company sold its NauticStar business to certain affiliates of Iconic Marine Group, LLC (""Purchaser""). Pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement, substantially all of the assets of NauticStar were sold, including, among other things, all of the issued and outstanding membership interests in its wholly-owned subsidiary NS Transport, LLC, all owned real property, equipment, inventory, intellectual property and accounts receivable, and the Purchaser assumed substantially all of the liabilities of NauticStar, including, among other things, product liability and warranty claims. In conjunction with the purchase agreement, the Company entered into a joint employer services agreement and a transition services agreement, which provided certain services to the Purchaser for various periods of time after the sale. Both agreements ended during the second quarter of fiscal 2023. These agreements did not a have a material impact on expenditures, earnings, nor cash flows during the year ended June 30, 2023. Further, the Company entered into the Second Amendment to the Credit Agreement as described further in Note 9 related to waivers of restrictions within the Credit Agreement, as amended, on the sale of assets. During the year ended June 30, 2023 , the Company recognized a $ 22.5 million loss on sale, subject to further changes based upon a customary working capital adjustment which is currently undergoing arbitration. The outcome of this matter is uncertain at this time. Furthermore, assets and liabilities retained, primarily related to certain claims, are subject to change, with activity after the date of sale being recorded as discontinued operations. 51 The following table summarizes the results of discontinued operations for the following periods: Years Ended June 30, 2023 2022 2021 NET SALES $ 7,766 $ 66,253 $ 59,846 COST OF SALES 10,253 72,081 55,006 GROSS LOSS ( 2,487 ) ( 5,828 ) 4,840 OPERATING EXPENSES: Selling, general and administrative 2,859 6,645 5,538 Amortization of other intangible assets - 2,032 1,992 Impairments - 23,833 - Total operating expenses 2,859 32,510 7,530 OPERATING LOSS ( 5,346 ) ( 38,338 ) ( 2,690 ) Loss on sale of discontinued operations ( 22,487 ) — — LOSS BEFORE INCOME TAX BENEFIT ( 27,833 ) ( 38,338 ) ( 2,690 ) INCOME TAX BENEFIT 6,318 8,607 422 LOSS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, NET OF TAX $ ( 21,515 ) $ ( 29,731 ) $ ( 2,268 ) The following table summarizes the assets and liabilities associated with discontinued operations: June 30, 2022 CURRENT ASSETS: Accounts receivable, net of allowance $ 3,130 Inventories, net 20,044 Other current assets 434 Total current assets classified as discontinued operations $ 23,608 NON-CURRENT ASSETS: Property, plant and equipment, net $ 5,924 Other long-term assets 63 Total non-current assets classified as discontinued operations $ 5,987 CURRENT LIABILITIES: Accounts payable $ 4,675 Accrued expenses and other current liabilities 3,212 Total current liabilities classified as discontinued operations $ 7,887 NauticStar Impairment Activity In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022, the NauticStar reporting unit recorded unplanned negative operating results despite ongoing efforts to improve sales volumes and yield more favorable margins, including the engagement of third-party consulting resources. These results, combined with the outlook for further supply chain disruptions, labor challenges, and higher costs from inflationary pressures, resulted in an impairment trigger in the fourth quarter related to the NauticStar reporting unit’s intangible and other long-lived assets. Based on our evaluation of projected future cash flows, we concluded that the trade name intangible asset of $ 8.0 million was fully impaired as of June 30, 2022. We then performed a probability-weighted undiscounted cash flow analysis for the asset group related to the NauticStar reporting unit that considered projected cash flows from continuing to operate the assets through their remaining estimated useful lives, a potential sale, and a potential exit of the business other than through a sale and concluded that the carrying value of the asset group was not recoverable. The fair value of the finite-lived dealer network intangible asset was estimated using these cash flows, resulting in a full impairment of $ 10.5 million. The fair value of the fixed assets, which primarily comprised of machinery and equipment, such as tooling, was estimated using liquidation values, resulting in an impairment charge of $ 5.3 million against the asset group’s fixed assets. As a result of our impairment analyses, we recorded total impairment charges of $ 23.8 million related to the NauticStar reporting unit’s intangible and fixed assets during the year ended June 30, 2022, which are included in Impairments in the results of discontinued operations above. 52 4. HELD-TO-MATURITY SECURITIES During the year ended June 30, 2023, we invested a portion of our cash and cash equivalents in short-term investments, which primarily consist of investment grade corporate bonds and U.S. treasury bills. We have the ability and intention to hold these investments until maturity and therefore have classified these investments as held-to-maturity and recorded them at amortized cost and presented them in “Held-to-maturity securities” on our consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2023. The income recognized for these investments is recorded within Interest income on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of June 30, 2022, there were no outstanding held-to-maturity investments. The following is a summary of investments as of June 30, 2023: Amortized Gross Gross Estimated Cost / Net Unrealized Unrealized Fair Carrying Amount Gains Losses Value Held-to-maturity securities: Fixed income securities: Corporate bonds $ 81,743 $ 1 $ ( 160 ) $ 81,584 U.S. treasury bills 9,817 31 ( 1 ) 9,847 Total held-to-maturity securities $ 91,560 $ 32 $ ( 161 ) $ 91,431 5. INVENTORIES Inventories consisted of the following: June 30, June 30, 2023 2022 Raw materials and supplies $ 40,201 $ 45,021 Work in process 9,465 7,634 Finished goods 10,335 7,710 Obsolescence reserve ( 1,703 ) ( 1,770 ) Total inventories $ 58,298 $ 58,595 6. PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT Property, plant, and equipment, net consisted of the following: June 30, June 30, 2023 2022 Land and improvements $ 10,456 $ 6,367 Buildings and improvements 46,759 35,379 Machinery and equipment 40,632 39,457 Furniture and fixtures 5,284 3,394 Construction in progress 10,180 6,315 Total property, plant, and equipment 113,311 90,912 Less accumulated depreciation ( 35,390 ) ( 35,089 ) Property, plant, and equipment — net $ 77,921 $ 55,823 Depreciation expense for the years ended June 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021 was $ 8.6 million, $ 7.7 million, and $ 6.4 million, respectively. Property, plant, and equipment, net increased mainly due to capital spending focused on tooling, capacity expansion, strategic initiatives, and information technology. 53 7. GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS Goodwill and Other Intangible Asset Impairment See Note 1 for a discussion of the methods used to determine the fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets. In assessing the need for goodwill and intangible impairment, management utilizes a number of estimates, including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, transactions and marketplace data. Accordingly, these fair value measurements fall in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Fiscal 2022 Goodwill Impairment In fiscal 2022, the Company realigned its reportable segments. As a result of the change in segments, the Company reallocated the goodwill recorded in the MasterCraft reporting unit to the two separate MasterCraft and Aviara reporting units. In conjunction with the reallocation of goodwill, the Company tested goodwill at our MasterCraft and Aviara segments and determined the carrying value of the Aviara reporting unit to be in excess of the fair value. Consequently, a $ 1.1 million impairment charge was recognized for our Aviara reporting unit in fiscal 2022. Goodwill Goodwill reallocation and impairment charge for the year ended June 30, 2022, were as follows: MasterCraft Aviara Total Goodwill, net at June 30, 2021 $ 29,593 $ — $ 29,593 Goodwill reallocation ( 1,100 ) 1,100 — Impairment loss — ( 1,100 ) ( 1,100 ) Goodwill, net at June 30, 2022 $ 28,493 $ — $ 28,493 As of June 30, 2023, our annual impairment test date, the Company performed a qualitative assessment and identified no events or circumstances that indicated that there existed a more likely than not probability of impairment of goodwill within our MasterCraft segment. The following table presents the carrying amounts of goodwill as of June 30, 2023 and 2022 for each of the Company's reportable segments. Gross Amount Accumulated Impairment Losses Total MasterCraft $ 28,493 $ - $ 28,493 Crest 36,238 ( 36,238 ) - Aviara 1,100 ( 1,100 ) - Total $ 65,831 $ ( 37,338 ) $ 28,493 Other Intangible Assets The following table presents the carrying amount of Other intangible assets, net as of June 30, 2023 and 2022.

Amortization expense related to Other intangible assets, net for each of the years ended June 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $ 2.0 million. The following table presents estimated future amortization expense for the next five fiscal years and thereafter. Fiscal years ending June 30, 2024 $ 1,812 2025 1,800 2026 1,800 2027 1,800 2028 1,800 and thereafter 450 Total $ 9,462 8. ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES Accrued expenses and other current liabilities consisted of the following: June 30, June 30, 2023 2022 Warranty $ 31,780 $ 25,824 Dealer incentives 24,987 15,508 Compensation and related accruals 5,838 4,908 Self-insurance 1,586 1,171 Inventory repurchase contingent obligation 1,515 661 Contract liabilities 1,477 1,447 Liabilities retained associated with discontinued operations 690 — Other 4,623 4,918 Total accrued expenses and other current liabilities $ 72,496 $ 54,437 Accrued warranty liability activity was as follows: June 30, June 30, 2023 2022 Balance at the beginning of the period $ 25,824 $ 20,655 Provisions 15,302 12,520 Payments made ( 12,899 ) ( 9,057 ) Aggregate changes for preexisting warranties 3,553 1,706 Balance at the end of the period $ 31,780 $ 25,824 9. LONG-TERM DEBT Long-term debt outstanding was as follows: June 30, June 30, 2023 2022 Term loan $ 54,000 $ 57,000 Debt issuance costs on term loan ( 324 ) ( 451 ) Total debt 53,676 56,549 Less current portion of long-term debt 4,500 3,000 Less current portion of debt issuance costs on term loan ( 119 ) ( 127 ) Long-term debt, net of current portion $ 49,295 $ 53,676 On June 28, 2021, the Company entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of certain financial institutions (the “Credit Agreement”). The Credit Agreement provides the Company with a $ 160.0 million senior secured credit facility, consisting of a $ 60.0 million term loan (the “Term Loan”) and a $ 100.0 million revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”). The Credit Agreement refinanced and replaced the Fourth Amended Credit Agreement, which had been in place prior to the Credit Agreement and 55 provided the Company with a $ 190.0 million senior secured credit facility, consisting of a $ 75.0 million term loan, and $ 80.0 million term loan, and a $ 35.0 million revolving credit facility. The Credit Agreement is secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the Company’s assets. The Credit Agreement contains a number of covenants that, among other things, restrict the Company’s ability to, subject to specified exceptions, incur additional debt; incur additional liens and contingent liabilities; sell or dispose of assets; merge with or acquire other companies; liquidate or dissolve; engage in businesses that are not in a related line of business; make loans, advances or guarantees; pay dividends or make other distributions; engage in transactions with affiliates; and make investments. The Company is also required to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum net leverage ratio. As a result of entering into the Credit Agreement, the Company recognized a $ 0.7 million loss on early extinguishment of debt during the year ended June 30, 2021 related to unamortized debt issuance costs of the previously existing credit facility. On August 31, 2022, the Company entered into the Second Amendment to the Credit Agreement to obtain the necessary consents and waivers to the restrictions described above in the covenants of the Credit Agreement, as related to the sale of the NauticStar business on September 2, 2022, as discussed in Note 3. The Credit Agreement, as amended, bears interest, at the Company’s option, at either the prime rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.25 % to 1.00 % or at an adjusted benchmark rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.25 % to 2.00 %, in each case based on the Company’s net leverage ratio. The Company is also required to pay a commitment fee for any unused portion of the revolving credit facility ranging from 0.15 % to 0.30 % based on the Company’s net leverage ratio. As of June 30, 2023 and 2022 , the effective interest rate on borrowings outstanding was 6.50 % and 2.94 %, respectively. The Credit Agreement will mature and all remaining amounts outstanding thereunder will be due and payable on June 28, 2026. As of June 30, 2023, the Company was in compliance with its financial covenants under the Credit Agreement. Revolving Credit Facility In conjunction with the Credit Agreement entered into on June 28, 2021, the Company drew $ 33.7 million on its Revolving Credit Facility. Drawn amounts were used to repay a same amount of outstanding borrowings under the term loans under the Fourth Amended Credit Agreement. As of June 30, 2022 , the Company had repaid all outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and had remaining availability of $ 100.0 million. The Company has not utilized the revolver as of June 30, 2023, and still holds availability of $ 100.0 million. Maturities for the Term Loan subsequent to June 30, 2023 are as follows: 2024 $ 4,500 2025 4,500 2026 45,000 Total $ 54,000 10. INCOME TAXES The Company's sources of earnings before income taxes are primarily derived in the U.S. Earnings in jurisdictions outside of the U.S. were not significant during each of the years ended June 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021. For the years ended June 30, the components of the provision for income taxes for continuing operations are as follows: 2023 2022 2021 Current income tax expense: Federal $ 25,115 $ 22,563 $ 12,795 State 5,728 5,680 3,276 Total current tax expense $ 30,843 $ 28,243 $ 16,071 Deferred tax (benefit) expense: Federal $ ( 3,739 ) $ ( 1,044 ) $ 858 State 31 ( 413 ) ( 849 ) Foreign - ( 7 ) - Total deferred tax expense (benefit) ( 3,708 ) ( 1,464 ) 9 Income tax expense (benefit) $ 27,135 $ 26,779 $ 16,080 56 The difference between the statutory and the effective federal tax rate related to continuing operations for the periods below is attributable to the following: 2023 2022 2021 Statutory income tax rate 21.00 % 21.00 % 21.00 % State taxes (net of federal income tax benefit and valuation allowance) 2.20 % 1.76 % 1.21 % Tax credits ( 0.93 %) ( 0.66 %) ( 0.77 %) Change in valuation allowance — ( 0.03 %) 0.19 % Permanent differences ( 0.90 %) ( 0.69 %) ( 0.74 %) Uncertain tax positions 1.90 % 1.99 % 0.74 % Other ( 0.19 %) ( 0.03 %) ( 0.05 %) Effective income tax rate 23.08 % 23.34 % 21.58 % As of June 30, 2023, and 2022, a summary of the significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities was as follows: 2023 2022 Deferred tax assets: Intangible asset basis difference $ 3,224 $ 15,886 Warranty reserves 7,448 6,515 Accrued selling 2,177 390 Capitalized research costs 1,835 — Stock compensation 1,463 1,183 Unrecognized tax benefits 1,328 1,145 Inventory 504 1,142 Net operating loss 750 705 Other 1,463 943 Total deferred tax assets 20,192 27,909 Valuation allowance ( 2 ) ( 2 ) Total deferred tax assets, net of the valuation allowance 20,190 27,907 Deferred tax liabilities: Depreciation ( 6,201 ) ( 5,404 ) Other ( 1,561 ) ( 978 ) Total deferred tax liabilities ( 7,762 ) ( 6,382 ) Net deferred tax assets $ 12,428 $ 21,525 As of June 30, 2023 , the Company has state net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards of $ 16.7 million. Of this amount, $ 1.0 million expire in varying years ranging from June 30, 2025 to June 30, 2038, while the remainder can be carried forward indefinitely. Unrecognized Tax Benefits A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits, excluding accrued amounts for interest and penalties, is as follows: 2023 2022 Balance at July 1 $ 5,513 $ 3,304 Additions based on tax positions related to the current year 1,289 2,004 Additions for tax positions of prior years 30 296 Reductions for tax positions of prior years ( 600 ) ( 91 ) Balance at June 30 $ 6,232 $ 5,513 Of this total, $ 5.4 million and $ 4.7 million as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, represent the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably affect the effective income tax rate in future periods. The total amount of interest and penalties recorded in the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended June 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021 was an expense of $ 0.2 million, an expense of $ 0.2 million, and a benefit of $ 0.2 million, respectively. The amounts accrued for interest and penalties at June 30, 2023 and 2022 were $ 1.1 million and $ 0.8 million, respectively, and is presented in unrecognized tax positions on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. In general, it is the practice and intention of the Company to reinvest the earnings of its non-U.S. subsidiaries in those operations. As of June 30, 2023, the Company has not made a current provision for U.S. or additional foreign withholding taxes on investments in foreign 57 subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested. Generally, such amounts become subject to U.S. taxation upon the remittance of dividends and under certain other circumstances. The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal income tax, as well as various other state income taxes and foreign income taxes. The federal income tax returns for the years ended June 30, 2020 through 2022 are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service. For state purposes, the statutes of limitation vary by jurisdiction. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to examination by taxing authorities for years before June 30, 2020. The Company expects the total amount of unrecognized benefits to increase by approximately $ 0.8 million in the next twelve months. The Company records unrecognized tax benefits as liabilities and adjusts these liabilities when its judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. Because of the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the unrecognized tax benefit liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which new information is available. 11. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION The 2015 Incentive Award Plan (“2015 Plan”) provides for the grant of stock options, including incentive stock options, and nonqualified stock options (“NSOs”), restricted stock, dividend equivalents, stock payments, restricted stock units, restricted stock awards (“RSAs”), deferred stock, deferred stock units, performance awards, stock appreciation rights, performance stock units (“PSUs”), and cash awards. As of June 30, 2023 , there were 1,045,380 shares available for issuance under the 2015 Plan. The following table presents the components of share-based compensation expense within continuing operations by award type for the years ended June 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021. 2023 2022 2021 Restricted stock awards $ 2,283 $ 1,684 $ 1,541 Performance stock units 1,373 1,826 1,391 Share-based compensation expense $ 3,656 $ 3,510 $ 2,932 The amount of compensation cost the Company recognizes over the requisite service period is based on the Company’s best estimate of the achievement of the performance conditions and can fluctuate over time. The following table presents the income tax benefit related to share-based compensation expense within continuing operations recognized by award type. 2023 2022 2021 Restricted stock awards $ 530 $ 383 $ 342 Performance stock units 319 416 309 Share-based compensation expense $ 849 $ 799 $ 651 Restricted Stock Awards All RSAs granted to non-employee directors vest over the remainder of that fiscal year, and all RSAs granted to employees vest over a period of between one to three years . Generally, non-vested RSAs are forfeited if employment is terminated prior to vesting. RSAs are granted at a per share fair value equal to the market value of the Company’s common stock on the grant date. The Company recognizes the cost of non-vested RSAs ratably over the requisite service period. The fair value of RSAs vested during the years ended June 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021 was $ 3.2 million, $ 2.4 million, and $ 1.6 million, respectively. A summary of RSA activity within continuing operations for these years is as follows: 58 Number of Restricted Stock Awards Outstanding Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Total Non-vested Restricted Stock Awards at June 30, 2020 106,894 $ 18.01 Granted 93,357 20.34 Vested ( 73,385 ) 18.54 Forfeited ( 8,673 ) 19.29 Total Non-vested Restricted Stock Awards at June 30, 2021 118,193 19.42 Granted 95,753 25.04 Vested ( 99,004 ) 22.01 Forfeited ( 8,534 ) 24.65 Total Non-vested Restricted Stock Awards at June 30, 2022 106,408 21.65 Granted 104,657 23.91 Vested ( 112,789 ) 22.10 Forfeited ( 6,369 ) 21.83 Total Non-vested Restricted Stock Awards at June 30, 2023 91,907 23.66 As of June 30, 2023 , there was $ 1.8 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested RSAs. The Company expects this expense to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.5 years. Performance Stock Units During the years ended June 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021, the Company granted performance shares to certain employees. The awards will be earned based on the Company’s achievement of certain performance criteria over a three-year performance period. The performance period for the awards commences on July 1 of the fiscal year in which they were granted and continues for a three-year period, ending on June 30 of the applicable year. The probability of achieving the performance criteria is assessed quarterly. Following the determination of the Company’s achievement with respect to the performance criteria, the amount of shares awarded will be subject to adjustment based on the application of a total shareholder return (“TSR”) modifier. The grant date fair value is determined based on both the assessment of the probability of the Company’s achieving the performance criteria and an estimate of the expected TSR modifier. The TSR modifier estimate is determined by using a Monte Carlo Simulation model, which considers the likelihood of all possible outcomes of long-term market performance. The amount of compensation cost the Company recognizes over the requisite service period is based on management’s best estimate of the achievement of the performance criteria. The fair value of PSUs vested during the years ended June 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021 was $ 1.7 million, $ 2.1 million, and $ 0.4 million, respectively. A summary of PSU activity within continuing operations for these years is as follows: Number of Performance Stock Units Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Total Non-vested Performance Stock Units at June 30, 2020 67,404 $ 20.02 Granted 123,096 22.11 Vested ( 14,627 ) 26.29 Forfeited ( 15,588 ) 20.25 Total Non-vested Performance Stock Units at June 30, 2021 160,285 21.03 Granted 53,842 28.73 Vested ( 99,860 ) 20.16 Forfeited ( 9,077 ) 26.71 Total Non-vested Performance Stock Units at June 30, 2022 105,190 25.30 Granted 76,567 26.08 Vested ( 56,790 ) 22.38 Forfeited ( 1,996 ) 26.15 Total Non-vested Performance Stock Units at June 30, 2023 122,971 27.12 59 As of June 30, 2023 , there was $ 1.5 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested PSUs. The Company expects this expense to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.9 years. Nonqualified Stock Options In July 2015, the Company granted 137,786 NSOs to certain employees. As of July 2019, all outstanding options were fully vested and exercisable. All outstanding options as of June 30, 2022, were exercised during the year ended June 30, 2023. A summary of NSO activity within continuing operations for these years is as follows: Weighted Weighted Average Average Remaining Aggregate Exercise Contractual Intrinsic Shares Price Term (Yrs.)

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Repurchase Obligations Under certain conditions, the Company is obligated to repurchase new inventory repossessed from dealerships by financial institutions that provide credit to the Company’s dealers. See Note 1 for more information regarding the terms and accounting policies related to this obligation. The Company's obligations under such floor plan agreements are subject to various calculations and caps based on amounts currently owed by dealers to these financial institutions and, based on such terms, totaled approximately $ 53.1 million and $ 46.0 million as of June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022, respectively. We incurred no material impact from repurchase events during the years ended June 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021 . The Company recorded a repurchase liability of $ 1.6 million and $ 0.7 million as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Purchase Commitments The Company is engaged in an exclusive contract with a single vendor to provide engines for its MasterCraft performance sport boats. This contract makes this vendor the only supplier to MasterCraft for in-board engines and expires June 30, 2025 . The Company is obligated to purchase a minimum number of engines for each model year under this contract. The Company could also be required to pay a penalty to this vendor in order to maintain exclusivity if annual purchases under the agreement fail to meet a certain volume threshold. We incurred no penalties related to purchase commitments during the years ended June 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021. Operating Leases The Company has lease agreements for certain personal and real property. Leases with an initial lease term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. Our lease agreements do not include any significant renewal options. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at lease inception. Operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date. Because the rates implicit in the Company's lease contracts are not readily determinable, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of future 60 payments. The incremental borrowing rate is estimated to approximate the interest rate on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments, and in economic environments where the leased asset is located. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any initial direct costs and lease payments made prior to lease commencement and excludes lease incentives incurred. The Company's lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company may enter into lease agreements that contain both lease and non-lease components, which it has elected to account for as a single lease component for all asset classes. The lease-related balances as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, and activity and costs during the periods presented are not material. Legal Proceedings The Company is subject to various litigation, claims and proceedings, which have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The Company accrues for litigation, claims and proceedings when a liability is both probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. As of June 30, 2023 , the Company’s accruals for litigation matters are not material. While these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties, management believes that current litigation, claims and proceedings, individually and in aggregate, and after considering expected insurance reimbursements, are not likely to have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 13. EARNINGS PER SHARE AND COMMON STOCK The factors used in the earnings per share computation are as follows: 2023 2022 2021 Net income from continuing operations $ 90,452 $ 87,945 $ 58,438 Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax ( 21,515 ) ( 29,731 ) ( 2,268 ) Net income $ 68,937 $ 58,214 $ 56,170 Weighted average shares — basic 17,618,797 18,455,226 18,805,464 Dilutive effect of assumed exercises of stock options 5,270 11,110 14,814 Dilutive effect of assumed restricted share awards/units 141,050 170,176 131,243 Weighted average outstanding shares — diluted 17,765,117 18,636,512 18,951,521 Basic net income (loss) per share Continuing operations $ 5.13 $ 4.77 $ 3.11 Discontinued operations ( 1.22 ) ( 1.62 ) ( 0.12 ) Net income $ 3.91 $ 3.15 $ 2.99 Diluted net income (loss) per share Continuing operations $ 5.09 $ 4.72 $ 3.08 Discontinued operations ( 1.21 ) ( 1.60 ) ( 0.12 ) Net income $ 3.88 $ 3.12 $ 2.96 For the years ended June 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021, an immaterial number of shares were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share as the effect would have been anti-dilutive. Stock Repurchase Program On June 24, 2021, the board of directors of the Company authorized a stock repurchase program that allows for the repurchase of up to $ 50.0 million of the Company’s common stock during the three-year period ending June 24, 2024. During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 , the Company repurchased 872,055 shares and 975,161 shares of common stock for $ 22.9 million and $ 25.5 million in cash, including related fees and expenses. We did no t repurchase any common stock during fiscal 2021. As of June 30, 2023 , $ 1.6 million remained available under the current authorization. On July 24, 2023, the board of directors of the Company authorized a new share repurchase program under which the Company may repurchase up to $ 50 million of its outstanding shares of common stock. The new authorization will become effective upon the expiration of the Company's existing $ 50 million share repurchase authorization. 61 14. SEGMENT INFORMATION Reportable Segments Operating segments are identified as components of an enterprise about which discrete financial information is available for evaluation by the CODM in making decisions on how to allocate resources and assess performance. For the year ended June 30, 2023, the Company’s CODM regularly assessed the operating performance of the Company’s boat brands under three operating and reportable segments: Each segment distributes its products through its own independent dealer network. Each segment also has its own management structure which is responsible for the operations of the segment and is directly accountable to the CODM for the operating performance of the segment, which is regularly assessed by the CODM who allocates resources based on that performance. The Company files a consolidated income tax return and does not allocate income taxes and other corporate-level expenses, including interest, to operating segments. All material corporate costs are included in the MasterCraft segment. Selected financial information for the Company’s reportable segments was as follows: For the Year Ended June 30, 2023 MasterCraft Crest Aviara Consolidated Net sales $ 468,656 $ 141,247 $ 52,143 $ 662,046 Operating income (loss) 101,324 20,106 ( 4,515 ) 116,915 Depreciation and amortization 5,555 2,841 2,173 10,569 Purchases of property, plant and equipment 17,414 7,149 5,760 30,323 For the Year Ended June 30, 2022 MasterCraft Crest Aviara Consolidated Net sales $ 466,027 $ 140,859 $ 34,723 $ 641,609 Operating income (loss) 105,341 19,892 ( 9,038 ) 116,195 Depreciation and amortization 4,968 2,665 2,098 9,731 Goodwill impairment — — 1,100 1,100 Purchases of property, plant and equipment 6,642 4,193 1,461 12,296 For the Year Ended June 30, 2021 MasterCraft Crest Aviara Consolidated Net sales $ 350,812 $ 102,688 $ 12,462 $ 465,962 Operating income (loss) 73,354 13,605 ( 8,316 ) 78,643 Depreciation and amortization 4,479 2,503 1,386 8,368 Purchases of property, plant and equipment 5,273 892 19,054 25,219 The following table presents total assets for the Company’s reportable segments as of June 30, 2023, and 2022.

Form 10-K Summary 40 ii CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements contained in this Form 10-K that do not relate to matters of historical fact should be considered forward-looking statements, including but not limited to statements regarding our expected market share, business strategy, dealer network, anticipated financial results, and liquidity. We use words such as “could,” “may,” “might,” “will,” “expect,” “likely,” “believe,” “continue,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” “project,” and other similar expressions to identify some forward-looking statements, but not all forward-looking statements include these words. All of our forward-looking statements involve estimates and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. Accordingly, any such statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the information described under the caption “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Form 10-K. The forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K are based on assumptions that we have made in light of our industry experience and our perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments, and other factors we believe are appropriate under the circumstances. You should understand that these statements are not guarantees of performance or results. They involve risks, uncertainties (many of which are beyond our control), and assumptions. Although we believe that these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, you should be aware that many important factors could affect our actual operating and financial performance and cause our performance to differ materially from the performance anticipated in the forward-looking statements. We believe these important factors include, but are not limited to, those described under “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this Form 10-K and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any of these assumptions prove incorrect, our actual operating and financial performance may vary in material respects from the performance projected in these forward-looking statements. In addition, new important factors that could cause our business not to develop as we expect may emerge from time to time. Further, any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement contained in this Form 10-K to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which it is made or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances. The forward-looking statements contained herein should not be relied upon as representing our views as of any date subsequent to the filing date of this Form 10-K. BASIS OF PRESENTATION Our fiscal year begins on July 1 and ends on June 30 with the interim quarterly reporting periods consisting of thirteen weeks. Therefore, the quarter end will not always coincide with the date of the end of the calendar month. We refer to our fiscal years based on the calendar-year in which they end. Accordingly, references to fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 represent our financial results for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022, June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020, respectively. For ease of reference, we identify our fiscal years in this Form 10-K by reference to the period from July 1 to June 30 of the year in which the fiscal year ends. For example, “fiscal 2022” refers to our fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. MasterCraft Boat Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”), a Delaware corporation, operates primarily through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, MasterCraft Boat Company, LLC, MasterCraft Services, LLC, MasterCraft Parts, Ltd., MasterCraft International Sales Administration, Inc., Aviara Boats, LLC (“Aviara”), Nautic Star, LLC, NS Transport, LLC and Crest Marine, LLC. Unless the context otherwise requires, the Company and its subsidiaries collectively are referred to as the “Company,” “we,” or “us” in this Form 10-K. 1 PART I ITEM 1. BUSINESS We are a leading designer, manufacturer, and marketer of recreational powerboats sold under a diversified portfolio of four brands, MasterCraft, Crest, NauticStar, and Aviara. Through our four brands, we have leading market share positions in three of the fastest growing categories of the powerboat industry, ski/wake boats, outboard saltwater fishing, and pontoon boats, while entering the large, growing luxury day boat segment. As a leader in recreational marine, we strive to deliver the best on-water experience through innovative, high-quality products with a relentless focus on the consumer. Our Segments MasterCraft Segment Our MasterCraft segment consists of our MasterCraft brand, which manufactures premium ski/wake boats. The MasterCraft brand was founded in 1968 and evolved over the next 50-plus years to become the most award-winning ski/wake boat manufacturer in the world. Today, MasterCraft participates in the fastest growing category within the powerboat industry by producing the industry’s premier competitive water ski, wakeboarding, and wake surfing performance boats. We believe the MasterCraft brand is known among boating enthusiasts for high performance, premier quality, and relentless innovation. We believe that the market recognizes MasterCraft as a premier brand in the powerboat industry due to the overall superior value proposition that our boats deliver to consumers. We work tirelessly every day to maintain this iconic brand reputation. Crest Segment Our Crest segment consists of our Crest brand, which manufactures pontoon boats. Crest participates in the second-fastest growing category in the powerboat industry. Crest, which we acquired in October 2018, was founded in 1957 and has grown to be one of the top producers of innovative, high-quality pontoon boats ranging from 20 to 29 feet.

The AV32, AV36, and AV40 began selling in fiscal 2020, fiscal 2021, and fiscal 2022, respectively. In addition, we believe there will be significant model expansion opportunities for Aviara. Our Dealer Network Our products are sold through extensive networks of independent dealers in North America and internationally. We target our distribution to the market category’s highest performing dealers. The majority of our MasterCraft brand dealers are exclusive to our MasterCraft product lines within the ski/wake category, highlighting the commitment of our key dealers to the MasterCraft brand. Our other brands are generally served on a nonexclusive basis by their respective dealers. We consistently review our distribution networks to identify opportunities to expand our geographic footprint and improve our coverage of the market. We constantly monitor the health and strength of our dealers by analyzing each dealer’s retail sales and inventory and have established processes to identify underperforming dealers in order to assist them in improving their performance, to allow us to switch to a more effective dealer, or to direct product to markets with the greatest retail demand. These processes also allow us to better monitor dealer inventory levels and product turns and contribute to a healthier dealer network that is better able to stock and sell our products. We believe our outstanding dealer networks and our proactive approach to dealer management allow us to distribute our products more efficiently than our competitors and will help us capitalize on growth opportunities as our industry volumes continue to increase. For fiscal 2022, the Company’s top ten dealers accounted for approximately 30% of our net sales and none of our dealers individually accounted for more than 10% of our total net sales. North America. In North America, our MasterCraft brand had a total of 112 dealers across 152 locations as of June 30, 2022. Our Crest brand had a total of 132 dealers across 161 locations in North America as of June 30, 2022. Our NauticStar brand had a total of 110 dealers across 119 locations in North America as of June 30, 2022. Our Aviara brand is sold through a distribution network consisting of one dealer with 79 locations as of June 30, 2022. 3 Outside of North America. As of June 30, 202 2 , through our MasterCraft brand, we had a total of 41 international dealers and 41 locations . Our Crest brand had two international dealers in two locations. O ur NauticStar brand had two international dealer s in two location s . Aviara had no international dealer s . We define international dealers as those dealers with locations outside of North America. We are prese nt in Europe, Australia, South America, Africa, Asia, including Hong Kong and the Middle East. We generated 5 .0 %, 4. 5 %, and 4.8 % of our net sales outside of North America in fiscal 202 2 , 202 1 , and 20 20 , respectively. Dealer Relations We have developed a system of financial incentives for our dealers based on achievement of key benchmarks. In addition, we provide our dealers with comprehensive sales training and a complete set of technology-based tools designed to help dealers maximize performance. Our dealer incentive program has been refined through years of experience with some of the key elements including wholesale rebates, retail rebates and promotions, other allowances, and floor plan interest reimbursement or cash discounts to encourage balanced production throughout the year. Beyond our incentive programs, we have developed a proprietary web-based management tool that is used by our dealers on a day-to-day basis to improve their own businesses as well as enhance communication with our factory and sales management teams. Our business-to-business application efficiently executes many critical functions, including warranty registrations, warranty claims, boat ordering and tracking, parts ordering, technical support, and inventory reporting. This system facilitates communication between our sales team and the dealer network and allows our manufacturing department to review consumer demand in real time. Manufacturing MasterCraft boats and trailers are manufactured and lake-tested at our 285,000 square-foot facility located in Vonore, Tennessee. We believe MasterCraft has the only boat manufacturing facility to achieve compliance with all three of the ISO 9001 (Quality Management Systems), 14001 (Environmental Management Systems), and 18001 (International Occupational Health and Safety Management System) standards. Crest boats are manufactured at our 150,000 square-foot facility located in Owosso, Michigan. NauticStar boats are manufactured at our 225,000 square-foot facility located in Amory, Mississippi. Aviara boats are manufactured at our 140,000 square-foot facility in Merritt Island, Florida. The rigorous and consumer-centric attention to detail in the design and manufacturing of our products results in boats of high quality which provides an exceptional on water experience across all of our brands. Our dedication to quality permits our consumers to enjoy our products with confidence. Our boats are built through a continuous flow manufacturing process that encompasses fabrication, assembly, quality management, and testing. We manufacture certain components and subassemblies for our boats, such as upholstery, and procure other components from third-party vendors and install them on the boat. We have several exclusive supplier partnerships for critical purchased components, such as aluminum billet, towers, and engine packages. For MasterCraft, we also build custom trailers that match the exact size and color of our boats. Suppliers We purchase a wide variety of raw materials from our supplier base, including resins, fiberglass, aluminum, lumber and steel, as well as product parts and components such as engines and electronic controls. We maintain long-term contracts with strategic suppliers and informal arrangements with other suppliers. We are focused on working with our supply chain partners to enable cost improvement, world-class quality, and continuous product innovation. We have engaged our key suppliers in collaborative preferred supplier relationships and have developed processes including annual cost reduction targets, regular reliability projects, and extensive product testing requirements to ensure that our suppliers produce at lowest total cost and to the highest levels of quality expected of our brands. These collaborative efforts begin at the design stage, with our key suppliers integrated into design and development planning well in advance of launch, which allows us to control costs and to leverage the expertise of our suppliers in developing product innovations. We believe these collaborative relationships with our most important suppliers have contributed to our significant improvements in product quality, innovation, and profitability. The most significant components used in manufacturing our boats, based on cost, are engine packages. For our MasterCraft brand, Ilmor Engineering, Inc. (“Ilmor”) is our exclusive engine supplier, and for our Crest brand, Mercury Marine (“Mercury”) is our largest engine supplier, while Yamaha Motor Corporation (“Yamaha”) is the largest engine supplier for our NauticStar brand. For our Aviara brand, Mercury provides outboard engines and Ilmor provides sterndrive engines. We maintain strong and long-standing relationships with Ilmor, Mercury, and Yamaha. During fiscal 2022, Ilmor was our largest overall supplier. In addition to ski/wake and sterndrive engines, Ilmor’s affiliates produce engines used in a number of leading racing boats and race cars. We work closely with Ilmor to 4 remain at the forefront of engine design, performance, and manufacturing. W e believe our long-term relationship with our engine supplier partners is a key competitive advantage. We have and continue to see supply chain disruptions that we believe are caused by evolving macroeconomic conditions, including, but not limited to, the dislocation in the labor and logistics markets, as well as upstream supply constraints. However, we have been successful in targeting dual sourcing of some key materials and components to help mitigate risks related to supply constraints. Research and Development, Product Development and Engineering We are strategically and financially committed to innovation, as reflected in our dedicated product development and engineering groups and evidenced by our track record of new product and feature introduction. As of June 30, 2022, our product development and engineering group includes 60 professionals. These individuals bring to our product development efforts significant expertise across core disciplines, including boat design, computer-aided design, naval engineering, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering. They are responsible for execution of all facets of our new product and innovation strategy, starting with design and development of new boat models and innovative features, engineering these designs for manufacturing, and integrating new boats and features into production. Our product development and engineering functions work closely with our Strategic Portfolio Management Team which includes senior leadership from Sales, Marketing and Finance, all working together to develop our long-term product and innovation strategies. We have structured processes to obtain consumer, dealer, and management feedback to guide our long-term product lifecycle and portfolio planning. In addition, extensive testing and coordination with our manufacturing groups are important elements of our product development process, which we believe enable us to leverage the lessons from past launches and minimize the risk associated with the release of new products. We have developed a strategy to launch several new models each year, which will allow us to renew our product portfolio with innovative offerings at a rate that we believe will be difficult for our competitors to match without significant additional capital investments. In addition to our product strategy, we manage a separate innovation development process which allows us to design innovative new features for our boats in a disciplined manner and to launch these innovations in a more rapid time frame and with higher quality. These enhanced processes have reduced the time to market for our new product pipeline. Our research and product development expense for fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020 was $8.2 million, $6.8 million, and $5.2 million, respectively. Intellectual Property We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, and copyright protection, trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, and contractual provisions to protect our rights in our brands, products, and proprietary technology. We also protect our vessel hull designs through vessel hull design registrations. This is an important part of our business and we intend to continue protecting our intellectual property. We currently hold more than 40 U.S. patents and more than 10 foreign patents, including utility and design patents for our transom surf seating, our DockStar handling system, and our SurfStar surf system technology among numerous other innovations. Provided that we comply with all statutory maintenance requirements, our patents are expected to expire between 2028 and 2040. We also have additional patent applications pending in the U.S. and worldwide. We also own in excess of 130 trademark registrations in various countries around the world, most notably for the MasterCraft, Crest, NauticStar, and Aviara names and/or logos, as well as numerous model names in MasterCraft’s Star Series, X, XT, and NXT product families, and we have several pending applications for additional registrations. Such trademarks may endure in perpetuity on a country-by-country basis provided that we comply with all statutory maintenance requirements, including continued use of each trademark in each such country. In addition, we own 38 registered U.S. copyrights. Finally, we have registered more than 35 vessel hull designs with the U.S. Copyright Office, the most recent of which will remain in force through 2027, and have 10 additional vessel hull designs pending. Competitive Conditions and Position We believe each of our brands are highly competitive and have a reputation for quality. We compete by operating, developing, and acquiring a diversified portfolio of leading brands focused on the fastest growing segments of the powerboat industry; focusing relentlessly on delivering the best overall ownership experience to consumers; developing and continuously improving highly efficient production techniques and methods which result in highly innovative products; distributing our products through extensive, consumer-driven independent dealer networks; and attracting, developing, and retaining high-performing employees. Significant competition exists for each of our brands and the markets in which we compete range from being relatively concentrated for the ski/wake category, to being fragmented for the pontoon, and deck and saltwater fishing categories. As of December 2021, based on Statistical Surveys, Inc. (“SSI”) data with all states reporting, the top five brands accounted for approximately 72% of the ski/wake markets, approximately 52% for the pontoon market, and approximately 28% of the deck and saltwater fishing category. Market participants also range from small, single-product businesses to large, diversified companies. In addition, we compete indirectly with businesses that offer alternative leisure products and activities. 5 In recent history, the MasterCraft brand has consistently competed for the leading market share position in the U.S. among manufacturers of premium ski/wake boats based on unit volume. As of December 202 1 , based on SSI data, the MasterCraf t brand has the #1 market share in the ski/wake category with 21. 3 %. As of December 202 1 , based on SSI data, the Crest brand has the # 9 market share in the pontoon category with 4.0 %. As of December 202 1 , based on SSI data, the NauticStar brand has the # 8 market share in the deck and saltwater fishing category with 4. 3 %. As of December 202 1 , based on SSI data, the Aviara brand has the # 7 market share in the 30-foot to 4 3 -foot bowrider category with 5.7 %. Human Capital Resources We have approximately 1,750 employees as of June 30, 2022, of whom 785 work at our MasterCraft facility in Tennessee, 360 work at our Crest facility in Michigan, 375 work at our NauticStar facility in Mississippi, and 230 work at our Aviara facility in Florida. One of our four strategic priorities is developing a high-performing work organization and work environment that is consumer-focused and attracts and retains superior employees. We strive to offer our employees career-specific tools, training, resources, and support development opportunities. We utilize a talent management process, which includes performance appraisal and development planning. We are also deeply invested in attracting and developing the next generation of workforce talent to the boating industry. We’ve partnered with local community and technical colleges by developing training programs and donating boats and supplies to position graduates for jobs in the boating industry upon graduation. Employee safety is always a top priority. We are focused on improving and innovating when it comes to the well-being of our dedicated workforce across our portfolio of brands. We take great care to ensure everyone at the Company is empowered to do their best work, in a safe and well-managed environment. We maintain clean, safe and healthy workplaces through our vigorous training programs and professional safety standards systems, including job hazard assessments and industrial hygiene and ventilation practices. In 2022, we proudly completed a major milestone in workplace safety: over two million safe hours worked without a lost time incident, which continues to accumulate. Achieving two million safe hours worked without a lost time incident showcases the Company’s continuous commitment to safety, an essential element of the Company’s core values in delivering world-class boats. Our compensation program is designed to facilitate high performance and generate results that will create value for our stockholders. We structure executive compensation to pay for performance, reward our executives with equity in the Company in order to align their interests with the interests of our stockholders and allow those employees to share in our stockholders’ success, which we believe creates a performance culture, maintains morale and attracts, motivates and retains top talent. Environmental, Safety, and Regulatory Matters Our operations are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations, including those concerning product safety, environmental protection, and occupational health and safety. We believe that our operations and products are in compliance with these regulatory requirements. Historically, the cost of achieving and maintaining compliance with applicable laws and regulations has not been material. However, we cannot provide assurance that future costs and expenses required for us to comply with such laws and regulations, including any new or modified regulatory requirements, or to address newly discovered environmental conditions, will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, or cash flows. We have not been notified of and are otherwise currently not aware of any contamination at our current or former facilities for which we could be liable under environmental laws or regulations and we currently are not undertaking any remediation or investigation activities in connection with any contamination. However, future spills or accidents or the discovery of currently unknown conditions or non-compliances may give rise to investigation and remediation obligations or related liabilities and damage claims, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, or cash flows. Other Information We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware under the name MCBC Holdings, Inc. on January 28, 2000. In July 2015, we completed an initial public offering of our common stock. Effective November 7, 2018, the name of the Company was changed from MCBC Holdings, Inc. to MasterCraft Boat Holdings, Inc. We maintain a website with the address www.mastercraft.com. We are not including the information contained in our website as part of, or incorporating it by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We make available, free of charge through our website, our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to these reports as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file these materials with, or otherwise furnish them to, the SEC. 6 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS RISK FACTORS Our operations and financial results are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including those described below, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common stock. Risks Relating to Economic and Market Conditions Global economic conditions, particularly in the U.S., significantly affect our industry and business, and economic decline can materially impact our financial results. In times of economic uncertainty or recession, consumers tend to have less discretionary income and to defer significant spending on non-essential items, which may adversely affect our financial performance. Although portions of the marine industry have experienced positive trends as a result of the unique consumer environment resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, these trends may not continue, and the economic uncertainty caused by (i) general economic conditions, (ii) the impact of inflation, (iii) labor shortages, (iv) supply chain disruptions, (v) the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, (vi) the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and (vii) actions and stimulus measures adopted by local, state and federal governments may lead to unfavorable business outcomes. We continue to develop our portfolio of brands, but our business remains cyclical and sensitive to consumer spending on new boats. Deterioration in general economic conditions that in turn diminishes consumer confidence or discretionary income may reduce our sales, or we may decide to lower pricing for our products, which could adversely affect our financial results, including increasing the potential for future impairment charges. Further, our products are recreational, and consumers’ limited discretionary income in times of economic hardship may be diverted to other activities that occupy their time, such as other forms of recreational, religious, cultural, or community activities. We cannot predict the strength of global economies or the timing of economic recovery, either globally or in the specific markets in which we compete. Inflation could adversely affect our financial results. The market prices of certain materials and components used in manufacturing our products, especially resins that are made with hydrocarbon feedstocks, fiberglass, aluminum, lumber, and steel, can be volatile. While, historically, inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations, significant increases in inflation, particularly those related to wages and increases in the cost of raw materials, recently have, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, new boat buyers often finance their purchases. Inflation, along with rising interest rates, could translate into an increased cost of boat ownership. Should inflation and increased interest rates continue to occur, prospective consumers may choose to forego or delay their purchases or buy a less expensive boat in the event credit is not available to finance their boat purchases. Fiscal concerns and policy changes may negatively impact worldwide economic and credit conditions and adversely affect our industry, business, and financial condition. Fiscal policy could have a material adverse impact on worldwide economic conditions, the financial markets, and availability of credit and, consequently, may negatively affect our industry, business, and overall financial condition. Consumers often finance purchases of our products, and as interest rates rise, the cost of financing the purchase also increases. While credit availability is adequate to support demand, interest rates began to rise significantly in the second half of fiscal 2022. If credit conditions worsen and adversely affect the ability of consumers to finance potential purchases at acceptable terms and interest rates, it could result in a decrease in sales or delay improvement in sales. Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly. Borrowings under our revolving credit facility and term loans are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. Reference rates used to determine the applicable interest rates for our debt began to rise significantly in the second half of fiscal 2022. If interest rates continue to increase, the debt service obligations on our indebtedness will continue to increase even if the amount borrowed remains the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease. Please see Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” for discussion of our market risk related to interest rates. In addition, our variable rate indebtedness may use LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the rate. In March 2021, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) publicly announced the transition dates of certain LIBOR settings. Included in that, it was announced that 1-month, 3-month and 6-month U.S. Dollar LIBOR settings will cease to be provided immediately after June 30, 2023. 7 There is no assurance that dates announced by the FCA will not change or that the administrator of LIBOR and/or regulators will not take further action that could impact the availability, composition, or characteristics of LIBOR or the currencies and/or tenors for which LIBOR is published . Uncertainty as to the nature of alternative reference rates and as to potential changes or other reforms to LIBOR may adversely impact the availability and cost of borrowings. An increase in energy costs, including as a result of the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our results of operations can be directly affected, positively and negatively, by volatility in the cost and availability of energy, which is subject to global supply and demand and other factors beyond our control. The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine has impacted global energy markets, particularly in Europe, leading to high volatility and increasing prices for crude oil, natural gas and other energy supplies. Higher energy costs result in increases in operating expenses at our manufacturing facilities, in the expense of shipping raw materials to our facilities, and in the expense of shipping products to our dealers. In addition, increases in energy costs may adversely affect the pricing and availability of petroleum-based raw materials, such as resins and foams that are used in our products. Higher fuel prices may also have an adverse effect on demand for our boats, as they increase the cost of boat ownership and possibly affect product use. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our results. We sell products manufactured in the U.S. into certain international markets in U.S. dollars. The changing relationship of the U.S. dollar to foreign currencies has, from time to time, had a negative impact on our results of operations. Fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to these foreign currencies can adversely affect the price of our products in foreign markets and the costs we incur to import certain components for our products. We will often attempt to offset these higher prices with increased discounts, which can lead to reduced net sales per unit. Risks Relating to Our Business Actual or potential public health emergencies, epidemics, or pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. The impact of actual or potential public health emergencies, epidemics, or pandemics on the Company, our suppliers, dealers, and consumers, and the general economy could be wide-ranging and significant, depending on the nature of the issue, governmental actions taken in response, and the public reaction. The impact of the current COVID-19 pandemic includes illness, quarantines, cancellation of events and travel, business and school shutdowns, reduction in economic activity, widespread unemployment, and supply chain interruptions, which collectively have caused significant disruptions to global economies and financial markets. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, demand for our products increased versus prior periods, but the pandemic could result in future significant volatility in demand, positively or negatively, for our products. Demand volatility may be caused by, among other things: the temporary inability of consumers to purchase our products due to illness, quarantine, or other travel restrictions; dealership closures due to illness or government restrictions; a reduction in boating activity as a result of governmental actions or self-quarantine measures; shifts in demand away from discretionary products; and reduced options for marketing and promotion of products or other restrictions in connection with COVID-19. If such events occurred over a prolonged period, they could increase our costs and difficulty of operating our business, including accurately planning and forecasting for our operations and inventory levels, which may adversely impact our results. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in, and may continue to result in, disruption, uncertainty, and volatility in the global financial and credit markets. Such volatility could impact our access to capital resources and liquidity in the future, including making credit difficult to obtain or only available on less favorable terms. The COVID-19 pandemic may continue to have an impact on our operations, which could be material. For example, many of our facilities have experienced absenteeism caused by illness or quarantine measures. The continuing impact on our business operations could include, but are not limited to, significant numbers of employees contracting COVID-19; facility closures as a result of state and local ""shelter-in-place"" orders, safety precautions, employee illness, or self-quarantine measures; reductions in our operating effectiveness as our employees work from home or as a result of new workplace safety measures; unavailability of key personnel necessary to conduct our business activities; project delays; and supply chain or distribution interruptions and constraints. Additionally, we rely on original equipment manufacturers, dealers, and distributors to market and sell most of our products, and effects on their businesses or financial condition as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic could result in various adverse operational impacts including, but not limited to, lower sales, delayed cash payments, interrupted customer warranty service, and increased credit risk. Our efforts to manage, mitigate, and remedy these impacts may prove unsuccessful as the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control, including the duration and severity of the pandemic, public safety actions taken by government authorities, long-term economic recovery, and resulting consumer response. 8 We may not be able to execute our manufacturing strategy successfully, which could cause the profitability of our products to suffer. Our manufacturing strategy is designed to improve product quality and increase productivity, while reducing costs and increasing flexibility to respond to ongoing changes in the marketplace. To implement this strategy, we must be successful in our continuous improvement efforts, which depend on the involvement of management, production employees, and suppliers. Any inability to achieve these objectives could adversely impact the profitability of our products and our ability to deliver desirable products to our consumers. In addition, we have made strategic capital investments in capacity expansion activities to successfully capture growth opportunities and enhance product offerings, including brand relocation and plant expansions. Moving production to a different plant and expanding capacity at an existing facility involves risks, including difficulties initiating production within the cost and timeframe estimated, supplying product to customers when expected, integrating new products, and attracting sufficient skilled labor to handle additional production demands. If we fail to meet these objectives, it could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand for products and increase the cost of production versus projections, both of which could result in a significant adverse impact on operating and financial results. Additionally, plant expansion can result in manufacturing inefficiencies, additional expenses, including higher wages or severance costs, and cost inefficiencies, which could negatively impact financial results. Adverse weather conditions and climate change events can have a negative effect on revenues. Changes in seasonal weather conditions can have a significant effect on our operating and financial results. Sales of our boats are typically stronger just before and during spring and summer, and favorable weather during these months generally has had a positive effect on consumer demand. Conversely, unseasonably cool weather, excessive rainfall, or drought conditions during these periods can reduce or change the timing of demand. Climate change could have an impact on longer-term natural weather trends, resulting in environmental changes including, but not limited to, increases in severe weather, changing sea levels, changes in sea, land and air temperatures, poor water conditions, or reduced access to water, could disrupt or negatively affect our business. Catastrophic events, including natural and environmental disasters, acts of terrorism, or civil unrest, could have a negative effect on our operations and financial results. We rely on the continuous operation of our manufacturing facilities in Vonore, Tennessee, Merritt Island, Florida, Armory, Mississippi, and Owosso, Michigan for the production of our products. Any natural disaster or other serious disruption to our facilities due to fire, snow, flood, earthquake, pandemics, civil insurrection or social unrest or any other unforeseen circumstance could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, storms, and catastrophic natural or environmental disasters, as well as acts of terrorism or civil unrest, could disrupt our distribution channel, operations, or supply chain and decrease consumer demand. If a catastrophic event takes place in one of our major sales markets, our sales could be diminished. Additionally, if such an event occurs near our business locations, manufacturing facilities or key supplier facilities, business operations, and/or operating systems could be interrupted. We could be uniquely affected by weather-related catastrophic events, as we have dealers and third-party suppliers located in regions of the United States that have been and may be exposed to damaging storms, such as hurricanes and tornados, floods and environmental disasters. Although preventative measures may help to mitigate damage, the damage and disruption resulting from natural and environmental disasters may be significant. Such disasters can disrupt our consumers, dealers, or suppliers, which can interrupt our operational processes and our sales and profits. Our ability to remain competitive depends on successfully introducing new products and services that meet consumer expectations. We believe that our consumers look for and expect quality, innovation, and advanced features when evaluating and making purchasing decisions about products and services in the marketplace. Our ability to remain competitive and meet our growth objectives may be adversely affected by difficulties or delays in product development, such as an inability to develop viable new products, gain market acceptance of new products, generate sufficient capital to fund new product development, or obtain adequate intellectual property protection for new products. To meet ever-changing consumer demands, both timing of market entry and pricing of new products are critical. As a result, we may not be able to introduce new products that are necessary to remain competitive in all markets that we serve. Furthermore, we must continue to meet or exceed consumers' expectations regarding product quality and after-sales service or our operating results could suffer. Our ability to meet demand in a rapidly changing environment may adversely affect our results of operations. The seasonality of retail demand for our products, together with our goal of balancing production throughout the year, requires us to manage our manufacturing and allocate our products to our dealer network to address anticipated retail demand. Production and sales levels throughout fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020 fluctuated due to general economic conditions and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, our dealers must manage seasonal changes in consumer demand and inventory. Our business may experience difficulty in 9 adapting to the rapidly changing production and sales volumes. We may not be able to recruit or maintain sufficient skilled labor or our suppliers may not be able to deliver sufficient quantities of parts and components for us to match production with rapid changes in forecasted demand. In addition, consumers may pursue other recreational activities if dealer pipeline inventories fall too low and it is not convenient to purchase our products, consumers may purchase from competitors, or our fixed costs may grow in response to increased demand. A failure to adjust dealer pipeline inventory levels to meet demand could adversely impact our results of operations. Our financial results may be adversely affected by our third-party suppliers' increased costs or inability to meet required production levels due to increased demand or global supply chain disruptions. We rely on a complex global supply chain of third parties to supply raw materials used in the manufacturing process, including resins, fiberglass, aluminum, lumber and steel, as well as product parts and components. The prices for these raw materials, parts, and components fluctuate depending on market conditions and, in some instances, commodity prices or trade policies, including tariffs. Substantial increases in the prices of raw materials, parts, and components would increase our operating costs, and could reduce our profitability if we are unable to recoup the increased costs through higher product prices or improved operating efficiencies. Similarly, if a critical supplier were to close its operations, cease manufacturing, or otherwise fail to deliver an essential component necessary to our manufacturing operations, that could detrimentally affect our ability to manufacture and sell our products, resulting in an interruption in business operations and/or a loss of sales. In addition, some components used in our manufacturing processes, including engines, boat windshields, towers, and surf tabs are available from a sole supplier or a limited number of suppliers. Operational and financial difficulties that these or other suppliers may face in the future could adversely affect their ability to supply us with the parts and components we need, which could significantly disrupt our operations. It may be difficult to find a replacement supplier for a limited or sole source raw material, part, or component without significant delay or on commercially reasonable terms. In addition, an uncorrected defect or supplier's variation in a raw material, part, or component, either unknown to us or incompatible with our manufacturing process, could jeopardize our ability to manufacture products. Some additional supply chain disruptions that could impact our operations, impair our ability to deliver products to customers, and negatively affect our financial results include: • an outbreak of disease or facility closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic, or similar public health threat; • a deterioration of our relationships with suppliers; • events such as natural disasters, power outages, or labor strikes; • financial or political instability, such as the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, in any of the countries in which our suppliers operate; • financial pressures on our suppliers due to a weakening economy or unfavorable conditions in other end markets; • supplier manufacturing constraints and investment requirements; or • termination or interruption of supply arrangements. These risks are exacerbated in the case of single-source suppliers, and the exclusive supplier of a key component could potentially exert significant bargaining power over price, quality, warranty claims, or other terms. We continue to increase production; consequently, our need for raw materials and supplies continues to increase. Our suppliers must be prepared to ramp-up operations and, in many cases, hire additional workers and/or expand capacity in order to fulfill our orders and those of other customers. Cost increases, defects, or sustained interruptions in the supply of raw materials, parts, or components due to delayed start-up periods our suppliers experience as they increase production efforts create risks to our operations and financial results. The Company has experienced periodic supply shortages and increases in costs to certain materials. We continue to address these issues by identifying alternative suppliers for key materials and components, working to secure adequate inventories of critical supplies, and continually monitoring the capabilities of our supplier base. In the future, however, we may experience shortages, delayed delivery, and/or increased prices for key materials, parts, and supplies that are essential to our manufacturing operations. We have a fixed cost base that will affect our profitability if our sales decrease. The fixed cost levels of operating a powerboat manufacturer can put pressure on profit margins when sales and production decline. Our profitability depends, in part, on our ability to spread fixed costs over a sufficiently large number of products sold and shipped, and if we make a decision to reduce our rate of production, gross or net margins could be negatively affected. Consequently, decreased demand or the need to reduce production can lower our ability to absorb fixed costs and materially impact our financial condition or results of operations. Our business and operations are dependent on the expertise of our key contributors, our successful implementation of succession plans, and our ability to attract and retain management employees and skilled labor. 10 The talents and efforts of our employees, particularly key managers, are vital to our success. We have observed an overall tightening and increasingly competitive labor market, which could inhibit our ability to recruit, train and retain employees we require at efficient costs and could lead to increased costs, such as increased overtime to meet demand and increased wage rates to attract and retain employees. Our management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace. We may be unable to retain them or to attract other highly qualified employees. Failure to hire, develop, and retain highly qualified and diverse employee talent and to develop and implement an adequate succession plan for the management team could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business and our future success. We perform an annual review of management succession plans with our board of directors, including reviewing executive officer and other important positions to substantially mitigate the risk associated with key contributor transitions, but we cannot ensure that all transitions will be implemented successfully. Our ability to continue to execute our growth strategy could potentially be adversely affected by the effectiveness of organizational changes. Any disruption or uncertainty resulting from such changes could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Much of our future success depends on, among other factors, our ability to attract and retain skilled labor, which is critical to our operations. We may experience difficulty maintaining desired staffing levels due to increased competition for employees, higher employee turnover rates and low unemployment rates in many of the geographic areas in which we manufacture or distribute goods. In fiscal 2022, all our facilities increased hiring of skilled hourly labor, and may need to continue to increase hiring of skilled hourly labor to meet increased demand for our products. In the future, if we are not successful in these efforts, we may be unable to meet our operating goals and plans, which may impact our financial results. We continually invest in automation and improve our efficiency, but availability and retention of skilled hourly workers remains critical to our operations. In order to manage this risk, we regularly monitor and make improvements to wages and benefit programs, as well as develop and improve recruiting, training, and safety programs to attract and retain an experienced and skilled workforce. We depend on our network of independent dealers which creates additional risks. Substantially all of our sales are derived from our network of independent dealers. Maintaining a reliable network of dealers is essential to our success. Our agreements with dealers in our networks typically provide for one-year terms, although some agreements have longer terms. The loss of one or more of these dealers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The number of dealers supporting our products and the quality of their marketing and servicing efforts are essential to our ability to generate sales. We face competition from other manufacturers in attracting and retaining independent boat dealers. Although our management believes that the quality of our products in the premium performance sport, outboard boat, and sterndrive boat industries should permit us to maintain our relationships with our dealers and our market share position, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or improve our relationships with our dealers or our market share position. In addition, independent dealers in the powerboat industry have experienced significant consolidation in recent years, which could result in the loss of one or more of our dealers in the future if the surviving entity in any such consolidation purchases similar products from a competitor. A significant deterioration in the number or effectiveness of our dealers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Although at present we believe dealer health to be generally favorable, weakening demand for marine products could hurt our dealers’ financial performance. In particular, reduced cash flow from decreases in sales and tightening credit markets could impair dealers' ability to fund operations. Inability to fund operations can force dealers to cease business, and we may be unable to obtain alternate distribution in the vacated market. An inability to obtain alternate distribution could unfavorably affect our net sales through reduced market presence. If economic conditions deteriorate, we anticipate that dealer failures or voluntary market exits would increase, especially if overall retail demand materially declines. Our dealers require adequate liquidity to finance their operations, including purchasing our products. Dealers are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could unfavorably affect their liquidity positions, including, among other things, continued access to adequate financing sources on a timely basis on reasonable terms. These financing sources are vital to our ability to sell products through our network of dealers. Many of our dealers have floor plan financing arrangements with third-party finance companies. Many factors, including creditworthiness of our dealers and overall aging and level of pipeline inventories, continue to influence the availability and terms of financing that our dealers are able to secure, which could adversely affect sales of our products. We may be required to repurchase inventory of certain dealers. Floor plan financing arrangements with third-party finance companies enable dealers to purchase our products. In connection with these agreements, we may have an obligation to repurchase our products from a finance company under certain circumstances. This obligation is triggered if a dealer defaults on its debt obligations to a finance company. In addition, applicable laws regulating dealer relations may also require us to repurchase our products from our dealers under certain circumstances. In such circumstances, we may not have any control over the timing or amount of any repurchase obligation nor have access to capital on terms acceptable to us to satisfy any repurchase obligation. If we were obligated to repurchase a significant number of units under any repurchase agreement or under applicable dealer laws, our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected. 11 Future declines in marine industry demand could cause an increase in repurchase activity or could require us to incur losses in excess of established reserves. In addition, our cash flow and loss experience could be adversely affected if repurchased inventory is not successfully distributed to other dealers in a timely manner, or if the recovery rate on the resale of the product declines. The finance companies could require changes in repurchase terms that would result in an increase in our contractual obligations. Our industry is characterized by intense competition, which affects our sales and profits. The premium performance sport boat, outboard, and sterndrive boat categories and the powerboat industry as a whole are highly competitive for consumers and dealers. We also compete against consumer demand for used boats. Competition affects our ability to succeed in both the markets we currently serve and new markets that we may enter in the future. Competition is based primarily on brand name, price, product selection, and product performance. We compete with several large manufacturers that may have greater financial, marketing, and other resources than we do and who are represented by dealers in the markets in which we now operate and into which we plan to expand. We also compete with a variety of small, independent manufacturers. We cannot provide assurance that we will not face greater competition from existing large or small manufacturers or that we will be able to compete successfully with new competitors. Our failure to compete effectively with our current and future competitors would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We compete with a variety of other activities for consumers’ scarce leisure time. Our boats are used for recreational and sport purposes, and demand for our boats may be adversely affected by competition from other activities that occupy consumers’ leisure time and by changes in consumer lifestyle, usage pattern, or taste. Similarly, an overall decrease in consumer leisure time may reduce consumers’ willingness to purchase and enjoy our products. Our sales may be adversely impacted by increased consumer preference for used boats or the supply of new boats by competitors in excess of demand. During the economic downturn that commenced in 2008, we observed a shift in consumer demand toward purchasing more used boats, primarily because prices for used boats are typically lower than retail prices for new boats. If this were to occur again, it could have the effect of reducing demand among retail purchasers for our new boats. Also, while we have taken steps designed to balance production volumes for our boats with demand, our competitors could choose to reduce the price of their products, which could have the effect of reducing demand for our new boats. Reduced demand for new boats could lead to reduced sales by us, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Significant product repair and/or replacement due to product warranty claims or product recalls could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. We provide a limited warranty for our products. We may provide additional warranties related to certain promotional programs, as well as warranties in certain geographical markets as determined by local regulations and market conditions. Although we employ quality control procedures, sometimes a product is distributed that needs repair or replacement. Our standard warranties require us or our dealers to repair or replace defective products during such warranty periods at no cost to the consumer. Historically, product recalls have been administered through our dealers and distributors. The repair and replacement costs we could incur in connection with a recall could adversely affect our business. In addition, product recalls could harm our reputation and cause us to lose consumers, particularly if recalls cause consumers to question the safety or reliability of our products. An inability to identify and complete targeted acquisitions could negatively impact financial results. We may in the future explore acquisitions and strategic alliances that will enable us to acquire complementary skills and capabilities, offer new products, expand our consumer base, enter new product categories or geographic markets, and obtain other competitive advantages. We cannot provide assurance, however, that we will identify acquisition candidates or strategic partners that are suitable to our business, obtain financing on satisfactory terms, or complete acquisitions or strategic alliances. In managing our acquisition strategy, we conduct rigorous due diligence, involve various functions, and continually review target acquisitions, all of which we believe mitigates some of our acquisition risks. However, we cannot assure that suitable acquisitions will be identified or consummated or that, if consummated, they will be successful. Acquisitions include a number of risks, including our ability to project and evaluate market demand, realize potential synergies and cost savings, and make accurate accounting estimates, as well as diversion of management attention. Uncertainties exist in assessing the value, risks, profitability, and liabilities associated with certain companies or assets, negotiating acceptable terms, obtaining financing on acceptable terms, and receiving any necessary regulatory approvals. As we continue to grow, in part, through acquisitions, our success depends on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these risks. Our failure to successfully do so could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 12 The inability to successfully integrate acquisitions could negatively impact financial results. Our strategic acquisitions pose risks, such as our ability to project and evaluate market demand; maximize potential synergies and cost savings; make accurate accounting estimates; and achieve anticipated business objectives. Acquisitions we may complete in the future, present these and other integration risks, including: • the possibility that the expected synergies and value creation will not be realized or will not be realized within the expected time period; • the risk that unexpected costs and liabilities will be incurred; • diversion of management attention; and • difficulties retaining employees. If we fail to timely and successfully integrate new businesses into existing operations, we may see higher costs, lost sales, or otherwise diminished earnings and financial results. Our business operations could be negatively impacted by an outage or breach of our information technology systems, network disruptions, or a cybersecurity event. We manage our business operations through a variety of information technology systems and their underlying infrastructure, which we continually enhance to increase efficiency and security. In addition to the disruptions in our information technology systems, cybersecurity threats and sophisticated and targeted cyberattacks pose a risk to our information technology systems. We have established security policies, processes, and defenses, including employee awareness training regarding phishing, malware, and other cyber risks, designed to help identify and protect against intentional and unintentional misappropriation or corruption of our information technology systems and information and disruption of our operations. Additionally, we maintain quarterly discussions with our board of directors to address cyber risks and system and process enhancements. Despite these efforts, our information technology systems may be damaged, disrupted, or shut down due to attacks by unauthorized access, malicious software, computer viruses, undetected intrusion, hardware failures, or other events, and in these circumstances our disaster recovery plans may be ineffective or inadequate. These breaches or intrusions could lead to business interruption, exposure of proprietary or confidential information, data corruption, damage to our reputation, exposure to legal and regulatory proceedings, and other costs. A security breach might also lead to violations of privacy laws, regulations, trade guidelines or practices related to our customers and associates and could result in potential claims from customers, associates, shareholders, or regulatory agencies. Such events could adversely impact our reputation, business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, we could be adversely affected if any of our significant customers or suppliers experiences any similar events that disrupt their business operations or damage their reputation. While we maintain monitoring practices and protections of our information technology to reduce these risks and test our systems on an ongoing basis for potential threats, there can be no assurance that these efforts will prevent a cyber-attack or other security breach. We carry cybersecurity insurance to help mitigate the financial exposure and related notification procedures in the event of intentional intrusion; however, there can be no assurance that our insurance will adequately protect against potential losses that could adversely affect our business. We rely on third parties for computing, storage, processing, and similar services. Any disruption of or interference with our use of these third-party services could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. Many of our business systems reside on third-party outsourced cloud infrastructure providers. We are therefore vulnerable to service interruptions experienced by these providers and could experience interruptions, delays, or outages in service availability in the future due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human, hardware or software errors, hosting disruptions, and capacity constraints. While we have mitigation and service redundancy plans in place, outages and/or capacity constraints could still arise from a number of causes such as technical failures, natural disasters, fraud, or internal or third-party security attacks, which could negatively impact our ability to manufacture and/or operate our business. Our credit facilities contain covenants which may limit our operating flexibility; failure to comply with covenants may result in our lenders restricting or terminating our ability to borrow under such credit facilities. In the past, we have relied on our existing credit facilities to provide us with adequate liquidity to operate our business. The availability of borrowing amounts under our credit facilities is dependent on compliance with the debt covenants set forth in our credit agreement. Violation of those covenants, whether as a result of operating losses or otherwise, could result in our lenders restricting or terminating our borrowing ability under our credit facilities. If our lenders reduce or terminate our access to amounts under our credit 13 facilities, we may not have sufficient capital to fund our working capital and other needs, and we may need to secure additional capital or financing to fund our operations or to repay outstanding debt under our credit facilities. We cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in ensuring the availability of amounts under our credit facilities or in raising additional capital, or that any amount, if raised, will be sufficient to meet our cash needs or will be on terms as favorable as those which have been available to us historically. If we are not able to maintain our ability to borrow under our credit facilities, or to raise additional capital when needed, our business and operations will be materially adversely affected. Risks Relating to Intellectual Property Our success depends on the continued strength of our brands and the value of our brands, and sales of our products could be diminished if we, the athletes who use our products, or the sports and activities in which our products are used are associated with negative publicity. We believe that our brands are a significant contributor to the success of our business and that maintaining and enhancing our brands is important to expanding our consumer and dealer base. Failure to continue to protect our brands may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Negative publicity, including that resulting from severe injuries or death occurring in the sports and activities in which our products are used, could negatively affect our reputation and result in restrictions, recalls, or bans on the use of our products. Further, actions taken by athletes associated with our products that harm the reputations of those athletes could also harm our brand image and adversely affect our financial condition. If the popularity of the sports and activities for which we design, manufacture, and sell products were to decrease as a result of these risks or any negative publicity, sales of our products could decrease, which could have an adverse effect on our net sales, profitability, and operating results. In addition, if we become exposed to additional claims and litigation relating to the use of our products, our reputation may be adversely affected by such claims, whether or not successful, including by generating potential negative publicity about our products, which could adversely impact our business and financial condition. Our intellectual property rights may be inadequate to protect our business. We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, protected design, and trade secret laws; employee and third-party non-disclosure agreements; and other contracts to establish and protect our technology and other intellectual property rights. However, we remain subject to risks, including: • the steps we take to protect our proprietary technology may be inadequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology; • third parties may independently develop similar technology; • agreements containing protections may be breached or terminated; • we may not have adequate remedies for breaches; • pending patent, trademark, and copyright applications may not be approved; • existing patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws may afford limited protection; • a third party could copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology without authorization; or • we may be required to litigate to enforce our intellectual property rights, and we may not be successful. Policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and litigating intellectual property claims may result in substantial cost and divert management’s attention. In addition, we may be required to defend our products against patent or other intellectual property infringement claims or litigation. Besides defense expenses and costs, we may not prevail in such cases, forcing us to seek licenses or royalty arrangements from third parties, which we may not be able to obtain on reasonable terms, or subjecting us to an order or requirement to stop manufacturing, using, selling, or distributing products that included challenged intellectual property, which could harm our business and financial results. If third parties claim that we infringe on their intellectual property rights, our financial condition could be adversely affected. We face the risk of claims that we have infringed third parties’ intellectual property rights. Any claims of patent or other intellectual property infringement, even those without merit, could be expensive and time consuming to defend, cause us to cease making, licensing, or using products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property, require us to redesign, reengineer, or rebrand our products, if feasible, divert management’s attention and resources, or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use a third party’s intellectual property. Any royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. A successful claim of infringement against us could result in our being required to pay significant 14 damages, enter into costly license or royalty agreements, or stop the sale of certain products, any of which could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. While we are not currently involved in any outstanding intellectual property litigation that we believe, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations, we cannot predict the outcome of any pending litigation and an unfavorable outcome could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Risks Relating to Our Regulatory, Accounting, Legal, and Tax Environment International tariffs could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Changes in laws and policies governing foreign trade could adversely affect our business. The institution of global trade tariffs, trade sanctions, new or onerous trade restrictions, embargoes and other stringent government controls carries the risk of negatively affecting global economic conditions, which could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations. Also, certain foreign governments have imposed tariffs on certain U.S. goods and may take additional retaliatory trade actions stemming from the tariffs, which could increase the pricing of our products and result in decreased consumer demand for our products outside of the United States, which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, U.S. initiated tariffs on certain foreign goods, including raw materials, commodities, and products manufactured outside the United States that are used in our manufacturing processes may cause our manufacturing cost to rise, which would have a negative impact on our business and results of operations. An impairment in the carrying value of goodwill, trade names, and other long-lived assets could negatively affect our consolidated results of operations and net worth. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as our trade names, are recorded at fair value at the time of acquisition and are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. In evaluating the potential for impairment of goodwill and trade names, we make assumptions regarding future operating performance, business trends, and market and economic conditions. Such analyses further require us to make certain assumptions about sales, operating margins, growth rates, and discount rates. Uncertainties are inherent in evaluating and applying these factors to the assessment of goodwill and trade name recoverability. We could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill or trade names prior to the annual assessment if we experience business disruptions, unexpected significant declines in operating results, a divestiture of a significant component of our business, or declines in market capitalization. We also continually evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful lives of our definite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets may warrant revision or whether the remaining balance of such assets may not be recoverable. We use an estimate of the related undiscounted cash flow over the remaining life of the asset in measuring whether the asset is recoverable. As of June 30, 2022, the balance of total goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets was $54.5 million, which represents approximately 18 percent of total assets. If the future operating performance of either the Company or individual operating segments is not sufficient, we could be required to record non-cash impairment charges. Impairment charges could substantially affect our reported earnings in the periods such charges are recorded. In addition, impairment charges could indicate a reduction in business value which could limit our ability to obtain adequate financing in the future. Compliance with environmental, health, safety, and other regulatory requirements may increase costs and reduce demand for our products. We are subject to federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations, including those concerning product safety, environmental protection, and occupational health and safety. Some of these laws and regulations require us to obtain permits and limit our ability to discharge hazardous materials into the environment. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in the assessment of fines and penalties, obligations to conduct remedial or corrective actions, or, in extreme circumstances, revocation of our permits or injunctions preventing some or all of our operations. In addition, the components of our boats must meet certain regulatory standards, including stringent air emission standards for boat engines. Failure to meet these standards could result in an inability to sell our boats in key markets, which would adversely affect our business. Moreover, compliance with these regulatory requirements could increase the cost of our products, which in turn, may reduce consumer demand. While we believe that we are in compliance with applicable federal, state, local, and foreign regulatory requirements, and hold all licenses and permits required thereunder, we cannot provide assurance that we will, at all times, be able to continue to comply with applicable regulatory requirements. Compliance with increasingly stringent regulatory and permit requirements may, in the future, 15 cause us to incur substantial capital costs and increase our cost of operations, or may limit our operations, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition. Our manufacturing processes involve the use, handling, storage, and contracting for recycling or disposal of hazardous substances and wastes. The failure to manage or dispose of such hazardous substances and wastes properly could expose us to material liability or fines, including liability for personal injury or property damage due to exposure to hazardous substances, damages to natural resources, or for the investigation and remediation of environmental conditions. Under environmental laws, we may be liable for remediation of contamination at sites where our hazardous wastes have been disposed or at our current or former facilities, regardless of whether such facilities are owned or leased or regardless of whether we were at fault. While we do not believe that we are presently subject to any such liabilities, we cannot assure you that environmental conditions relating to our prior, existing, or future sites or operations or those of predecessor companies will not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition. Additionally, we are subject to laws governing our relationships with employees, including, but not limited to, employment obligations and employee wage, hour, and benefits issues, such as health care benefits. Compliance with these rules and regulations, and compliance with any changes to current regulations, could increase the cost of our operations. We manufacture and sell products that create exposure to potential claims and litigation. Our manufacturing operations and the products we produce could result in product quality, warranty, personal injury, property damage, and other issues, thereby increasing the risk of litigation and potential liability, as well as regulatory fines. We have in the past incurred such liabilities and may in the future be exposed to liability for such claims. We maintain product and general liability insurance of the types and in the amounts that we believe are customary for the industry. However, we may experience material losses in the future, incur significant costs to defend claims or issue product recalls, experience claims in excess of our insurance coverage or that are not covered by insurance, or be subjected to fines or penalties. Our reputation may be adversely affected by such claims, whether or not successful, including potential negative publicity about our products. In addition, if any of our products are, or are alleged to be, defective, we may be required to participate in a recall of that product if the defect or alleged defect relates to safety. These and other claims we may face could be costly to us and require substantial management attention. The nature of our business exposes us to workers’ compensation claims and other workplace liabilities. Certain materials we use require our employees to handle potentially hazardous or toxic substances. While our employees who handle these and other potentially hazardous or toxic materials receive specialized training and wear protective clothing, there is still a risk that they, or others, may be exposed to these substances. Exposure to these substances could result in significant injury to our employees and damage to our property or the property of others, including natural resource damage. Our personnel are also at risk for other workplace- related injuries, including slips and falls. We have in the past been, and may in the future be, subject to fines, penalties, and other liabilities in connection with any such injury or damage. Although we currently maintain what we believe to be suitable and adequate insurance in excess of our self-insured amounts, we may be unable to maintain such insurance on acceptable terms or such insurance may not provide adequate protection against potential liabilities. Increases in income tax rates or changes in income tax laws or enforcement could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. Changes in domestic and international tax legislation could expose us to additional tax liability. Although we monitor changes in tax laws and work to mitigate the impact of proposed changes, such changes may negatively impact our financial results. In addition, increases in individual income tax rates would negatively affect our potential consumers’ discretionary income and could decrease the demand for our products. Risks Relating to Ownership of our Common Stock The timing and amount of our stock repurchases are subject to a number of uncertainties. Our board of directors has authorized the Company’s discretionary repurchase of outstanding common stock, to be systematically completed in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. The amount and timing of share repurchases are based on a variety of factors. Important considerations that could cause us to limit, suspend, or delay future stock repurchases include: • unfavorable market and economic conditions; • the trading price of our common stock; • the nature and magnitude of other investment opportunities available to us from time to time; and • the availability of cash. 16 Delaying, limiting, or suspending our stock repurchase program may negatively affect performance versus earnings per share targets, and ultimately our stock price. Shareholders may be diluted by future issuances of common stock in connection with our incentive plans, acquisitions, or otherwise; future sales of such shares in the public market, or the expectations that such sales may occur, could lower our stock price. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue shares of common stock and options, rights, warrants, and appreciation rights relating to common stock for the consideration and on the terms and conditions established by our board of directors in its sole discretion, whether in connection with acquisitions or otherwise. Any common stock that we issue, including under our 2015 Incentive Award Plan or other equity incentive plans that we may adopt in the future, would dilute the percentage ownership of holders of our common stock. We currently do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock. While we have paid dividends in the past, we currently have no intention to pay dividends on our common stock. Any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. Furthermore, our ability to declare and pay dividends may be limited by instruments governing future outstanding indebtedness we may incur. Certain activist shareholder actions could cause us to incur expense and hinder execution of our strategy. We actively engage in discussions with our shareholders regarding further strengthening our Company and creating long-term shareholder value. This ongoing dialogue can include certain divisive activist tactics, which can take many forms. Some shareholder activism, including potential proxy contests, could result in substantial costs, such as legal fees and expenses, and divert management’s and our board of director’s attention and resources from our businesses and strategic plans. Additionally, public shareholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to our future, adversely affect our relationships with dealers, distributors, or consumers, make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel, and cause our stock price to fluctuate based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business. These risks could adversely affect our business and operating results. 17 ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS. None. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES. As of June 30, 2022, all our MasterCraft boats are manufactured and lake-tested at our 250,000 square-foot manufacturing facility located on approximately 60 acres of lakefront land in Vonore, Tennessee.

These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described in “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and in “Risk Factors” above. Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements. This section generally discusses 2022 and 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021. Discussions of 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020 are not included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and can be found in Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2021 , which was filed with the SEC on September 2, 2021. Key Performance Measures From time to time we use certain key performance measures in evaluating our business and results of operations and we may refer to one or more of these key performance measures in this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” These key performance measures include: • Unit sales volume — We define unit sales volume as the number of our boats sold to our dealers during a period. • Net sales per unit — We define net sales per unit as net sales divided by unit sales volume. • Gross margin — We define gross margin as gross profit divided by net sales, expressed as a percentage. • Net income (loss) margin — We define net income (loss) margin as net income (loss) divided by net sales, expressed as a percentage. • Adjusted EBITDA — We define Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization (“EBITDA”), as further adjusted to eliminate certain non-cash charges and unusual items that we do not consider to be indicative of our core/ongoing operations. For a reconciliation of EBITDA to Adjusted EBITDA, see “Non-GAAP Measures” below. • Adjusted EBITDA margin — We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by net sales, expressed as a percentage. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA margin to net income margin, see “Non-GAAP Measures” below. • Adjusted Net Income — We define Adjusted Net Income as net income (loss) adjusted to eliminate certain non-cash charges and other items that we do not consider to be indicative of our core/ongoing operations and adjusted for the impact to income tax expense (benefit) related to non-GAAP adjustments. For a reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted Net Income, see “Non-GAAP Measures” below. Fiscal 2022 Overview In fiscal 2022, the Company achieved record net sales of $707.9 million, an increase of 34.6 percent from fiscal 2021. Consolidated unit sales volume increased to 8,217 units, up 14.2 percent from the prior year. Gross profit increased to $162.4 million, up 24.9 percent from $130.0 million in fiscal 2021. Despite our increased costs in operating expenses, selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales in fiscal 2022 decreased compared to the prior-year period. Macroeconomic Events We are actively monitoring the impact of changing macroeconomic conditions on our business, including geopolitical events, disrupted global supply chains, and inflation. The impact of these factors has affected many manufacturers across various industries including ours. Supply chain challenges continue to evolve, driven by increased demand, labor shortages, logistical constraints, and rising prices to our suppliers, creating inefficiencies and shipping delays. Rapidly increasing material and overhead costs are outpacing price increases as we try to mitigate the impact. The full extent of the impact on our business, operations, and financial results will depend on evolving factors that we cannot predict. See Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors. 21 NauticStar Impairment Activity and Sale Subsequent to Yearend Despite ongoing efforts to improve operational efficiency and throughput at our NauticStar reporting unit in order to improve sales volumes and yield more favorable margins, including the engagement of third-party consulting resources beginning in the third quarter, the NauticStar reporting unit recorded unplanned negative operating results in the fourth quarter. These results, combined with the outlook for further supply chain disruptions, labor challenges, and higher costs from inflationary pressures, resulted in an impairment trigger in the fourth quarter related to the NauticStar reporting unit’s intangible and other long-lived assets. As a result of our impairment testing, we recognized impairment charges of $23.8 million at our NauticStar segment (see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to impairment charges). Subsequent to fiscal yearend, we sold the NauticStar business. Pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement, substantially all of the assets were sold, and certain liabilities of NauticStar were assumed by the purchaser, including product liability and warranty claims. The resulting loss on sale of the NauticStar business is estimated to be in a range of approximately $20.0 to $23.0 million. The results of the NauticStar business will be presented as discontinued operations in the Company’s fiscal 2023 first quarter. In conjunction with the purchase agreement, the Company entered into a joint employer services agreement and a transition services agreement which provide certain services to the purchaser for various periods of time after the sale. In addition, the Company amended its Credit Agreement and received certain consents and waivers under the Credit Agreement, as amended, related to the sale of the NauticStar business (see Note 13 for more information related to these agreements). 22 Results of Operations We derived the consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 from our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected in the future. Consolidated Results 2022 vs. 2021 2022 2021 Change % Change (Dollar amounts in thousands) Consolidated statements of operations : NET SALES $ 707,862 $ 525,808 $ 182,054 34.6 % COST OF SALES 545,500 395,837 149,663 37.8 % GROSS PROFIT 162,362 129,971 32,391 24.9 % OPERATING EXPENSES: Selling and marketing 14,624 13,021 1,603 12.3 % General and administrative 40,960 37,049 3,911 10.6 % Amortization of other intangible assets 3,988 3,948 40 1.0 % Impairments 24,933 — 24,933 — Total operating expenses 84,505 54,018 30,487 56.4 % OPERATING INCOME 77,857 75,953 1,904 2.5 % OTHER EXPENSE: Interest expense 1,471 3,392 (1,921 ) (56.6 %) Loss on extinguishment of debt — 733 (733 ) (100.0 %) INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAX EXPENSE 76,386 71,828 4,558 6.3 % INCOME TAX EXPENSE 18,172 15,658 2,514 16.1 % NET INCOME $ 58,214 $ 56,170 $ 2,044 3.6 % Additional financial and other data: Unit sales volume: MasterCraft 3,596 3,301 295 8.9 % Crest 3,156 2,467 689 27.9 % NauticStar 1,365 1,387 (22 ) (1.6 %) Aviara 100 42 58 138.1 % Consolidated unit sales volume 8,217 7,197 1,020 14.2 % Net sales: MasterCraft $ 466,027 $ 350,812 $ 115,215 32.8 % Crest 140,859 102,688 38,171 37.2 % NauticStar 66,253 59,846 6,407 10.7 % Aviara 34,723 12,462 22,261 178.6 % Consolidated net sales $ 707,862 $ 525,808 $ 182,054 34.6 % Net sales per unit: MasterCraft $ 130 $ 106 $ 24 22.6 % Crest 45 42 3 7.1 % NauticStar 49 43 6 14.0 % Aviara 347 297 50 16.8 % Consolidated net sales per unit 86 73 13 17.8 % Gross margin 22.9 % 24.7 % (180) bps Net Sales. Net Sales increased 34.6 percent for fiscal 2022 when compared to fiscal 2021 as a result of increased sales volumes, higher prices, favorable model mix, and higher option and content sales. Refer to Segment Results for further details on the drivers of net sales changes. Gross Margin. Gross Margin percentage declined 180 basis points during fiscal 2022 when compared to fiscal 2021. Lower margins were the result of supply chain disruptions, labor challenges, and inflationary pressures that drove material and overhead costs higher, 23 which were most pronounced at the NauticStar segment. Though we implemented mitigating procedures and phased in mid-cycle price increases to offset these headwinds, supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures continued to impact our margins. Operating Expenses. Operating expenses increased 56.4 percent for fiscal 2022 when compared to the same prior-year period. During fiscal 2022, a $1.1 million goodwill impairment charge was recorded in the Aviara segment and $23.8 million was recorded in the NauticStar segment for impairment of other intangible assets and fixed assets, as discussed in Notes 4 and 5 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Additionally, general and administrative expense increased as a result of continued investments in information technology and product development. Moreover, third-party consulting fees were recognized at the NauticStar segment in an effort to improve operational efficiency and increase throughput. Selling and marketing expense increased due to prior-year expenses being impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite our increased costs, selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2022 decreased compared to the prior-year period. Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased $1.9 million driven by lower effective interest rates and lower average outstanding debt balances during fiscal 2022. Loss on Extinguishment of Debt. Loss on extinguishment of debt totaling $0.7 million was recognized upon refinancing the Company’s debt in fiscal 2021. The loss was comprised of unamortized debt issuance costs related to the previously existing credit facility. Income Tax Expense. Our consolidated effective income tax rate increased to 23.8 percent for fiscal 2022 from 21.8 percent for fiscal 2021. See Note 8 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Segment Results MasterCraft Segment The following table sets forth MasterCraft segment results for the fiscal years ended: 2022 vs. 2021 (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2022 2021 Change % Change Net sales $ 466,027 $ 350,812 $ 115,215 32.8 % Operating income 105,341 73,354 31,987 43.6 % Purchases of property, plant and equipment 6,642 5,273 1,369 26.0 % Unit sales volume 3,596 3,301 295 8.9 % Net sales per unit $ 130 $ 106 $ 24 22.6 % Net sales increased 32.8 percent during fiscal 2022, when compared to fiscal 2021. The increase was primarily driven by increased sales volumes, higher prices, favorable model mix, and higher option and content sales. Operating income increased 43.6 percent during fiscal 2022, when compared to the same prior year period. The increase was driven by higher net sales, offset by inflationary pressures and production inefficiencies from supply chain disruptions and labor challenges. Additionally, Selling and marketing expense increased due to prior-year expenses being impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Also, General and administrative expenses increased as a result of continued investments in information technology and product development. 24 Crest Segment The following table sets forth Crest segment results for the fiscal years ended: 2022 vs. 2021 (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2022 2021 Change % Change Net sales $ 140,859 $ 102,688 $ 38,171 37.2 % Operating income 19,892 13,605 6,287 46.2 % Purchases of property, plant and equipment 4,193 892 3,301 370.1 % Unit sales volume 3,156 2,467 689 27.9 % Net sales per unit $ 45 $ 42 $ 3 7.1 % Net sales increased 37.2 percent during fiscal 2022, when compared to fiscal 2021, as a result of higher sales volumes and higher prices. Operating income increased 46.2 percent during fiscal 2022, when compared to the same prior year period, primarily due to higher net sales, offset by inflationary pressures. Purchases of property, plant, and equipment increased $3.3 million during fiscal 2022, when compared to the same prior-year period due to investments in manufacturing capacity expansion and maintenance capital. NauticStar Segment The following table sets forth NauticStar segment results for the fiscal years ended: 2022 vs. 2021 (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2022 2021 Change % Change Net sales $ 66,253 $ 59,846 $ 6,407 10.7 % Operating loss (38,338 ) (2,690 ) (35,648 ) 1325.2 % Impairments 23,833 — 23,833 — Purchases of property, plant and equipment 3,524 2,643 881 33.3 % Unit sales volume 1,365 1,387 (22 ) (1.6 %) Net sales per unit $ 49 $ 43 $ 6 14.0 % Net sales increased 10.7 percent during fiscal 2022, when compared to fiscal 2021. The increase was primarily driven by higher prices, higher option sales, and favorable model mix, partially offset by decreased sales volumes. Operating loss was $38.3 million for fiscal 2022, compared to $2.7 million for fiscal 2021. Benefits from higher sales prices were offset by supply chain disruptions, labor challenges, and higher costs from inflationary pressures. Additionally, $23.8 million was recorded for impairment charges related to other intangible assets and fixed assets, as discussed in Notes 4 and 5 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Moreover, for fiscal 2022, $1.2 million in expense was recognized for third-party consulting fees in an effort to improve operational efficiency and increase throughput at the NauticStar segment. 25 Aviara Segment The following table sets forth Aviara segment results for the fiscal years ended: 2022 vs. 2021 (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2022 2021 Change % Change Net sales $ 34,723 $ 12,462 $ 22,261 178.6 % Operating loss (9,038 ) (8,316 ) (722 ) 8.7 % Impairment 1,100 — 1,100 — Purchases of property, plant and equipment 1,461 19,054 (17,593 ) (92.3 %) Unit sales volume 100 42 58 138.1 % Net sales per unit $ 347 $ 297 $ 50 16.8 % Net sales increased 178.6 percent during fiscal 2022, when compared to fiscal 2021, mainly due to an increase in sales volumes, higher prices, and favorable model mix. Operating loss was $9.0 million for fiscal 2022, compared to $8.3 million for fiscal 2021. Inflation, ramp up related inefficiencies at the Merritt Island facility, including higher overhead costs associated with the new facility, and a goodwill impairment charge recorded during the first quarter of fiscal 2022, offset the benefits from increased net sales. See Note 5 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the impairment charge. 26 Non-GAAP Measures EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin We define EBITDA as earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA further adjusted to eliminate certain non-cash charges or other items that we do not consider to be indicative of our core and/or ongoing operations. For the periods presented herein, these adjustments include impairment charges, share-based compensation, operational improvement initiative costs, Aviara transition costs, debt refinancing charges, Aviara startup costs, and COVID-19 shutdown costs. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA expressed as a percentage of Net sales. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income Per Share We define Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share as net income (loss) adjusted to eliminate certain non-cash charges or other items that we do not consider to be indicative of our core and/or ongoing operations and reflecting income tax expense on adjusted net income before income taxes at our estimated annual effective tax rate. For the periods presented herein, these adjustments include impairment charges, income tax expense (benefit), amortization of acquisition intangibles, share-based compensation, operational improvement initiative costs, Aviara transition costs, debt refinancing charges, Aviara startup costs, and COVID-19 shutdown costs. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted Net Income per share, which we refer to collectively as the Non-GAAP Measures, are not measures of net income (loss) or operating income (loss) as determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. The Non-GAAP Measures are not measures of performance in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss), net income (loss) per share, or operating cash flows determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of cash flow. We believe that the inclusion of the Non-GAAP Measures is appropriate to provide additional information to investors because securities analysts and investors use the Non-GAAP Measures to assess our operating performance across periods on a consistent basis and to evaluate the relative risk of an investment in our securities. We use Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share to facilitate a comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis from period to period that, when viewed in combination with our results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than does U.S. GAAP measures alone. We believe Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share assists our board of directors, management, investors, and other users of the financial statements in comparing our net income (loss) on a consistent basis from period to period because it removes certain non-cash items and other items that we do not consider to be indicative of our core and/or ongoing operations and reflecting income tax expense on adjusted net income before income taxes at our estimated annual effective tax rate. The Non-GAAP Measures have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are: • Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and the Non-GAAP Measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; • The Non-GAAP Measures do not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; • The Non-GAAP Measures do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; • The Non-GAAP Measures do not reflect our tax expense or any cash requirements to pay income taxes; • The Non-GAAP Measures do not reflect interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest payments on our indebtedness; and • The Non-GAAP Measures do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters we do not consider to be indicative of our core and/or ongoing operations, but may nonetheless have a material impact on our results of operations. In addition, because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of the Non-GAAP Measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, including companies in our industry. 27 The following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss) as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, and net income (loss) margin (expressed as a percentage of net sales) to Adjusted EBITDA margin (expressed as a percentage of net sales) for the periods indicated: % of Net % of Net % of Net 2022 sales 2021 sales 2020 sales Net income (loss) $ 58,214 8.2% $ 56,170 10.7% $ (24,047 ) -6.6% Income tax expense (benefit) 18,172 15,658 (7,565 ) Interest expense 1,471 3,392 5,045 Depreciation and amortization 13,614 11,630 10,527 EBITDA 91,471 12.9% 86,850 16.5% (16,040 ) -4.4% Impairments (a) 24,933 — 56,437 Share-based compensation 3,458 2,984 1,061 Operational improvement initiative (b) 1,216 — — Aviara transition costs (c) — 2,150 — Debt refinancing charges (d) — 769 — Aviara start-up costs (e) — — 1,446 COVID-19 shutdown costs (f) — — 1,394 Adjusted EBITDA $ 121,078 17.1% $ 92,753 17.6% $ 44,298 12.2% (a) Represents non-cash charges of $1.1 million recorded in the Aviara segment for impairment of goodwill and $23.8 million recorded in the NauticStar segment for impairment of other intangible assets and fixed assets in fiscal 2022, and non-cash charges recorded in the NauticStar and Crest segments for impairment of goodwill and trade name intangible assets in fiscal 2020.

Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash balance, cash generated from operating activities, our revolving credit agreement and the refinancing and/or new issuance of long-term debt. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $34.2 million as of June 30, 2022, a decrease of $5.1 million from $39.3 million as of June 30, 2021. Total debt as of June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2021 was $56.5 million and $93.1 million, respectively. Our working capital was impacted by the $25.2 million increase in inventory during fiscal 2022 mainly due to an increase in raw materials to support higher production volumes and to increase safety stock to manage supply chain risk. As of June 30, 2022, we have repaid all amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, leaving $100.0 million of available borrowing capacity. As of June 30, 2022, we had $56.5 million outstanding under the Term Loan. Refer to Note 7 — Long Term Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. On June 24, 2021, the board of directors of the Company authorized a stock repurchase program that allows for the repurchase of up to $50.0 million of our common stock during the three-year period ending June 24, 2024. During fiscal 2022, the Company repurchased 975,161 shares of common stock for $25.5 million in cash, including related fees and expenses. As of June 30, 2022, there was $24.5 million of availability remaining under the stock repurchase program. We believe our cash balance, cash from operations, and our ability to borrow, will be sufficient to provide for our liquidity and capital resource needs, including authorized stock repurchases. The following table summarizes the cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities: 2022 2021 2020 Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 73,311 $ 68,538 $ 30,198 Investing activities (15,820 ) (27,832 ) (14,218 ) Financing activities (62,540 ) (17,773 ) (5,487 ) Net change in cash $ (5,049 ) $ 22,933 $ 10,493 Fiscal 2022 Cash Flow Net cash provided by operating activities was $73.3 million, mainly due to net income, partially offset by working capital usage. Working capital is defined as accounts receivable, income tax receivable, inventories, and prepaid expenses and other current assets net of accounts payable, income tax payable, and accrued expenses and other current liabilities as presented in the consolidated balance sheets, excluding the impact of acquisitions and non-cash adjustments. Working capital usage primarily consisted of an increase in inventory, accounts receivable and prepaid expenses and other current assets, partially offset by an increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and accounts payable. As discussed above, inventory increased $25.2 million. Accounts receivable increased due to increased sales. Prepaid and other current assets increased due to higher general insurance premiums. Accrued expenses and other current liabilities increased due to an increase in warranty costs and dealer incentives. Accounts payable increased as a result of increased production levels. Net cash used for investing activities was $15.8 million, which included capital expenditures. Our capital spending was focused on expanding our capacity, maintenance capital, and investments in information technology. Net cash used for financing activities was $62.5 million, which included net payments of $36.7 million on long-term debt and stock repurchases totaling $25.5 million. Fiscal 2021 Cash Flow Net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2021 totaled $68.5 million versus $30.2 million in fiscal 2020. The increase is primarily due to higher net earnings, net of non-cash items, partially offset by changes in working capital that were affected by production ramp-up activities as we experienced an increase in retail demand. Accounts receivable increased $5.9 million primarily due to increased sales across all segments. Inventory increased $28.6 million, driven by increases to support higher production 31 volumes and to increase safety stock to manage supply chain risk. Accounts payable increased $13.4 million primarily due to timing of payments and higher production activities. Accrued expenses and other current liabilities increased $12.2 million primarily driven by incentive -based compensation related to higher net earnings and higher warranty reserves for the increased sales volumes. Net cash used for investing activities was $27.8 million, which primarily included capital expenditures. Our capital spending was focused on expanding our capacity by purchasing the Merritt Island Facility for $14.2 million, capital related to the Aviara transition to the Merritt Island Facility, and maintenance capital. Net cash used for financing activities was $17.8 million and primarily related to net payments of long-term debt. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company did not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements as of June 30, 2022. Contractual Obligations As of June 30, 2022, the Company’s material cash obligations were as follows: Long-Term Debt Obligations — See Note 7 – Long-Term Debt in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Interest on Long-Term Debt Obligations — As of June 30, 2022, the Company has estimated total interest payments on its outstanding long-term debt obligations of $6.6 million, of which $1.8 million is due during the next 12 months. Interest on variable rate debt instruments was calculated using interest rates in effect for our borrowings as of June 30, 2022 and holding them constant for the life of the instrument. Purchase Commitments — As of June 30, 2022, the Company is committed to purchasing $44.8 million of engines, of which $15.7 million is committed during the next 12 months. See Note 10 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Repurchase Obligations — The Company has reserves to cover potential losses associated with repurchase obligations based on historical experience and current facts and circumstances. We incurred no material impact from repurchase events during fiscal 2022, 2021, or 2020. An adverse change in retail sales, however, could require us to repurchase boats repossessed by floor plan financing companies upon an event of default by any of our dealers, subject in some cases to an annual limitation. See Note 10 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. In addition to the above, we have unrecognized tax benefits that are not reflected here because the Company cannot predict when open income tax years will close with completed examinations. See Note 8 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Significant accounting policies are described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. In the application of these policies, certain estimates are made that may have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Actual results could differ from those estimates and cause our reported net income (loss) to vary significantly from period to period. For additional information regarding these policies, see Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Asset Impairment Goodwill The Company reviews goodwill for impairment at its annual impairment testing date, which is June 30, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit may be below its carrying value. As part of the impairment tests, the Company may perform a qualitative, rather than quantitative, assessment to determine whether the fair values of its reporting units are “more likely than not” to be greater than their carrying values. In performing this qualitative analysis, the Company considers various factors, including the effect of market or industry changes and the reporting units' actual results compared to projected results. 32 If the fair value of a reporting unit does not meet the ""more likely than not"" criteria discussed above, the impairment test for goodwill is a quantitative test. This test involves comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, goodwill is not considered impaired. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value then the goodwill is considered impaired and an impairment loss is recognized in an amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of the goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The Company calculates the fair value of its reporting units considering both the income approach and market approach. The income approach calculates the fair value of the reporting unit using a discounted cash flow method. Internally forecasted future cash flows, which the Company believes reasonably approximate market participant assumptions, are discounted using a weighted average cost of capital (“Discount Rate”) developed for each reporting unit. The Discount Rate is developed using market observable inputs, as well as considering whether or not there is a measure of risk related to the specific reporting unit’s forecasted performance. Fair value under the market approach is determined for each reporting unit by applying market multiples for comparable public companies to the reporting unit’s financial results. The key judgements in these calculations are the assumptions used in determining the reporting unit’s forecasted future performance, including revenue growth and operating margins, as well as the perceived risk associated with those forecasts in determining the Discount Rate, along with selecting representative market multiples. As discussed further in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, during the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2020, the Company performed quantitative tests and recognized $1.1 million and $44.4 million in goodwill impairment charges related to its Aviara and its Crest and NauticStar reporting units, respectively. As of June 30, 2022, only the MasterCraft reporting unit has a goodwill balance. The fair value of this reporting unit substantially exceeds its carrying value. Other Intangible Assets The Company's primary intangible assets other than goodwill are dealer networks and trade names acquired in business combinations. These intangible assets are initially valued using a methodology commensurate with the intended use of the asset. The dealer networks were valued using an income approach, which requires an estimate or forecast of the expected future cash flows from the dealer network through the application of the multi-period excess earnings approach. The fair value of trade names is measured using a relief-from-royalty approach, a variation of the income approach, which requires an estimate or forecast of the expected future cash flows. This method assumes the value of the trade name is the discounted cash flows of the amount that would be paid to third parties had the Company not owned the trade name and instead licensed the trade name from another company. The basis for future sales projections for these methods are based on internal revenue forecasts by reporting unit, which the Company believes represent reasonable market participant assumptions. The future cash flows are discounted using an applicable Discount Rate as well as any potential risk premium to reflect the inherent risk of holding a standalone intangible asset. The key judgements in these fair value calculations, as applicable, are: assumptions used in developing internal revenue growth and dealer expense forecasts, assumed dealer attrition rates, the selection of an appropriate royalty rate, as well as the perceived risk associated with those forecasts in determining the Discount Rate. The costs of amortizable intangible assets, including dealer networks, are recognized over their expected useful lives, approximately ten years for the dealer networks, using the straight-line method. Intangible assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment using a process similar to that used to evaluate long-lived assets as described below. Intangible assets not subject to amortization are assessed for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that an asset may be impaired. As part of the annual test, the Company may perform a qualitative, rather than quantitative, assessment to determine whether each trade name intangible asset is “more likely than not” impaired. In performing this qualitative analysis, the Company considers various factors, including macroeconomic events, industry and market events and cost related events. If the “more likely than not” criteria is not met, the impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset. As discussed further in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, during the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2020, the Company performed quantitative tests related to its indefinite-lived intangible assets and, during the year ended June 30, 2022, the Company also performed a recoverability analysis related to its dealer network intangible asset within the NauticStar reporting unit which is subject to amortization. During the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2020, the Company recognized $18.5 million and $12.0 million in intangible asset impairment charges related to its NauticStar and to its Crest and NauticStar reporting units, respectively. Long-Lived Assets The Company assesses the potential for impairment of its long-lived assets if facts and circumstances, such as declines in sales, earnings, or cash flows or adverse changes in the business climate, suggest that they may be impaired. A current expectation that, 33 more likely than not, a long-lived asset (asset group) will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life will also trigger a review for impairment. The Company performs its assessment by comparing the book value of the asset groups to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset group s. If any impairment in the carrying value of its long-lived assets is indicated, the assets would be adjusted to an estimate of fair value. As discussed further in Notes 4 and 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, during the year ended June 30, 2022, the Company recognized $5.3 million in long-lived asset impairment charges related to its NauticStar reporting unit which adjusted the related assets to their estimated fair value. Product Warranties — The Company offers warranties on the sale of certain products for periods of between one and five years from the date of retail sale. These warranties require us or our dealers to repair or replace defective products during the warranty period at no cost to the consumer. We estimate the costs that may be incurred under our basic limited warranty and record as a liability the amount of such costs at the time the product revenue is recognized. The key judgements that affect our estimate for warranty liability include the number of units sold, historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims and cost per claim. We periodically assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as actual claims are determined or as changes in the obligations become reasonably estimable. We also adjust our liability for specific warranty matters when they become known and exposure can be estimated. Future warranty claims may differ from our estimate of the warranty liability, which could lead to changes in the Company’s warranty liability in future periods. Income Taxes— We are subject to income taxes in the United States of America and the United Kingdom. Our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rates, primarily due to changes in non-deductible expenses and the valuation allowance, as further described in Note 8 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, we cannot provide assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest. Revenue Recognition — The Company’s revenue is derived primarily from the sale of boats and trailers, marine parts, and accessories to its independent dealers. The Company recognizes revenue when obligations under the terms of a contract are satisfied and control over promised goods is transferred to a customer. For substantially all sales, this occurs when the product is released to the carrier responsible for transporting it to a customer. The Company typically receives payment from the floor plan financing providers within 5 business days of shipment. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for a product. The Company offers dealer incentives that include wholesale rebates, retail rebates and promotions, floor plan reimbursement or cash discounts, and other allowances that are recorded as reductions of revenues in Net sales in the consolidated statements of operations. The consideration recognized represents the amount specified in a contract with a customer, net of estimated incentives the Company reasonably expects to pay. The estimated liability and reduction in revenue for dealer incentives is recorded at the time of sale. Subsequent adjustments to incentive estimates are possible because actual results may differ from these estimates if conditions dictate the need to enhance or reduce sales promotion and incentive programs or if dealer achievement or other items vary from historical trends. Accrued dealer incentives are included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Rebates and Discounts Dealers earn wholesale rebates based on purchase volume commitments and achievement of certain performance metrics. The Company estimates the amount of wholesale rebates based on historical achievement, forecasted volume, and assumptions regarding dealer behavior. Rebates that apply to boats already in dealer inventory are referred to as retail rebates. The Company estimates the amount of retail rebates based on historical data for specific boat models adjusted for forecasted sales volume, product mix, dealer and consumer behavior, and assumptions concerning market conditions. The Company also utilizes various programs whereby it offers cash discounts or agrees to reimburse its dealers for certain floor plan interest costs incurred by dealers for limited periods of time, generally ranging up to nine months. 34 Other Revenue Recognition Matters Dealers generally have no right to return unsold boats. Occasionally, the Company may accept returns in limited circumstances and at the Company’s discretion under its warranty policy. The Company may be obligated, in the event of default by a dealer, to accept returns of unsold boats under its repurchase commitment to floor plan financing providers, who are able to obtain such boats through foreclosure. The repurchase commitment is on an individual unit basis with a term from the date it is financed by the lending institution through the payment date by the dealer, generally not exceeding 30 months. The Company accounts for these arrangements as guarantees and recognizes a liability based on the estimated fair value of the repurchase obligation. The estimated fair value takes into account our estimate of the loss we will incur upon resale of any repurchases. The Company accrues the estimated fair value of this obligation based on the age of inventory currently under floor plan financing and estimated credit quality of dealers holding the inventory. Inputs used to estimate this fair value include significant unobservable inputs that reflect the Company’s assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use and, therefore, this liability is classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. We incurred no material impact from repurchase events during fiscal 2022, 2021, or 2020. See Note 10 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on repurchase obligations. New Accounting Pronouncements See “Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Significant Accounting Policies — New Accounting Pronouncements.” ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. Market risk represents the risk of changes in the value of market risk sensitive instruments caused by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, interest rates, and commodity prices. Changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in the results of our operations and cash flows. In the ordinary course of business, we are primarily exposed to inflation and interest rate risks. We rely on third parties to supply raw materials used in the manufacturing process, including resins, fiberglass, aluminum, lumber, and steel, as well as product parts and components. The prices for these raw materials, parts, and components fluctuate depending on market conditions and, in some instances, commodity prices or trade policies, including tariffs. Substantial increases in the prices of raw materials, parts, and components would increase our operating costs, and could reduce our profitability if we are unable to recoup the increased costs through higher product prices or improved operating efficiencies. As of June 30, 2022, we had $57.0 million of long-term debt outstanding, bearing interest at the effective interest rate of 2.94%. See Note 7 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding our long-term debt. A hypothetical 1% increase or decrease in interest rates would have resulted in a $0.7 million change to our interest expense for fiscal 2022. ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA. The financial statements and supplementary financial information required to be filed under this Item 8 are presented in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K. ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE. None. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) (of the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. 35 As of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-K Annual Report, we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 202 2 . Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2022. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (""COSO"") in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) . Based on such assessment our management has concluded that, as of June 30, 2022, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2022, has been audited by our independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, as stated in their report which is included in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f), during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION On September 2, 2022, we completed the sale of our NauticStar business to certain affiliates of Iconic Marine Group, LLC (“Purchaser”) pursuant to the terms of an Asset Purchase Agreement, dated September 2, 2022 (the “Purchase Agreement”), by and between Nautic Star, LLC (“Seller”) and Purchaser. Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, Seller sold to Purchaser substantially all of the assets of NauticStar, including, among other things, all of the issued and outstanding membership interests in its wholly-owned subsidiary NS Transport, LLC, all owned real property, equipment, inventory, intellectual property and accounts receivable, and Purchaser assumed certain liabilities of NauticStar, including, among other things, product liability and warranty claims. In connection with the sale, we expect to record a loss on sale between $20.0 million to $23.0 million. ITEM 9C.

LEEMPUTTE Director Peter G. Leemputte September 8, 2022 41 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of MasterCraft Boat Holdings, Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of MasterCraft Boat Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries (the ""Company"") as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the ""financial statements""). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated September 8, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Product Warranties — Refer to Notes 1 and 6 to the financial statements Critical Audit Matter Description The Company offers warranties on the sale of certain of its products for periods of between one and five years. Estimated costs that may be incurred under these warranties are accrued at the time the product revenue is recognized. These estimated costs are based upon the number of units sold, historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims, and the cost per claim. We identified the accrued warranty liability for the MasterCraft brand as a critical audit matter because of the significant judgments made by management to estimate the anticipated rates of warranty claims and cost per claim related to product warranties at the time the product revenue is recognized. This required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s estimates of the rates and costs of future warranty claims. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our audit procedures related to the accrued warranty liability for the MasterCraft brand included the following, among others: 42 • We evaluated the design and operating effectiveness of controls over management’s estimation of the accrued warranty liability, including those over historical product warranty claim data and projected future product warranty claims. • We evaluated the accuracy and completeness of the historical product warranty claims as an input to management’s accrued warranty liability calculation. • We evaluated management’s ability to accurately estimate the accrued warranty liability by comparing the accrued warranty liability in the prior year to the actual product warranty claims paid in the current year. • We evaluated the completeness of the accrued warranty liability through inquiries of operational and executive management regarding knowledge of known product warranty claims or product issues and evaluated whether they were appropriately considered in the determination of the accrued warranty liability. • We assessed management’s methodology and tested the valuation of the accrued warranty liability by developing an independent expectation for the accrual based on historical and current year warranty claims activity and any known trends in warranty claims or specific product issues, and compared our expectation to the amount recorded by management. /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP Nashville, Tennessee September 8, 2022 We have served as the Company's auditor since 2019. 43 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of MasterCraft Boat Holdings, Inc. Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of MasterCraft Boat Holdings Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of June 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended June 30, 2022, of the Company and our report dated September 8, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP Nashville, Tennessee September 8, 2022 44 MASTERCRAFT BOAT HOLDINGS, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unless otherwise noted, dollars in thousands, except per share data and per unit data) 1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation — The accompanying financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of MasterCraft Boat Holdings, Inc. (“Holdings”) and its wholly owned subsidiaries from the dates of their acquisitions. Holdings and its subsidiaries collectively are referred to herein as the “Company.” All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Holdings has no independent operations and no material assets, other than its wholly owned equity interests in its subsidiaries, as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, and no material liabilities. As of June 30, 2022 and 2021, Holdings had no material contingencies, long-term obligations, or guarantees other than a guarantee of its subsidiaries’ long-term debt (see Note 7). Use of Estimates — The preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and related disclosures. The Company bases these estimates on historical results and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable. The Company’s most significant financial statement estimates include impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, warranty liability, unrecognized tax positions, inventory repurchase contingent obligations, and impairment of long-lived assets and intangible assets subject to amortization. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Reclassifications — Certain historical amounts have been reclassified in these notes to the consolidated financial statements to conform to current presentation. Change in Reportable Segments — Beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2022, our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) began to manage our business, allocate resources, and evaluate performance based on the changes that were made in the Company’s management structure in connection with the transition of Aviara production to our Merritt Island, Florida facility. As a result, the Company realigned its reportable segments to MasterCraft, Crest, NauticStar, and Aviara. The Company has recast segment information for all prior periods presented. Refer to Note 12 – Segment Information for further information on the Company’s reportable segments. Revenue Recognition — The Company’s revenue is derived primarily from the sale of boats and trailers, marine parts, and accessories to its independent dealers. The Company recognizes revenue when obligations under the terms of a contract are satisfied and control over promised goods is transferred to a customer. For substantially all sales, this occurs when the product is released to the carrier responsible for transporting it to a customer. The Company typically receives payment from the floor plan financing providers within 5 business days of shipment. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration it expects to receive in exchange for a product. The Company offers dealer incentives that include wholesale rebates, retail rebates and promotions, floor plan reimbursement or cash discounts, and other allowances that are recorded as reductions of revenues in Net sales in the consolidated statements of operations. The consideration recognized represents the amount specified in a contract with a customer, net of estimated incentives the Company reasonably expects to pay. The estimated liability and reduction in revenue for dealer incentives is recorded at the time of sale. Subsequent adjustments to incentive estimates are possible because actual results may differ from these estimates if conditions dictate the need to enhance or reduce sales promotion and incentive programs or if dealer achievement or other items vary from historical trends. Accrued dealer incentives are included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Rebates and Discounts Dealers earn wholesale rebates based on purchase volume commitments and achievement of certain performance metrics. The Company estimates the amount of wholesale rebates based on historical achievement, forecasted volume, and assumptions regarding 49 dealer behavior. Rebates that apply to boats already in dealer inventory are referred to as retail rebates. The Company estimates the amount of retail rebates based on historical data for specific boat models adjusted for forecasted sales volume, product mix, dealer and consumer behavior, and assumptions concerning market conditions. The Company also utilizes various programs whereby it offers cash discounts or agrees to reimburse its dealers for certain floor plan interest costs incurred by dealers for limited periods of time, generally ranging up to nine months . Shipping and Handling Costs Shipping and handling costs includes those costs incurred to transport product to customers and internal handling costs, which relate to activities to prepare goods for shipment . The Company has elected to account for shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a customer as a fulfillment cost. The Company includes shipping and handling costs, including costs billed to customers, in Cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations. Contract Liabilities A contract liability is created when customers prepay for goods prior to the Company transferring control of those goods to the customer. The contract liability is reduced once control of the goods is transferred to the customer. The difference between the opening and closing balances of the Company’s contract liabilities primarily results from the timing difference between the Company’s performance and the point at which it receives pre-payment from the customer. Other Revenue Recognition Matters Dealers generally have no right to return unsold boats. Occasionally, the Company may accept returns in limited circumstances and at the Company’s discretion under its warranty policy. The Company may be obligated, in the event of default by a dealer, to accept returns of unsold boats under its repurchase commitment to floor financing providers, who are able to obtain such boats through foreclosure. The repurchase commitment is on an individual unit basis with a term from the date it is financed by the lending institution through the payment date by the dealer, generally not exceeding 30 months. The Company accounts for these arrangements as guarantees and recognizes a liability based on the estimated fair value of the repurchase obligation. The estimated fair value takes into account our estimate of the loss we will incur upon resale of any repurchases. The Company accrues the estimated fair value of this obligation based on the age of inventory currently under floor plan financing and estimated credit quality of dealers holding the inventory. Inputs used to estimate this fair value include significant unobservable inputs that reflect the Company’s assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use and, therefore, this liability is classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The Company has excluded sales and other taxes assessed by a governmental authority in connection with revenue-producing activities from the determination of the transaction price for all contracts. The Company has not adjusted Net sales for the effects of a significant financing component because the period between the transfer of the promised goods and the customer's payment is expected to be one year or less. Accounts Receivable — Accounts receivable represents amounts billed to customers under credit terms customary in its industry. The Company normally does not charge interest on its accounts receivable . The Company carries its accounts receivable at face value, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts, which the company records on a regular basis based upon known bad debt risks and past loss history, customer payment practices and economic conditions. Actual collection experience may differ from the current estimate of net receivables. A change to the allowance for doubtful accounts may be required if a future event or other change in circumstances results in a change in the estimate of the ultimate collectability of a specific account. Amounts recorded as bad debt expense, write-offs, and recoveries were not material for the years ended June 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020. Cash and Cash Equivalents — The Company considers all highly-liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents. The Company’s cash deposits may at times exceed federally insured amounts. The Company had no cash equivalents at June 30, 2022 and 2021. Concentrations of Credit and Business Risk — Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of trade receivables. Credit risk on trade receivables is mitigated as a result of the Company’s use of trade letters of credit, dealer floor plan financing arrangements, and the geographically diversified nature of the Company’s customer base. Supplier Concentrations The Company is dependent on the ability of its suppliers to provide products on a timely basis and on favorable pricing terms. The loss of certain principal suppliers or a significant reduction in product availability from principal suppliers could have a material adverse effect on the Company. Business risk insurance is in place to mitigate the business risk associated with sole suppliers for sudden disruptions such as those caused by natural disasters. The Company is dependent on third-party equipment manufacturers, distributors, and dealers for certain parts and materials utilized in the manufacturing process. During the years ended June 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, the Company purchased all engines for its MasterCraft performance sport boats under a supply agreement with a single vendor. Total purchases from this vendor were $ 45.0 million, $ 40.6 million, and $ 27.6 million for the years ended June 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. During the years ended June 50 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, the Company purchased outboard engines for its Aviara boats and a majority of the engines for its Crest boats under a supply agreement with a single vendor . Total purchases from this vendor were $ 36.2 million , $ 23.6 million , and $ 15.5 million for the years ended June 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. During the years ended June 30, 202 2 , 202 1 , and 20 20 , the Company purchased a majority of engines for its NauticStar boats under a supply agreement with one vendor. Total purchases from this vendor were $ 21.2 million , $ 14.8 million , and $ 15.2 million for the years ended June 30, 202 2 . 20 2 1 , and 20 20 , respectively . Inventories — Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value and are shown net of an inventory allowance in the consolidated balance sheet. Inventory cost includes material, labor, and manufacturing overhead and is determined based on the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Provisions are made as necessary to reduce inventory amounts to their net realizable value or to provide for obsolete inventory. Property, Plant, and Equipment — Property, plant, and equipment are recorded at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives. Repairs and maintenance are charged to operations as incurred, and expenditures for additions and improvements that increase the asset’s useful life are capitalized. For the years ended June 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, ranges of asset lives used for depreciation purposes are: Buildings and improvements 7 - 40 years Machinery and equipment 3 - 7 years Furniture and fixtures 3 - 7 years Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets — The Company does not amortize goodwill and other purchased intangible assets with indefinite lives, which are primarily related to trade names. The Company’s intangible assets with finite lives consist primarily of dealer networks and are carried at their estimated fair values at the time of acquisition, less accumulated amortization. Amortization is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets (see Note 5). Intangible assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment using a process similar to that used to evaluate long-lived assets described below. The Company has four reporting units, MasterCraft, Crest, NauticStar, and Aviara, which each relate to an operating segment as described in Note 12. As of June 30, 2022, all of the Company’s goodwill relates to the MasterCraft reporting unit and all of the Company’s other intangible assets relate to the MasterCraft and Crest reporting units. Goodwill Goodwill results from the excess of purchase price over the net identifiable assets of businesses acquired. The Company reviews goodwill for impairment annually, at its fiscal year-end annual impairment testing date, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit may be below its carrying value. As part of the impairment tests, the Company may perform a qualitative, rather than quantitative, assessment to determine whether the fair values of its reporting units are “more likely than not” to be greater than their carrying values. In performing this qualitative analysis, the Company considers various factors, including the effect of market or industry changes and the reporting units' actual results compared to projected results. If the fair value of a reporting unit does not meet the ""more likely than not"" criteria discussed above, the impairment test for goodwill is a quantitative test. This test involves comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, goodwill is not considered impaired. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value then the goodwill is considered impaired and an impairment loss is recognized in an amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of the goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The Company calculates the fair value of its reporting units by considering both the income approach and market approach. The income approach calculates the fair value of the reporting unit using a discounted cash flow method. Internally forecasted future cash flows, which the Company believes reasonably approximate market participant assumptions, are discounted using a weighted average cost of capital (“Discount Rate”) developed for each reporting unit. The Discount Rate is developed using observable market inputs, as well as considering whether or not there is a measure of risk related to the specific reporting unit’s forecasted performance. Fair value under the market approach is determined for each unit by applying market multiples for comparable public companies to the unit’s financial results. The key judgements in these calculations are the assumptions used in determining the reporting unit’s forecasted future performance, including revenue growth and operating margins, as well as the perceived risk associated with those forecasts in determining the Discount Rate, along with selecting representative market multiples. The Company recognized $ 1.1 million and $ 44.4 million in goodwill impairment charges during the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2020, respectively (see Note 5). 51 Other Intangible Assets The Company's primary intangible assets other than goodwill are dealer networks and trade names acquired in business combinations. These intangible assets are initially valued using a methodology commensurate with the intended use of the asset. The dealer networks were valued using an income approach, which requires an estimate or forecast of the expected future cash flows from the dealer network through the application of the multi-period excess earnings approach. The fair value of trade names is measured using a relief-from-royalty approach, a variation of the income approach, which requires an estimate or forecast of the expected future cash flows. This method assumes the value of the trade name is the discounted cash flows of the amount that would be paid to third parties had the Company not owned the trade name and instead licensed the trade name from another company. The basis for future sales projections for these methods are internal revenue forecasts by reporting unit, which the Company believes represent reasonable market participant assumptions. The future cash flows are discounted using an applicable Discount Rate as well as any potential risk premium to reflect the inherent risk of holding a standalone intangible asset. The key judgements in these fair value calculations, as applicable, are: assumptions used in developing internal revenue growth and dealer expense forecasts, assumed dealer attrition rates, the selection of an appropriate royalty rate, as well as the perceived risk associated with those forecasts in determining the Discount Rate. The costs of amortizable intangible assets, including dealer networks, are recognized over their expected useful lives, approximately ten years for the dealer networks, using the straight-line method. Intangible assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment using a process similar to that used to evaluate long-lived assets described below. Intangible assets not subject to amortization are assessed for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that an asset may be impaired. As part of the annual test, the Company may perform a qualitative, rather than quantitative, assessment to determine whether each trade name intangible asset is “more likely than not” impaired. In performing this qualitative analysis, the Company considers various factors, including macroeconomic events, industry and market events and cost related events. If the “more likely than not” criteria is not met, the impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset. The Company recognized $ 18.5 million and $ 12.0 million in other intangible asset impairment charges during the years ended June, 30, 2022 and 2020, respectively (see Note 5). Long-Lived Assets Other than Intangible Assets — The Company assesses the potential for impairment of its long-lived assets if facts and circumstances, such as declines in sales, earnings, or cash flows or adverse changes in the business climate, suggest that they may be impaired. A current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived asset (asset group) will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life will also trigger a review for impairment. The Company performs its assessment by comparing the book value of the asset groups to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset groups. If any impairment in the carrying value of its long-lived assets is indicated, the assets would be adjusted to an estimate of fair value. The Company recognized $ 5.3 million in long-lived asset impairment charges during the year ended June 30, 2022, which adjusted the related assets to their estimated fair value (see Notes 4 and 5). Product Warranties — The Company offers warranties on the sale of certain products for periods of between one and five years . These warranties require us or our dealers to repair or replace defective products during the warranty period at no cost to the consumer. We estimate the costs that may be incurred under our basic limited warranty and record as a liability the amount of such costs at the time the product revenue is recognized. Factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of units sold, historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims, and cost per claim. We periodically assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as actual claims are determined or as changes in the obligations become reasonably estimable. We also adjust our liability for specific warranty matters when they become known, and the exposure can be estimated. Future warranty claims may differ from our estimate of the warranty liability, which could lead to changes in the Company’s warranty liability in future periods. 52 Income Taxes — Income tax expense is the total of the current year income tax due or refundable and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Company records its global tax provision based on the respective tax rules and regulations for the jurisdictions in which it operates. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are the expected future tax amounts for the temporary differences between carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities, computed using enacted tax rates. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. Significant judgment is required in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets. The realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income. A tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is “more likely than not” that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the “more likely than not” test, no tax benefit is recorded. The Company recognizes interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. In determining the amount of current and deferred tax the Company takes into account the impact of uncertain tax positions and whether additional taxes, interest and penalties may be due. The Company believes that its accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open tax years based on its assessment of many factors, including interpretations of tax law and prior experience. This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of judgments about future events. New information may become available that causes the Company to change its judgment regarding the adequacy of existing tax liabilities; such changes to tax liabilities will have an impact on tax expense in the period that such a determination is made. Research and Development — Research and development expenditures are expensed as incurred. Research and development expense for the years ended June 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020 was $ 8.2 million, $ 6.8 million, and $ 5.2 million, respectively, and is included in Operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. Self-Insurance — The Company is self-insured for certain losses relating to product liability claims and employee medical claims. The Company has purchased stop-loss coverage in order to limit its exposure to any significant levels for these matters. Losses are accrued based on the Company’s estimates of the aggregate liability for self-insured claims incurred using certain actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and the Company’s historical experience. Deferred Debt Issuance Costs — Certain costs incurred to obtain financing are capitalized and amortized over the term of the related debt using the effective interest method. For the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company incurred deferred financing costs of $ 0.6 million and $ 0.3 million, respectively. For the years ended June 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, the Company recorded related amortization expense of $ 0.2 million, $ 0.6 million, and $ 0.6 million, respectively. Additionally, for the year ended June 30, 2021, the Company recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $ 0.7 million related to the debt refinancing in fiscal 2021. See Note 7 – Long-Term Debt for a discussion on debt issuance costs. Share-Based Compensation — The Company records amounts for all share-based compensation, including grants of restricted stock awards, performance stock units, and nonqualified stock options over the vesting period in the consolidated statements of operations based on their fair values at the date of the grant. Forfeitures of share-based compensation, if any, are recognized as they occur. Share-based compensation costs are included in Selling and marketing and General and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of Operations. See Note 9 – Share-Based Compensation for a description of the Company's accounting for share-based compensation plans. Advertising — Advertising costs are expensed when the advertising first takes place. Advertising expense recognized during the years ended June 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, was $ 5.1 million, $ 4.8 million, and $ 7.0 million, respectively, and is included in Selling and marketing expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. 53 Fair Value Measurements — The Company measures certain of its financial assets and liabilities at fair value and utilizes the established framework for measuring fair value and disclosing information about fair value measurements. Fair value is the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair values: Level 1 — Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity has the ability to access as of the measurement date. Level 2 — Significant other observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. Level 3 — Significant unobservable inputs that reflect a company’s own assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. When measuring fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. When possible, the Company looks to active and observable markets to price identical assets. When identical assets are not traded in active markets, the Company looks to market observable data for similar assets. The Company’s most significant financial asset or liability measured at fair value on a recurring basis is its inventory repurchase contingent obligation (see “Revenue Recognition - Other Revenue Recognition Matters” and Note 10). Non-recurring fair value measurements related to impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets and long-lived assets recorded in fiscal 2020 and 2022 are level 3 measurements. Fair Value of Financial Instruments — The carrying amounts of the Company’s financial instruments, consisting of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and other liabilities, approximate their estimated fair values due to the relative short-term nature of the amounts. The carrying amount of debt approximates fair value due to variable interest rates at customary terms and rates the Company could obtain in current financing. Earnings Per Common Share — Basic earnings per common share reflects reported earnings divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted earnings per common share include the effect of dilutive stock options, restricted stock awards, and performance stock units unless inclusion would not be dilutive. Postretirement Benefits – The Company has a defined contribution plan and makes contributions including matching and discretionary contributions which are based on various percentages of compensation, and in some instances are based on the amount of the employees' contributions to the plans. The expense related to the defined contribution plan was $ 2.0 million, $ 1.7 million, and $ 1.2 million for the years ended June 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Related Party Transactions – In connection with the operations of Crest, the Company made rental payments to Crest Marine Real Estate LLC (“Real Estate”) for a manufacturing facility, storage and office building (the “Crest Facility”). One of the minority owners of Real Estate is a member of the Crest management team. The lease was to expire on September 30, 2028 , and was subject to four consecutive, five-year renewal periods. The lease terms included an option for the Company to purchase the Crest Facility for an amount equal to its fair market value, as determined by appraisals and negotiation between the Company and Real Estate (the “Purchase Option”). The annual rent under the lease was $ 0.3 million for the first five years of the lease term, and was to increase to $ 0.4 million for the remaining five years. Additionally, at the beginning of each of the optional renewal terms the rent was to be adjusted based on the change in the Consumer Price Index. In accordance with the Purchase Option, on October 24, 2019 the Company purchased the Crest Facility for $ 4.1 million. Crest purchases fiberglass component parts from a supplier whose minority owner had been the same member of the Crest management team that had a minority ownership interest in Real Estate. On January 31, 2020 this minority ownership interest was divested and this supplier ceased being a related party. During the period beginning July 1, 2019 and ending January 31, 2020, the Company purchased $ 1.8 million of products from the supplier. New Accounting Pronouncements Issued And Adopted Income Taxes — In December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. ASU 2019-12 simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to general principles in Income Taxes (Topic 740). It also clarifies and amends existing guidance to improve 54 consistent application. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. The adoption of this standard did not have an impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Reference Rate Reform — In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. ASU 2020-04 provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions, subject to meeting certain criteria, that reference London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. An entity may apply ASU 2020-04 as of any date from the beginning of an interim period that includes or is subsequent to March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. The adoption of this standard did not have an impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. 55 2. REVENUE RECOGNITION The following tables present the Company’s net sales by major product category for each reportable segment. Year Ended June 30, 2022 MasterCraft Crest NauticStar Aviara Total Major Product Categories: Boats and trailers $ 450,734 $ 138,841 $ 65,808 $ 34,723 $ 690,106 Parts 13,170 962 428 — 14,560 Other revenue 2,123 1,056 17 — 3,196 Total $ 466,027 $ 140,859 $ 66,253 $ 34,723 $ 707,862 Year Ended June 30, 2021 MasterCraft Crest NauticStar Aviara Total Major Product Categories: Boats and trailers $ 336,785 $ 101,208 $ 59,354 $ 12,462 $ 509,809 Parts 12,934 1,091 477 — 14,502 Other revenue 1,093 389 15 — 1,497 Total $ 350,812 $ 102,688 $ 59,846 $ 12,462 $ 525,808 For Year Ended June 30, 2020 MasterCraft Crest NauticStar Aviara Total Major Product Categories: Boats and trailers $ 226,509 $ 60,888 $ 54,473 $ 9,599 $ 351,469 Parts 9,731 591 448 — 10,770 Other revenue 616 209 9 — 834 Total $ 236,856 $ 61,688 $ 54,930 $ 9,599 $ 363,073 On a consolidated basis, sales outside of North America accounted for 5.0 %, 4.5 %, and 4.8 % of the Company’s net sales for the years ended June 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The Company had no significant concentrations of sales to individual dealers or in countries outside of North America during the years ended June 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020. Contract Liabilities As of June 30, 2022, the Company had $ 1.5 million of contract liabilities associated with customer deposits reported in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet that are expected to be recognized as revenue during the year ended June 30, 2023. As of June 30, 2021, total contract liabilities were $ 1.8 million. During the year ended June 30, 2022, all of this amount was recognized as revenue. See Note 1 for a description of the Company’s significant revenue recognition policies and Note 12 for a description of the Company’s segments. 56 3. INVENTORIES Inventories consisted of the following: As of June 30, 2022 2021 Raw materials and supplies $ 61,045 $ 37,089 Work in process 10,184 10,171 Finished goods 9,708 8,362 Obsolescence reserve ( 2,298 ) ( 2,141 ) Total inventories $ 78,639 $ 53,481 Raw materials and supplies have increased to support higher production volumes and to increase safety stock to manage supply chain risk. 4. PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT Property, plant, and equipment, net consisted of the following: As of June 30, 2022 2021 Land and improvements $ 6,967 $ 5,955 Buildings and improvements 40,836 35,890 Machinery and equipment 39,860 42,526 Furniture and fixtures 3,516 3,126 Construction in progress 6,568 5,737 Total property, plant, and equipment 97,747 93,234 Less accumulated depreciation ( 36,000 ) ( 32,739 ) Property, plant, and equipment — net $ 61,747 $ 60,495 Depreciation expense for the years ended June 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020 was $ 9.6 million, $ 7.7 million, and $ 6.6 million, respectively. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company identified an indication of impairment related to its NauticStar segment’s property, plant, and equipment. After performing a recoverability test, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $ 5.3 million, which adjusted the related assets to their estimated fair value. See Note 5 for further information related to the impairment analysis. 57 5. GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS Goodwill and Other Intangible Asset Impairment See Note 1 for a discussion of the methods used to determine the fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets. In assessing the need for goodwill and intangible impairment, management utilizes a number of estimates, including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, transactions and marketplace data. Accordingly, these fair value measurements fall in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 2020 Impairment Charges In March 2020, the World Health Organization announced that the outbreak of the novel coronavirus had become a worldwide pandemic. The resulting economic environment, including the significant share price and market volatility, as well as disruptions to supply chains resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, triggered an interim impairment analysis for the Company’s intangible assets including goodwill. As a result of this analysis, during the three months ended March 29, 2020, the Company recorded goodwill impairment charges totaling $ 36.2 million and $ 8.2 million and trade name impairment charges totaling $ 7.0 million and $ 5.0 million related to the Crest and NauticStar segments, respectively. 2022 Impairment Charges Aviara Impairment Activity Beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company realigned its reportable segments to MasterCraft, Crest, NauticStar, and Aviara. Refer to Note 12 – Segment Information for further information on the Company’s reportable segments. As a result of the change in segments, in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other, the Company reallocated the goodwill recorded in the MasterCraft reporting unit to the two separate MasterCraft and Aviara reporting units using a relative fair value approach. Prior to realigning our segments, we evaluated our goodwill for impairment and determined no impairment existed as the fair value of our MasterCraft reporting unit, which was the only reporting unit containing goodwill, was in excess of its carrying amount. In conjunction with the reallocation of goodwill, we tested the goodwill at our MasterCraft and Aviara reporting units for impairment using an income-based approach, specifically a discounted cash flow model. The cash flow model included significant judgements and assumptions related to revenue growth and Discount Rates. At the time of the impairment test, near-term operating losses generated by start-up inefficiencies negatively impacted the fair value of Aviara, causing the carrying value of the reporting unit to be in excess of the fair value. Consequently, a $ 1.1 million goodwill impairment charge was recognized in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. NauticStar Impairment Activity Despite ongoing efforts to improve operational efficiency and throughput at our NauticStar reporting unit in order to improve sales volumes and yield more favorable margins, including the engagement of third-party consulting resources beginning in the third quarter, the NauticStar reporting unit recorded unplanned negative operating results in the fourth quarter. These results, combined with the outlook for further supply chain disruptions, labor challenges, and higher costs from inflationary pressures, resulted in an impairment trigger in the fourth quarter related to the NauticStar reporting unit’s intangible and other long-lived assets. In accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other, we evaluated whether the carrying value of the NauticStar reporting unit’s indefinite-lived trade name intangible asset exceeded its fair value. Based on our evaluation of projected future cash flows, we concluded that the trade name intangible asset of $ 8.0 million was fully impaired as of June 30, 2022. In accordance with ASC 360-10, Property, Plant and Equipment – Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets (ASC 360), we then performed a probability-weighted undiscounted cash flow analysis for the asset group related to the NauticStar reporting unit that considered projected cash flows from continuing to operate the assets through their remaining estimated useful lives, a potential sale, and a potential exit of the business other than through a sale and concluded that the carrying value of the asset group was not recoverable. The fair value of the finite-lived dealer network intangible asset was estimated using these cash flows, resulting in a full impairment of $ 10.5 million. The fair value of the fixed assets, which primarily comprised of machinery and equipment, such as tooling, was estimated using liquidation values, resulting in an impairment charge of $ 5.3 million against the asset group’s fixed assets. As a result of our impairment analyses, we recorded total impairment charges of $ 23.8 million related to the NauticStar reporting unit’s intangible and fixed assets. 58 Goodwill Goodwill reallocation and impairment charges for the years ended June 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, along with the carrying amounts of goodwill as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, attributable to each of the Company’s reportable segments, were as follows: MasterCraft Crest NauticStar Aviara Total Goodwill, net at June 30, 2019 $ 29,593 $ 36,238 $ 8,199 $ — $ 74,030 Impairment — ( 36,238 ) ( 8,199 ) — ( 44,437 ) Goodwill, net at June 30, 2020 and 2021 29,593 — — — 29,593 Goodwill reallocation ( 1,100 ) — — 1,100 — Impairment — — — ( 1,100 ) ( 1,100 ) Goodwill, net at June 30, 2022 $ 28,493 $ — $ — $ — $ 28,493 As of June 30, 2022, our annual impairment test date, the Company performed a qualitative assessment and identified no events or circumstances that indicated that there existed a more likely than not probability of impairment of goodwill within our MasterCraft segment. 2022 2021 Gross Amount Accumulated Impairment Losses Total Gross Amount Accumulated Impairment Losses Total MasterCraft $ 28,493 $ - $ 28,493 $ 29,593 $ - $ 29,593 Crest 36,238 ( 36,238 ) — 36,238 ( 36,238 ) — NauticStar 36,199 ( 36,199 ) — 36,199 ( 36,199 ) — Aviara 1,100 ( 1,100 ) — — — — Total $ 102,030 $ ( 73,537 ) $ 28,493 $ 102,030 $ ( 72,437 ) $ 29,593 Other Intangible Assets The following table presents the carrying amount of Other intangible assets, net as of June 30, 2022 and 2021. 2022 2021 Gross Amount Accumulated Amortization / Impairment Other intangible assets, net Gross Amount Accumulated Amortization / Impairment Other intangible assets, net Amortized intangible assets Dealer networks $ 39,500 $ ( 28,143 ) $ 11,357 $ 39,500 $ ( 13,711 ) $ 25,789 Software 245 ( 184 ) 61 245 ( 135 ) 110 39,745 ( 28,327 ) 11,418 39,745 ( 13,846 ) 25,899 Unamortized intangible assets Trade names 49,000 ( 23,000 ) 26,000 49,000 ( 15,000 ) 34,000 Total other intangible assets $ 88,745 $ ( 51,327 ) $ 37,418 $ 88,745 $ ( 28,846 ) $ 59,899 59 As of June 30, 2022, our annual impairment test date, the Company performed a qualitative assessment and identified no events or circumstances that indicated that there existed a more likely than not probability of impairment of other intangible assets within our MasterCraft and Crest segments. See discussion above related to the intangible assets within our NauticStar segment. Amortization expense related to Other intangible assets, net for years ended June 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $ 4.0 million, $ 3.9 million, and $ 3.9 million, respectively. The following table presents estimated future amortization expense for the next five fiscal years and thereafter.

ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES Accrued expenses and other current liabilities consisted of the following: June 30, June 30, 2022 2021 Warranty $ 27,489 $ 22,329 Dealer incentives 15,947 10,634 Compensation and related accruals 5,564 6,046 Contract liabilities 1,472 1,848 Self-insurance 1,171 865 Inventory repurchase contingent obligation 792 471 Other 5,214 4,643 Total accrued expenses and other current liabilities $ 57,649 $ 46,836 Accrued warranty liability activity was as follows: June 30, June 30, 2022 2021 Balance at the beginning of the period $ 22,329 $ 20,004 Provisions 13,970 9,846 Payments made ( 10,797 ) ( 9,116 ) Aggregate changes for preexisting warranties 1,987 1,595 Balance at the end of the period $ 27,489 $ 22,329 7. LONG-TERM DEBT Long-term debt outstanding was as follows: As of June 30, 2022 2021 Revolving credit facility $ — $ 33,728 Term loans 57,000 60,000 Debt issuance costs on term loans ( 451 ) ( 585 ) Total debt 56,549 93,143 Less current portion of long-term debt 3,000 3,000 Less current portion of debt issuance costs on term loans ( 127 ) ( 134 ) Long-term debt, net of current portion $ 53,676 $ 90,277 60 On June 28, 2021, the Company entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of certain financial institutions (the “Credit Agreement”). The Credit Agreement provides the Company with a $ 160.0 million senior secured credit facility, consisting of a $ 60.0 million term loan (the “Term Loan”) and a $ 100.0 million revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”). The Credit Agreement refinanced and replaced the Fourth Amended Credit Agreement, which had been in place prior to the Credit Agreement and provided the Company with a $ 190.0 million senior secured credit facility, consisting of a $ 75.0 million term loan, and $ 80.0 million term loan, and a $ 35.0 million revolving credit facility. The Credit Agreement is secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the Company’s assets. The Credit Agreement contains a number of covenants that, among other things, restrict the Company’s ability to, subject to specified exceptions, incur additional debt; incur additional liens and contingent liabilities; sell or dispose of assets; merge with or acquire other companies; liquidate or dissolve; engage in businesses that are not in a related line of business; make loans, advances or guarantees; pay dividends or make other distributions; engage in transactions with affiliates; and make investments. The Company is also required to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum net leverage ratio. The Credit Agreement bears interest, at the Company’s option, at either the prime rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.25 % to 1.00 % or at an adjusted LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.25 % to 2.00 %, in each case based on the Company’s net leverage ratio. The Company is also required to pay a commitment fee for any unused portion of the revolving credit facility ranging from 0.15 % to 0.30 % based on the Company’s net leverage ratio. As a result of entering into the Credit Agreement, the Company recognized a $ 0.7 million loss on early extinguishment of debt during the year ended June 30, 2021 related to unamortized debt issuance costs of the previously existing credit facility. The Credit Agreement will mature and all remaining amounts outstanding thereunder will be due and payable on June 28, 2026. As of June 30, 2022, the Company was in compliance with its financial covenants under the Credit Agreement. As of June 30, 2022 and 2021, the effective interest rate on borrowings outstanding was 2.94 % and 1.38 %, respectively. On August 31, 2022, the Company entered into the Second Amendment to the Credit Agreement to obtain the necessary consents and waivers to the restrictions described above in the covenants of the Credit Agreement, as related to the sale of the NauticStar business on September 2, 2022, as discussed in Note 13. Revolving Credit Facility In conjunction with the Credit Agreement entered into on June 28, 2021, the Company drew $ 33.7 million on its Revolving Credit Facility. Drawn amounts were used to repay a same amount of outstanding borrowings under the term loans under the Fourth Amended Credit Agreement. As of June 30, 2022, the Company had repaid all outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and had remaining availability of $ 100.0 million. Maturities for the Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility subsequent to June 30, 2022 are as follows: 2023 $ 3,000 2024 4,500 2025 4,500 2026 45,000 Total $ 57,000 61 8. INCOME TAXES Earnings before income taxes by jurisdiction were all in the U.S. except for income of approximately $ 0.1 million during each of the years ended June 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020. For the years ended June 30, the components of the provision for income taxes are as follows: 2022 2021 2020 Current income tax expense: Federal $ 19,620 $ 12,231 $ 2,096 State 5,580 3,057 666 Benefit of operating loss carryforwards ( 638 ) ( 469 ) ( 554 ) Total current tax expense $ 24,562 $ 14,819 $ 2,208 Deferred tax (benefit) expense Federal $ ( 5,351 ) $ 1,471 $ ( 8,887 ) State ( 1,032 ) ( 632 ) ( 886 ) Foreign ( 7 ) — — Total deferred tax (benefit) expense ( 6,390 ) 839 ( 9,773 ) Income tax expense (benefit) $ 18,172 $ 15,658 $ ( 7,565 ) The difference between the statutory and the effective federal tax rate for the periods below is attributable to the following: 2022 2021 2020 Statutory income tax rate 21.00 % 21.00 % 21.00 % State taxes (net of federal income tax benefit and valuation allowance) 2.15 % 1.66 % 1.67 % Uncertain tax positions 2.67 % 0.67 % ( 2.49 %) Change in valuation allowance ( 0.04 %) 0.19 % — Permanent differences ( 0.75 %) ( 0.69 %) ( 0.74 %) Tax credits ( 1.21 %) ( 0.98 %) 4.49 % Other ( 0.03 %) ( 0.05 %) — Effective income tax rate 23.79 % 21.80 % 23.93 % 62 As of June 30, 2022, and 2021, a summary of the significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities was as follows: 2022 2021 Deferred tax assets: Intangible asset basis difference $ 15,886 $ 12,862 Warranty reserves 6,515 5,258 Stock compensation 1,183 761 Unrecognized tax benefits 1,145 665 Inventory 1,142 624 Net operating loss 705 433 Accrued compensation 424 529 Accrued selling 390 368 Repurchase agreements 187 111 Other 332 181 Total deferred tax assets 27,909 21,792 Valuation allowance ( 2 ) ( 177 ) Total deferred tax assets, net of the valuation allowance 27,907 21,615 Deferred tax liabilities: Depreciation ( 5,404 ) ( 5,845 ) Other ( 978 ) ( 640 ) Total deferred tax liabilities ( 6,382 ) ( 6,485 ) Net deferred tax assets $ 21,525 $ 15,130 As of June 30, 2022, the Company has state net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards of $ 15.5 million. Of this amount, $ 3.1 million expire in varying years ranging from June 30, 2025 to June 30, 2036, while the remainder can be carried forward indefinitely. However, the Company determined that it is more likely than not that the benefit from certain state carryforwards will not be realized. In recognition of this risk, the Company has provided a partial valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets relating to these state NOL carryforwards. Unrecognized Tax Benefits A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits, excluding accrued amounts for interest and penalties, is as follows: 2022 2021 Balance at July 1 $ 3,304 $ 2,993 Additions based on tax positions related to the current year 2,004 1,113 Additions for tax positions of prior years 296 77 Reductions for tax positions of prior years ( 91 ) ( 412 ) Settlements of tax positions from prior years — ( 467 ) Balance at June 30 $ 5,513 $ 3,304 Of this total, $ 4.7 million and $ 2.7 million as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, represent the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably affect the effective income tax rate in future periods. The total amount of interest and penalties recorded in the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended June 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020 was an expense of $ 0.2 million, a benefit of $ 0.2 million, and an expense of $ 0.3 million, respectively. The amounts accrued for interest and penalties at June 30, 2022 and 2021 were $ 0.8 million and $ 0.5 million, respectively, and is presented in unrecognized tax positions on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. In general, it is the practice and intention of the Company to reinvest the earnings of its non-U.S. subsidiaries in those operations. As of June 30, 2022, the Company has not made a current provision for U.S. or additional foreign withholding taxes on investments in foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested. Generally, such amounts become subject to U.S. taxation upon the remittance of dividends and under certain other circumstances. The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal income tax, as well as various other state income taxes and foreign income taxes. The federal income tax returns for the years ended June 30, 2019 through 2021 are subject to examination by the 63 Internal Revenue Service. For state purposes, the statutes of limitation vary by jurisdiction. With few exceptions, t he Company is no longer subject to examination by taxing authorities for years before June 30, 201 9 . The Company expects the total amount of unrecognized benefits to increase by approximately $ 0.4 million in the next twelve months. The Company records unrecognized tax benefits as liabilities and adjust s these liabilities when its judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. Because of the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the unrecognized tax benefit liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which new information is available. 9. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION The 2015 Incentive Award Plan (“2015 Plan”) provides for the grant of stock options, including incentive stock options, and nonqualified stock options (“NSOs”), restricted stock, dividend equivalents, stock payments, restricted stock units, restricted stock awards (“RSAs”), deferred stock, deferred stock units, performance awards, stock appreciation rights, performance stock units (“PSUs”), and cash awards. As of June 30, 2022, there were 1,186,591 shares available for issuance under the 2015 Plan. The following table presents the components of share-based compensation expense by award type for the years ended June 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020. 2022 2021 2020 Restricted stock awards $ 1,630 $ 1,545 $ 1,285 Performance stock units 1,828 1,439 ( 233 ) Stock options — — 9 Share-based compensation expense $ 3,458 $ 2,984 $ 1,061 The amount of compensation cost the Company recognizes over the requisite service period is based on the Company’s best estimate of the achievement of the performance conditions and can fluctuate over time. Adjustment to Share-Based Compensation In conjunction with the resignation of an executive officer in October 2019, approximately $ 0.5 million of share-based compensation expense recognized in prior periods was reversed during fiscal 2020 for RSAs and PSUs that were forfeited. The following table presents the income tax benefit related to share-based compensation expense recognized by award type. 2022 2021 2020 Restricted stock awards $ 377 $ 350 $ 290 Performance stock units 423 326 ( 53 ) Stock options — — 2 Share-based compensation expense $ 800 $ 676 $ 239 Restricted Stock Awards All RSAs granted to non-employee directors vest over the remainder of that fiscal year, and all RSAs granted to employees vest over a period of between one to three years . Generally, non-vested RSAs are forfeited if employment is terminated prior to vesting. RSAs are granted at a per share fair value equal to the market value of the Company’s common stock on the grant date. The Company recognizes the cost of non-vested RSAs ratably over the requisite service period. The fair value of RSAs vested during the years ended June 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020 was $ 2.4 million, $ 1.6 million, and $ 1.0 million, respectively. 64 A summary of RSA activity for the years ended June 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, is as follows: Number of Restricted Stock Awards Outstanding Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Total Non-vested Restricted Stock Awards at June 30, 2019 53,804 $ 22.94 Granted 138,457 17.41 Vested ( 50,570 ) 20.09 Forfeited ( 34,797 ) 20.24 Total Non-vested Restricted Stock Awards at June 30, 2020 106,894 18.01 Granted 93,357 20.34 Vested ( 73,385 ) 18.54 Forfeited ( 8,673 ) 19.29 Total Non-vested Restricted Stock Awards at June 30, 2021 118,193 19.42 Granted 95,753 25.04 Vested ( 99,004 ) 22.01 Forfeited ( 8,534 ) 24.65 Total Non-vested Restricted Stock Awards at June 30, 2022 106,408 21.65 As of June 30, 2022, there was $ 1.7 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested RSAs. The Company expects this expense to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.5 years. Performance Stock Units During the years ended June 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, the Company granted performance shares to certain employees. The awards will be earned based on the Company’s achievement of certain performance criteria over a three-year performance period. The performance period for the awards commence on July 1 of the fiscal year in which they were granted and continue for a three-year period, ending on June 30 of the applicable year. The probability of achieving the performance criteria is assessed quarterly. Following the determination of the Company’s achievement with respect to the performance criteria, the amount of shares awarded will be subject to adjustment based on the application of a total shareholder return (“TSR”) modifier. The grant date fair value is determined based on both the assessment of the probability of the Company’s achieving the performance criteria and an estimate of the expected TSR modifier. The TSR modifier estimate is determined by using a Monte Carlo Simulation model, which considers the likelihood of all possible outcomes of long-term market performance. The amount of compensation cost the Company recognizes over the requisite service period is based on management’s best estimate of the achievement of the performance criteria. The fair value of PSUs vested during the years ended June 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020 was $ 2.1 million, $ 0.4 million, and $ 0.2 million, respectively. A summary of PSU activity for the years ended June 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, is as follows: Number of Performance Stock Units Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Total Non-vested Performance Stock Units at June 30, 2019 50,621 $ 23.34 Granted 72,048 18.18 Vested ( 8,383 ) 19.40 Forfeited ( 46,882 ) 20.82 Total Non-vested Performance Stock Units at June 30, 2020 67,404 20.02 Granted 123,096 22.11 Vested ( 14,627 ) 26.29 Forfeited ( 15,588 ) 20.25 Total Non-vested Performance Stock Units at June 30, 2021 160,285 21.03 Granted 53,842 28.73 Vested ( 99,860 ) 20.16 Forfeited ( 9,077 ) 26.71 Total Non-vested Performance Stock Units at June 30, 2022 105,190 25.30 65 As of June 30, 2022, there was $ 1.8 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested PSUs. The Company expects this expense to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.5 years. Nonqualified Stock Options In July 2015, the Company granted 137,786 NSOs to certain employees. As of July 2019, all outstanding options were fully vested and exercisable. The fair value of NSOs vested during the year ended June 30, 2020 was $ 0.2 million. A summary of NSO activity for the years ended June 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020 is as follows: Weighted Weighted Average Average Remaining Aggregate Exercise Contractual Intrinsic Shares Price Term (Yrs.) Value Outstanding at June 30, 2019 80,859 $ 10.70 6.1 $ 719 Granted — Exercised ( 48,467 ) 10.70 Forfeited or expired — Outstanding at June 30, 2020 32,392 10.70 5.1 270 Granted — Exercised ( 7,952 ) 10.70 Forfeited or expired — Outstanding at June 30, 2021 24,440 10.70 4.1 381 Granted — Exercised ( 9,294 ) 10.70 Forfeited or expired — Outstanding at June 30, 2022 15,146 10.70 3.1 157 66 10. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Repurchase Obligations Under certain conditions, the Company is obligated to repurchase new inventory repossessed from dealerships by financial institutions that provide credit to the Company’s dealers. See Note 1 for more information regarding the terms and accounting policies related to this obligation. The maximum obligation of the Company under such floor plan agreements totaled approximately $ 97.3 million and $ 67.0 million as of June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2021, respectively. We incurred no material impact from repurchase events during the years ended June 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020. The Company recorded a repurchase liability of $ 0.8 million and $ 0.5 million as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Purchase Commitments The Company is engaged in an exclusive contract with a single vendor to provide engines for its MasterCraft performance sport boats. This contract makes this vendor the only supplier to MasterCraft for in-board engines and expires June 30, 2025. The Company is obligated to purchase a minimum number of engines for each model year under this contract. The Company could also be required to pay a penalty to this vendor in order to maintain exclusivity if annual purchases under the agreement fail to meet a certain volume threshold. We incurred no penalties related to purchase commitments during the years ended June 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020. In October 2021, the Company entered into a new supplier agreement to purchase marine outboard engines for its Crest pontoon boats. During the term of the agreement, which expires July 2, 2022 , the Company is obligated to purchase a minimum annual gross dollar value in engines. As of June 30, 2022, the obligation under the agreement had been satisfied. Operating Leases The Company has lease agreements for certain personal and real property. Leases with an initial lease term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. Our lease agreements do not include any significant renewal options. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at lease inception. Operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date. Because the rates implicit in the Company's lease contracts are not readily determinable, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of future payments. The incremental borrowing rate is estimated to approximate the interest rate on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments, and in economic environments where the leased asset is located. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any initial direct costs and lease payments made prior to lease commencement and excludes lease incentives incurred. The Company's lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company may enter into lease agreements that contain both lease and non-lease components, which it has elected to account for as a single lease component for all asset classes. The lease-related balances as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, and activity and costs during the periods presented are not material. Legal Proceedings The Company is subject to various litigation, claims and proceedings, which have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The Company accrues for litigation, claims and proceedings when a liability is both probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. As of June 30, 2022, the Company’s accruals for litigation matters are not material. While these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties, management believes that current litigation, claims and proceedings, individually and in aggregate, and after considering expected insurance reimbursements, are not likely to have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 67 11. EARNINGS PER SHARE AND COMMON STOCK The factors used in the earnings per share computation are as follows: 2022 2021 2020 Net income (loss) $ 58,214 $ 56,170 $ ( 24,047 ) Weighted average shares — basic 18,455,226 18,805,464 18,734,482 Dilutive effect of assumed exercises of stock options 11,110 14,814 — Dilutive effect of assumed restricted share awards/units 170,176 131,243 — Weighted average outstanding shares — diluted 18,636,512 18,951,521 18,734,482 Basic net income (loss) per share $ 3.15 $ 2.99 $ ( 1.28 ) Diluted net income (loss) per share $ 3.12 $ 2.96 $ ( 1.28 ) For the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, an immaterial number of shares were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share as the effect would have been anti-dilutive. For the year ended June 30, 2020, the dilutive effect of approximately 45,000 outstanding RSAs, PSUs and NSOs have been excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share as the effect would have been anti-dilutive because of the net loss for the year ended June 30, 2020. Stock Repurchase Program On June 24, 2021, the board of directors of the Company authorized a stock repurchase program that allows for the repurchase of up to $ 50.0 million of the Company’s common stock during the three-year period ending June 24, 2024. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, the Company repurchased 975,161 shares of common stock for $ 25.5 million in cash, including related fees and expenses. We did not repurchase any common stock during fiscal 2021. As of June 30, 2022, $ 24.5 million remained available under the current authorization. 12. SEGMENT INFORMATION Change in Reportable Segments Beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2022 and as discussed in Note 1, our CODM began to manage our business, allocate resources, and evaluate performance based on the reportable segments of MasterCraft, Crest, NauticStar, and Aviara. Reportable Segments Operating segments are identified as components of an enterprise about which discrete financial information is available for evaluation by the CODM in making decisions on how to allocate resources and assess performance. For the year ended June 30, 2022, the Company’s CODM regularly assessed the operating performance of the Company’s boat brands under four operating and reportable segments: • The MasterCraft segment produces boats at its Vonore, Tennessee facility. These are premium recreational performance sport boats primarily used for water skiing, wakeboarding, wake surfing, and general recreational boating. • The Crest segment produces pontoon boats at its Owosso, Michigan facility. Crest’s boats are primarily used for general recreational boating. • The NauticStar segment produces boats at its Amory, Mississippi facility. NauticStar’s boats are primarily used for saltwater fishing and general recreational boating. • The Aviara segment produces luxury day boats at its Merritt Island, Florida facility. Aviara boats are primarily used for general recreational boating. Beginning in fiscal 2022, the CODM began to assess Aviara’s performance on a stand-alone basis using criteria consistent with our other operating and reportable segments. Each segment distributes its products through its own independent dealer network. Each segment also has its own management structure which is responsible for the operations of the segment and is directly accountable to the CODM for the operating performance of the segment, which is regularly assessed by the CODM who allocates resources based on that performance. 68 The Company files a consolidated income tax return and does not allocate income taxes and other corporate-level expenses, including interest, to operating segments. All material corporate costs are included in the MasterCraft segment. Selected financial information for the Company’s reportable segments was as follows: For the Year Ended June 30, 2022 MasterCraft Crest NauticStar Aviara Consolidated Net sales $ 466,027 $ 140,859 $ 66,253 $ 34,723 $ 707,862 Operating income (loss) 105,341 19,892 ( 38,338 ) ( 9,038 ) 77,857 Depreciation and amortization 4,968 2,665 3,883 2,098 13,614 Impairments — — 23,833 1,100 24,933 Purchases of property, plant and equipment 6,642 4,193 3,524 1,461 15,820 For the Year Ended June 30, 2021 MasterCraft Crest NauticStar Aviara Consolidated Net sales $ 350,812 $ 102,688 $ 59,846 $ 12,462 $ 525,808 Operating income (loss) 73,354 13,605 ( 2,690 ) ( 8,316 ) 75,953 Depreciation and amortization 4,479 2,503 3,262 1,386 11,630 Purchases of property, plant and equipment 5,273 892 2,643 19,054 27,862 For the Year Ended June 30, 2020 MasterCraft Crest NauticStar Aviara Consolidated Net sales $ 236,856 $ 61,688 $ 54,930 $ 9,599 $ 363,073 Operating income (loss) 35,833 ( 42,115 ) ( 17,681 ) ( 2,604 ) ( 26,567 ) Impairments — 43,238 13,199 — 56,437 Depreciation and amortization 4,078 2,394 3,454 601 10,527 Purchases of property, plant and equipment 5,003 5,244 2,804 1,190 14,241 The following table presents total assets for the Company’s reportable segments as of June 30, 2022, and 2021.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION Our fiscal year begins on July 1 and ends on June 30 with the interim quarterly reporting periods consisting of thirteen weeks. Therefore, the quarter end will not always coincide with the date of the end of the calendar month. We refer to our fiscal years based on the calendar-year in which they end. Accordingly, references to fiscal 2021, fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 represent our financial results for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021, June 30, 2020 and June 30, 2019, respectively. For ease of reference, we identify our fiscal years in this Form 10-K by reference to the period from July 1 to June 30 of the year in which the fiscal year ends. For example, “fiscal 2021” refers to our fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 and “fiscal 2022” refers to our fiscal year ending June 30, 2022. MasterCraft Boat Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”), a Delaware corporation, operates primarily through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, MasterCraft Boat Company, LLC, MasterCraft Services, LLC, MasterCraft Parts, Ltd., MasterCraft International Sales Administration, Inc., Aviara Boats, LLC (“Aviara”), Nautic Star, LLC, NS Transport, LLC and Crest Marine, LLC. Unless the context otherwise requires, the Company and its subsidiaries collectively are referred to as the “Company,” “we,” or “us” in this Form 10-K. 1 PART I ITEM 1. BUSINESS We are a leading designer, manufacturer, and marketer of recreational powerboats sold under a diversified portfolio of four brands, MasterCraft, NauticStar, Crest, and Aviara. Through our four brands, we have leading market share positions in three of the fastest growing categories of the powerboat industry, ski/wake boats, outboard saltwater fishing, and pontoon boats, while entering the large, growing luxury day boat segment. As a leader in recreational marine, we strive to deliver the best on-water experience through innovative, high-quality products with a relentless focus on the consumer. Our strategy is centered on four key pillars: • Consumer Experience: Delivering the best experience throughout the life-cycle of the consumer journey; • Digital Marketing: Accelerating consumer acquisition and retention by activating a stronger, more consumer-driven digital marketing strategy; • Operational Excellence: Providing best-in-class products to consumers at an exceptional value; and • People: Developing a high-performing work organization and work environment that is consumer-focused and attracts and retains superior employees. Our Segments MasterCraft Segment Our MasterCraft segment consists of our MasterCraft brand, which manufactures premium ski/wake boats, and our Aviara brand, which manufactures luxury day boats. The MasterCraft brand was founded in 1968 and evolved over the next 50-plus years to become the most award-winning ski/wake boat manufacturer in the world. Today, MasterCraft participates in the fastest growing category within the powerboat industry by producing the industry’s premier competitive water ski, wakeboarding, and wake surfing performance boats. We believe the MasterCraft brand is known among boating enthusiasts for high performance, premier quality, and relentless innovation. We believe that the market recognizes MasterCraft as a premier brand in the powerboat industry due to the overall superior value proposition that our boats deliver to consumers. We work tirelessly every day to maintain this iconic brand reputation. Aviara is a de novo brand, developed in-house, and focused on serving the luxury recreational day boat category of the powerboat industry. Introduced in February 2019, Aviara is currently focused on models between 30 feet and 40 feet in length and currently features three models utilizing both outboard and sterndrive propulsion. Aviara boats feature distinct European styling and offer an elevated open water experience by fusing progressive style and effortless comfort in its modern luxury vessels. NauticStar Segment Our NauticStar segment consists of our NauticStar brand, which manufactures saltwater fishing boats, deck boats, and bay boats designed for a variety of uses, including recreational and competitive sport fishing in freshwater lakes or saltwater, and general recreational enjoyment. NauticStar participates in the third-fastest growing category in the powerboat industry. NauticStar, which we acquired in October 2017, was founded in 2002. We believe NauticStar has a reputation for reliability, quality and consistency, with a loyal network of dealers and consumers including professional and sport fishermen, and recreational and pleasure boating enthusiasts. Crest Segment Our Crest segment consists of our Crest brand, which manufactures pontoon boats. Crest participates in the second-fastest growing category in the powerboat industry. Crest, which we acquired in October 2018, was founded in 1957 and has grown to be one of the top producers of innovative, high-quality pontoon boats ranging from 20 to 29 feet. Crest’s long-standing reputation for high-quality, standard features and content, and innovation provides Crest with strong dealer and consumer bases in its core geographic markets. Unless the context otherwise requires, “MasterCraft,” “NauticStar,” and “Crest,” as used herein, refers to our segments as described above. 2 Our Products We design, manufacture, and sell premium recreational ski/wake, outboard, and sterndrive boats that we believe deliver superior performance for water skiing, wakeboarding, wake surfing, and fishing, as well as general recreational boating. In addition, we offer various accessories, including trailers and aftermarket parts. Our MasterCraft portfolio of ProStar, XStar, X, XT, and NXT models are designed for the highest levels of performance, styling, and enjoyment for both recreational and competitive use. The XStar and X models are geared towards the consumer seeking the most premium and highest performance boating experience that we offer, and generally command a price premium over our competitors’ boats at retail prices ranging from approximately $160,000 to $220,000. The MasterCraft XT lineup is designed to offer ultimate flexibility to consumers with maximum customization and maximum performance at retail prices ranging from approximately $100,000 to $160,000. The NXT models offer the quality, performance, styling, and innovation of the MasterCraft brand to the entry-level consumer, with retail prices ranging from approximately $80,000 to $100,000. We have strategically designed and priced the MasterCraft NXT models to target the fast-growing entry-level consumer group that is distinct from our traditional consumer base, while maintaining our core MasterCraft brand attributes at profit margins comparable to our other offerings. Our Aviara portfolio of luxury recreational day boats was designed in-house with the vision to create pleasure crafts that defy compromise. The Aviara brand drew on MasterCraft’s 50-plus year legacy of quality. Aviara’s boat designs were inspired by four product design principles – Progressive Style, Elevated Control, Modern Comfort and Quality Details. Aviara’s models consist of the AV32, a 32-foot luxury bowrider, the AV36, a 36-foot luxury bowrider, and the AV40, the brand’s flagship 40-foot luxury bowrider for the ultimate on-the-water experience. All models are available in either outboard or sterndrive propulsion, and Aviara’s retail prices range from approximately $370,000 to over $900,000. The AV32 and AV36 began selling in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021, respectively, and the AV40 is expected to begin selling in fiscal 2022. In addition, we believe there will be significant model expansion opportunities for Aviara. Our NauticStar portfolio of Bay Boats, Sport Deck Boats and Offshore Boats are designed for a variety of uses, including recreational and competitive sport fishing in freshwater lakes or saltwater, and general recreational enjoyment. NauticStar’s Bay Boats and Offshore Boats are geared towards the consumer seeking unmatched quality and features for fishability and family friendly comfort. The Sport Deck Boat line caters to consumers seeking the drive and ride of a V-hull, large capacity, and the styling and efficiency of a runabout. NauticStar’s retail prices range from approximately $40,000 to $200,000. We believe all of the NauticStar models represent a tremendous value for consumers. Our Crest portfolio of pontoon boats are designed for the ultimate in comfort and recreational pleasure boating. Crest has continued to grow market share as it expands its distribution footprint. Crest’s pontoon boats are designed to offer consumers the best in luxury, style and performance without compromise across a diverse model lineup ranging in length from 20 to 29 feet. Crest’s retail prices range from approximately $30,000 to $200,000. Our Dealer Network Our products are sold through extensive networks of independent dealers in North America and internationally. We target our distribution to the market category’s highest performing dealers. The majority of our MasterCraft brand dealers are exclusive to our MasterCraft product lines within the ski/wake category, highlighting the commitment of our key dealers to the MasterCraft brand. Our other brands are generally served on a nonexclusive basis by their respective dealers. We consistently review our distribution networks to identify opportunities to expand our geographic footprint and improve our coverage of the market. We constantly monitor the health and strength of our dealers by analyzing each dealer’s retail sales and inventory and have established processes to identify underperforming dealers in order to assist them in improving their performance, to allow us to switch to a more effective dealer, or to direct product to markets with the greatest retail demand. These processes also allow us to better monitor dealer inventory levels and product turns and contribute to a healthier dealer network that is better able to stock and sell our products. We believe our outstanding dealer networks and our proactive approach to dealer management allow us to distribute our products more efficiently than our competitors and will help us capitalize on growth opportunities as our industry volumes continue to increase. For fiscal 2021, the Company’s top ten dealers accounted for approximately 30% of our net sales and none of our dealers individually accounted for more than 6% of our total net sales. North America. In North America, our MasterCraft brand, had a total of 106 dealers across 134 locations as of June 30, 2021. Our NauticStar brand had a total of 88 dealers across 100 locations in North America as of June 30, 2021. Our Crest brand had a total of 128 dealers across 152 locations in North America as of June 30, 2021. Our Aviara brand is sold through a distribution network consisting of one dealer with 77 locations. Outside of North America. As of June 30, 2021, through our MasterCraft brand, we had a total of 40 international dealers and 40 locations and through our NauticStar brand we had one international dealer in one location. Our Crest brand had a total of two 3 international dealers in two locations. We are prese nt in Europe, Australia, South America, Africa, Asia, including Hong Kong and the Middle East. We generated 4.5%, 4.8%, and 5.2% our net sales outside of North America in fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Dealer Relations We have developed a system of financial incentives for our dealers based on achievement of key benchmarks. In addition, we provide our dealers with comprehensive sales training and a complete set of technology-based tools designed to help dealers maximize performance. Our dealer incentive program has been refined through years of experience with some of the key elements including wholesale rebates, retail rebates and promotions, other allowances, and floor plan reimbursement or cash discounts to encourage balanced production throughout the year. Beyond our incentive programs, we have developed a proprietary web-based management tool that is used by our dealers on a day-to-day basis to improve their own businesses as well as enhance communication with our factory and sales management teams. Our business-to-business application efficiently executes many critical functions, including warranty registrations, warranty claims, boat ordering and tracking, parts ordering, technical support, and inventory reporting. This system facilitates communication between our sales team and the dealer network and allows our manufacturing department to review consumer demand in real time. Manufacturing MasterCraft boats and trailers are manufactured and lake-tested at our 285,000-square-foot facility located in Vonore, Tennessee. We believe MasterCraft has the only boat manufacturing facility to achieve compliance with all three of the ISO 9001 (Quality Management Systems), 14001 (Environmental Management Systems), and 18001 (International Occupational Health and Safety Management System) standards. NauticStar boats are manufactured at our 200,000-square-foot facility located in Amory, Mississippi. Crest boats are manufactured at our 150,000-square-foot facility located in Owosso, Michigan. In October 2020, we purchased a 140,000-square-foot boat manufacturing facility in Merritt Island, Florida. Aviara boats were manufactured in our Vonore, Tennessee facility until the third quarter of fiscal 2021 and are now manufactured solely at our Merritt Island, Florida facility. The rigorous and consumer-centric attention to detail in the design and manufacturing of our products results in boats of high quality which provides an exceptional on water experience across all of our brands. Our dedication to quality permits our consumers to enjoy our products with confidence. Our boats are built through a continuous flow manufacturing process that encompasses fabrication, assembly, quality management, and testing. We manufacture certain components and subassemblies for our boats, such as upholstery, and procure other components from third-party vendors and install them on the boat. We have several exclusive supplier partnerships for critical purchased components, such as aluminum billet, towers, and engine packages. For MasterCraft, we also build custom trailers that match the exact size and color of our boats. Suppliers We purchase a wide variety of raw materials from our supplier base, including resins, fiberglass, aluminum, lumber and steel, as well as product parts and components such as engines and electronic controls. We maintain long-term contracts with strategic suppliers and informal arrangements with other suppliers. We are focused on working with our supply chain partners to enable cost improvement, world-class quality, and continuous product innovation. We have engaged our key suppliers in collaborative preferred supplier relationships and have developed processes including annual cost reduction targets, regular reliability projects, and extensive product testing requirements to ensure that our suppliers produce at lowest total cost and to the highest levels of quality expected of our brands. These collaborative efforts begin at the design stage, with our key suppliers integrated into design and development planning well in advance of launch, which allows us to control costs and to leverage the expertise of our suppliers in developing product innovations. We believe these collaborative relationships with our most important suppliers have contributed to our significant improvements in product quality, innovation, and profitability. The most significant components used in manufacturing our boats, based on cost, are engine packages. For our MasterCraft brand, Ilmor Engineering, Inc. (“Ilmor”) is our exclusive engine supplier, and for our NauticStar brand, Yamaha Motor Corporation (“Yamaha”) is our largest engine supplier, while Mercury Marine (“Mercury”) is the largest engine supplier for our Crest Brand. For our Aviara brand, Mercury provides outboard engines and Ilmor provides sterndrive engines. We maintain strong and long-standing relationships with Ilmor, Yamaha, and Mercury. During the year ended June 30, 2021, Ilmor was our largest overall supplier. In addition to ski/wake and sterndrive engines, Ilmor’s affiliates produce engines used in a number of leading racing boats and race cars. Ilmor maintains a full-time customer service and warranty representative at our MasterCraft office, resulting in extremely efficient management of all engine-related matters, mitigating potential warranty risk. We work closely with Ilmor to remain at the forefront of 4 engine design, performance, and manufacturing. W e believe our long-term relationship with our engine supplier partners is a key competitive advantage. We have and continue to see supply chain disruptions that we believe are caused by the dislocation in the labor and logistics markets as well as upstream supply challenges. Research and Development, Product Development and Engineering We are strategically and financially committed to innovation, as reflected in our dedicated product development and engineering groups and evidenced by our track record of new product and feature introduction. Since June 30, 2020, the Company has approximately doubled the number of product development and engineering personnel, further solidifying our commitment to being the most consumer-centric and innovative company in our industry. As of June 30, 2021, our product development and engineering group includes 47 professionals. These individuals bring to our product development efforts significant expertise across core disciplines, including boat design, computer-aided design, naval engineering, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering. They are responsible for execution of all facets of our new product and innovation strategy, starting with design and development of new boat models and innovative features, engineering these designs for manufacturing, and integrating new boats and features into production. Our product development and engineering functions work closely with our Strategic Portfolio Management Team which includes senior leadership from Sales, Marketing and Finance, all working together to develop our long-term product and innovation strategies. We have structured processes to obtain consumer, dealer, and management feedback to guide our long-term product lifecycle and portfolio planning. In addition, extensive testing and coordination with our manufacturing groups are important elements of our product development process, which we believe enable us to leverage the lessons from past launches and minimize the risk associated with the release of new products. We have developed a strategy to launch several new models each year, which will allow us to renew our product portfolio with innovative offerings at a rate that we believe will be difficult for our competitors to match without significant additional capital investments. In addition to our product strategy, we manage a separate innovation development process which allows us to design innovative new features for our boats in a disciplined manner and to launch these innovations in a more rapid time frame and with higher quality. These enhanced processes have reduced the time to market for our new product pipeline. Our research and product development expense for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $6.8 million, $5.2 million, and $5.6 million, respectively. Intellectual Property We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, and copyright protection, trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, and contractual provisions to protect our rights in our brands, products, and proprietary technology. We also protect our vessel hull designs through vessel hull design registrations. This is an important part of our business and we intend to continue protecting our intellectual property. We currently hold 43 U.S. patents and six foreign patents, including utility and design patents for our transom surf seating, our DockStar handling system, and our SurfStar surf system technology among numerous other innovations. Provided that we comply with all statutory maintenance requirements, our patents are expected to expire between 2028 and 2039. We also have additional patent applications pending in the U.S. and worldwide. We also own in excess of 130 trademark registrations in various countries around the world, most notably for the MasterCraft, NauticStar, Crest, and Aviara names and/or logos, as well as numerous model names in MasterCraft’s Star Series, X, XT, and NXT product families, and we have several pending applications for additional registrations. Such trademarks may endure in perpetuity on a country-by-country basis provided that we comply with all statutory maintenance requirements, including continued use of each trademark in each such country. In addition, we own 38 registered U.S. copyrights. Finally, we have registered more than 40 vessel hull designs with the U.S. Copyright Office, the most recent of which will remain in force through 2027. Competitive Conditions and Position We believe each of our brands are highly competitive and have a reputation for quality. We compete by operating, developing, and acquiring a diversified portfolio of leading brands focused on the fastest growing segments of the powerboat industry; focusing relentlessly on delivering the best overall ownership experience to consumers; developing and continuously improving highly efficient production techniques and methods which result in highly innovative products; distributing our products through extensive, consumer-driven independent dealer networks; and attracting, developing, and retaining high-performing employees. Significant competition exists for each of our brands and the markets in which we compete range from being relatively concentrated for the ski/wake category, to being fragmented for the pontoon, and deck and saltwater fishing categories. As of December 2020, based on Statistical Surveys, Inc. (“SSI”) data, the top five brands accounted for over 75% of the ski/wake markets, approximately 55% for the pontoon market, and approximately 32% of the deck and saltwater fishing category. Market participants also range from small, single-product businesses to large, diversified companies. In addition, we compete indirectly with businesses that offer alternative leisure products and activities. 5 In recent history, the MasterCraft brand has consistently competed for the leading market share position in the U.S. among manufacturers of premium ski/wake boats based on unit volume. As of December 2020 , based on SSI data, the MasterCraf t brand has the #1 market share in the ski/wake category with 21. 0 %. As of December 2020, based on SSI data, the NauticStar brand has the #9 market share in the deck and saltwater fishing category with 4.1%. As of December 2020, based on SSI data, the Crest brand has the #8 market share in the pontoon category with 3.6%. As of December 2020, based on SSI data, the Aviara brand has the # 10 market share in the 30-foot to 40-foot bowrider category with 2. 6 %. Human Capital Resources We have approximately 1,500 employees as of June 30, 2021, of whom 750 work at our MasterCraft facility in Tennessee, 150 work at our Aviara facility in Florida, 300 work at our NauticStar facility in Mississippi, and 300 work at our Crest facility in Michigan. We have grown our workforce by more than 600 employees during fiscal 2021 as we ramp up our operations to meet the demand for our products. One of our four strategic priorities is developing a high-performing work organization and work environment that is consumer-focused and attracts and retains superior employees. We strive to offer our employees career-specific tools, training, resources, and support development opportunities. We utilize a talent management process, which includes performance appraisal and development planning. We are also deeply invested in attracting and developing the next generation of workforce talent to the boating industry. We’ve partnered with local community and technical colleges by developing training programs and donating boats and supplies to position graduates for jobs in the boating industry upon graduation. Employee safety is always a top priority. We are focused on improving and innovating when it comes to the well-being of our dedicated workforce across our portfolio of brands. We take great care to ensure everyone at the Company is empowered to do their best work, in a safe and well-managed environment. We maintain clean, safe and healthy workplaces through our vigorous training programs and professional safety standards systems, including job hazard assessments and industrial hygiene and ventilation practices. Our compensation program is designed to facilitate high performance and generate results that will create value for our stockholders. We structure executive compensation to pay for performance, reward our executives with equity in the Company in order to align their interests with the interests of our stockholders and allow those employees to share in our stockholders’ success, which we believe creates a performance culture, maintains morale and attracts, motivates and retains top talent. Environmental, Safety, and Regulatory Matters Our operations are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations, including those concerning product safety, environmental protection, and occupational health and safety. We believe that our operations and products are in compliance with these regulatory requirements. Historically, the cost of achieving and maintaining compliance with applicable laws and regulations has not been material. However, we cannot provide assurance that future costs and expenses required for us to comply with such laws and regulations, including any new or modified regulatory requirements, or to address newly discovered environmental conditions, will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, or cash flows. We have not been notified of and are otherwise currently not aware of any contamination at our current or former facilities for which we could be liable under environmental laws or regulations and we currently are not undertaking any remediation or investigation activities in connection with any contamination. However, future spills or accidents or the discovery of currently unknown conditions or non-compliances may give rise to investigation and remediation obligations or related liabilities and damage claims, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, or cash flows. Other Information We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware under the name MCBC Holdings, Inc. on January 28, 2000. In July 2015, we completed an initial public offering of our common stock. Effective November 7, 2018, the name of the Company was changed from MCBC Holdings, Inc. to MasterCraft Boat Holdings, Inc. We maintain a website with the address www.mastercraft.com. We are not including the information contained in our website as part of, or incorporating it by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We make available, free of charge through our website, our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to these reports as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file these materials with, or otherwise furnish them to, the SEC. 6 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS RISK FACTORS Our operations and financial results are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including those described below, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common stock. Risks Relating to Economic and Market Conditions Global economic conditions, particularly in the U.S., significantly affect our industry and businesses, and economic decline can materially impact our financial results. In times of economic uncertainty or recession, consumers tend to have less discretionary income and to defer significant spending on non-essential items, which may adversely affect our financial performance. Although portions of the marine industry have experienced positive trends as a result of the unique consumer environment resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, these trends may not continue, and the accompanying economic uncertainty caused by the pandemic may lead to unfavorable business outcomes. We continue to develop our portfolio of brands, but our business remains cyclical and sensitive to consumer spending on new boats. Deterioration in general economic conditions that in turn diminishes consumer confidence or discretionary income may reduce our sales, or we may decide to lower pricing for our products, which could adversely affect our financial results, including increasing the potential for future impairment charges. Further, our products are recreational, and consumers’ limited discretionary income in times of economic hardship may be diverted to other activities that occupy their time, such as other forms of recreational, religious, cultural, or community activities. We cannot predict the strength of global economies or the timing of economic recovery, either globally or in the specific markets in which we compete. Fiscal concerns and policy changes may negatively impact worldwide economic and credit conditions and adversely affect our industry, businesses, and financial condition. Fiscal policy could have a material adverse impact on worldwide economic conditions, the financial markets, and availability of credit and, consequently, may negatively affect our industry, businesses, and overall financial condition. Customers often finance purchases of our products, and as interest rates rise, the cost of financing the purchase also increases. While credit availability is adequate to support demand and interest rates remain relatively low, if credit conditions worsen and adversely affect the ability of customers to finance potential purchases at acceptable terms and interest rates, it could result in a decrease in sales or delay improvement in sales. Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly. Borrowings under our revolving credit facility and term loans are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. Reference rates used to determine the applicable interest rates for our debt are currently at relatively low levels. If interest rates increase, the debt service obligations on our indebtedness will increase even if the amount borrowed remains the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease. Please see Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” for discussion of our market risk related to interest rates. In addition, our variable rate indebtedness may use LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the rate. In March 2021, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) publicly announced the transition dates of certain LIBOR settings. Included in that, it was announced that 1-month, 3-month and 6-month U.S. Dollar LIBOR settings will cease to be provided immediately after June 30, 2023. There is no assurance that dates announced by the FCA will not change or that the administrator of LIBOR and/or regulators will not take further action that could impact the availability, composition, or characteristics of LIBOR or the currencies and/or tenors for which LIBOR is published. Uncertainty as to the nature of alternative reference rates and as to potential changes or other reforms to LIBOR may adversely impact the availability and cost of borrowings. Inflation could adversely affect our financial results The market prices of certain materials and components used in manufacturing our products, especially resins that are made with hydrocarbon feedstocks, fiberglass, aluminum, lumber, and steel, can be volatile. While, historically, inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations, significant increases in inflation, particularly those related to wages and increases in the cost of raw materials, recently have, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 7 In addition, n ew boat buyers often finance their purchases. Inflation typically results in higher interest rates that could translate into an increased cost of boat ownership. Should inflation and increased interest rates occur, prospective consumers may choose to forego or delay their purchases or buy a less expensive boat in the event credit is not available to finance their boat purchases. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our results. We sell products manufactured in the U.S. into certain international markets in U.S. dollars. The changing relationship of the U.S. dollar to foreign currencies has, from time to time, had a negative impact on our results of operations. Fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to these foreign currencies can adversely affect the price of our products in foreign markets and the costs we incur to import certain components for our products. We will often attempt to offset these higher prices with increased discounts, which can lead to reduced net sales per unit. An increase in energy costs may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Higher energy costs result in increases in operating expenses at our manufacturing facilities and in the expense of shipping products to our dealers. In addition, increases in energy costs may adversely affect the pricing and availability of petroleum-based raw materials, such as resins and foams that are used in our products. Higher fuel prices may also have an adverse effect on demand for our boats, as they increase the cost of boat ownership and possibly affect product use. Risks Relating to Our Business Actual or potential public health emergencies, epidemics, or pandemics, such as the current coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. The impact of actual or potential public health emergencies, epidemics, or pandemics on the Company, our suppliers, dealers, and customers, and the general economy could be wide-ranging and significant, depending on the nature of the issue, governmental actions taken in response, and the public reaction. The impact of the current COVID-19 pandemic includes illness, quarantines, cancellation of events and travel, business and school shutdowns, reduction in economic activity, widespread unemployment, and supply chain interruptions, which collectively have caused significant disruptions to global economies and financial markets. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, demand for our products increased in fiscal 2021 versus fiscal 2020, but the pandemic could result in future significant volatility in demand, positively or negatively, for our products. Demand volatility may be caused by, among other things: the temporary inability of consumers to purchase our products due to illness, quarantine, or other travel restrictions; dealership closures due to illness or government restrictions; a reduction in boating activity as a result of governmental actions or self-quarantine measures; shifts in demand away from discretionary products; and reduced options for marketing and promotion of products or other restrictions in connection with COVID-19. If such events occurred over a prolonged period, they could increase our costs and difficulty of operating our business, including accurately planning and forecasting for our operations and inventory levels, which may adversely impact our results. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in, and may continue to result in, disruption, uncertainty, and volatility in the global financial and credit markets. Such volatility could impact our access to capital resources and liquidity in the future, including making credit difficult to obtain or only available on less favorable terms. The COVID-19 pandemic may continue to have an impact on our operations, which could be material. For example, many of our facilities have experienced absenteeism caused by illness or quarantine measures. The continuing impact on our business operations could include, but are not limited to, significant numbers of employees contracting COVID-19; facility closures as a result of state and local ""shelter-in-place"" orders, safety precautions, employee illness, or self-quarantine measures; reductions in our operating effectiveness as our employees work from home or as a result of new workplace safety measures; unavailability of key personnel necessary to conduct our business activities; project delays; and supply chain or distribution interruptions and constraints. Additionally, we rely on original equipment manufacturers, dealers, and distributors to market and sell most of our products, and effects on their businesses or financial condition as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic could result in various adverse operational impacts including, but not limited to, lower sales, delayed cash payments, interrupted customer warranty service, and increased credit risk. Our efforts to manage, mitigate, and remedy these impacts may prove unsuccessful as the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control, including the duration and severity of the pandemic, public safety actions taken by government authorities, long-term economic recovery, and resulting consumer response. We may not be able to execute our manufacturing strategy successfully, which could cause the profitability of our products to suffer. Our manufacturing strategy is designed to improve product quality and increase productivity, while reducing costs and increasing flexibility to respond to ongoing changes in the marketplace. To implement this strategy, we must be successful in our continuous 8 improvement efforts, which depend on the involvement of management, production employees, and suppliers. Any inability to achieve these objectives could adversely impact the profitability of our products and our ability to deliver desirable products to our consumers. In addition, we have made strategic capital investments in capacity expansion activities to successfully capture growth opportunities and enhance product offerings, including relocating production of our Aviara brand to Merritt Island, Florida. This allows for a dedicated manufacturing facility of our Aviara brand and increased capacity for our MasterCraft brand at the Vonore, Tennessee facility. We must carefully manage capital expansions to ensure they meet cost targets, comply with applicable environmental, safety, and other regulations, and uphold high-quality workmanship. Moving production to a different plant and expanding capacity at an existing facility involves risks, including difficulties initiating production within the cost and timeframe estimated, supplying product to customers when expected, integrating new products, and attracting sufficient skilled labor to handle additional production demands. If we fail to meet these objectives, it could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand for products and increase the cost of production versus projections, both of which could result in a significant adverse impact on operating and financial results. Additionally, plant expansion can result in manufacturing inefficiencies, additional expenses, including higher wages or severance costs, and cost inefficiencies, which could negatively impact financial results. Adverse weather conditions and climate change events can have a negative effect on revenues. Changes in seasonal weather conditions can have a significant effect on our operating and financial results. Sales of our boats are typically stronger just before and during spring and summer, and favorable weather during these months generally has had a positive effect on consumer demand. Conversely, unseasonably cool weather, excessive rainfall, or drought conditions during these periods can reduce or change the timing of demand. Climate change could have an impact on longer-term natural weather trends, resulting in environmental changes including, but not limited to, increases in severe weather, changing sea levels, changes in sea, land and air temperatures, poor water conditions, or reduced access to water, could disrupt or negatively affect our business. Catastrophic events, including natural and environmental disasters, acts of terrorism, or civil unrest, could have a negative effect on our operations and financial results. We rely on the continuous operation of our manufacturing facilities in Vonore, Tennessee, Merritt Island, Florida, Armory, Mississippi, and Owosso, Michigan for the production of our products. Any natural disaster or other serious disruption to our facilities due to fire, snow, flood, earthquake, pandemics, civil insurrection or social unrest or any other unforeseen circumstance could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, storms, and catastrophic natural or environmental disasters, as well as acts of terrorism or civil unrest, could disrupt our distribution channel, operations, or supply chain and decrease consumer demand. If a catastrophic event takes place in one of our major sales markets, our sales could be diminished. Additionally, if such an event occurs near our business locations, manufacturing facilities or key supplier facilities, business operations, and/or operating systems could be interrupted. We could be uniquely affected by weather-related catastrophic events, as we have dealers and third-party suppliers located in regions of the United States that have been and may be exposed to damaging storms, such as hurricanes and tornados, floods and environmental disasters. Although preventative measures may help to mitigate damage, the damage and disruption resulting from natural and environmental disasters may be significant. Such disasters can disrupt our consumers, dealers, or suppliers, which can interrupt our operational processes and our sales and profits. Our ability to remain competitive depends on successfully introducing new products and services that meet consumer expectations. We believe that our customers look for and expect quality, innovation, and advanced features when evaluating and making purchasing decisions about products and services in the marketplace. Our ability to remain competitive and meet our growth objectives may be adversely affected by difficulties or delays in product development, such as an inability to develop viable new products, gain market acceptance of new products, generate sufficient capital to fund new product development, or obtain adequate intellectual property protection for new products. To meet ever-changing consumer demands, both timing of market entry and pricing of new products are critical. As a result, we may not be able to introduce new products that are necessary to remain competitive in all markets that we serve. Furthermore, we must continue to meet or exceed customers' expectations regarding product quality and after-sales service or our operating results could suffer. Our ability to meet demand in a rapidly changing environment may adversely affect our results of operations. The seasonality of retail demand for our products, together with our goal of balancing production throughout the year, requires us to manage our manufacturing and allocate our products to our dealer network to address anticipated retail demand. Production and sales levels throughout fiscal 2021 and 2020 fluctuated due in large part to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, our dealers must manage seasonal changes in consumer demand and inventory. Although we have remained focused on applying and enhancing our COVID-19 9 health and safety protocols while continuing to ramp-up production, our businesses may experience difficulty in adapting to the rapidly changing production and sales volumes. We may not be able to recruit or maintain sufficient skilled labor or our suppliers may not be able to deliver sufficient quantities of parts and components for us to match production with rapid changes in forecasted demand. In addition, consumers may pursue other recreational activities if dealer pipeline inventories fall too low and it is not convenient to purchase our products, consumers may purchase from competitors, or our fixed costs may grow in response to increased demand. A failure to adjust dealer pipeline inventory levels to meet demand could adversely impact our results of operations. Our financial results may be adversely affected by our third-party suppliers' increased costs or inability to meet required production levels due to increased demand or disruption of supply of raw materials, parts, and product components. We rely on third parties to supply raw materials used in the manufacturing process, including resins, fiberglass, aluminum, lumber and steel, as well as product parts and components. The prices for these raw materials, parts, and components fluctuate depending on market conditions and, in some instances, commodity prices or trade policies, including tariffs. Substantial increases in the prices of raw materials, parts, and components would increase our operating costs, and could reduce our profitability if we are unable to recoup the increased costs through higher product prices or improved operating efficiencies. Similarly, if a critical supplier were to close its operations, cease manufacturing, or otherwise fail to deliver an essential component necessary to our manufacturing operations, that could detrimentally affect our ability to manufacture and sell our products, resulting in an interruption in business operations and/or a loss of sales. In addition, some components used in our manufacturing processes, including engines, boat windshields, towers, and surf tabs are available from a sole supplier or a limited number of suppliers. Operational and financial difficulties that these or other suppliers may face in the future could adversely affect their ability to supply us with the parts and components we need, which could significantly disrupt our operations. It may be difficult to find a replacement supplier for a limited or sole source raw material, part, or component without significant delay or on commercially reasonable terms. In addition, an uncorrected defect or supplier's variation in a raw material, part, or component, either unknown to us or incompatible with our manufacturing process, could jeopardize our ability to manufacture products. Some additional supply risks that could disrupt our operations, impair our ability to deliver products to customers, and negatively affect our financial results include: • an outbreak of disease or facility closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic, or similar public health threat; • a deterioration of our relationships with suppliers; • events such as natural disasters, power outages, or labor strikes; • financial pressures on our suppliers due to a weakening economy or unfavorable conditions in other end markets; • supplier manufacturing constraints and investment requirements; or • termination or interruption of supply arrangements. These risks are exacerbated in the case of single-source suppliers, and the exclusive supplier of a key component could potentially exert significant bargaining power over price, quality, warranty claims, or other terms. We continue to increase production; consequently, our need for raw materials and supplies continues to increase. Our suppliers must be prepared to ramp-up operations and, in many cases, hire additional workers and/or expand capacity in order to fulfill our orders and those of other customers. Cost increases, defects, or sustained interruptions in the supply of raw materials, parts, or components due to delayed start-up periods our suppliers experience as they increase production efforts create risks to our operations and financial results. The Company experienced periodic supply shortages and increases in costs to certain materials in fiscal 2021. We continue to address these issues by identifying alternative suppliers for key materials and components, working to secure adequate inventories of critical supplies, and continually monitoring the capabilities of our supplier base. In the future, however, we may experience shortages, delayed delivery, and/or increased prices for key materials, parts, and supplies that are essential to our manufacturing operations. We have a fixed cost base that will affect our profitability if our sales decrease. The fixed cost levels of operating a powerboat manufacturer can put pressure on profit margins when sales and production decline. Our profitability depends, in part, on our ability to spread fixed costs over a sufficiently large number of products sold and shipped, and if we make a decision to reduce our rate of production, gross or net margins could be negatively affected. Consequently, decreased demand or the need to reduce production can lower our ability to absorb fixed costs and materially impact our financial condition or results of operations. Our business and operations are dependent on the expertise of our key contributors, our successful implementation of succession plans, and our ability to attract and retain management employees and skilled labor. 10 The talents and efforts of our employees, particularly key managers, are vital to our success. Our management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace. We may be unable to retain them or to attract other highly qualified employees. Failure to hire, develop, and retain highly qualified and diverse employee talent and to develop and implement an adequate succession plan for the management team could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business and our future success. We perform an annual review of management succession plans with our b oard of d irectors, including reviewing executive officer and other important positions to substantially mitigate the risk associated with key contributor transitions, but we cannot ensure that all transitions will be implemented successfully. Our ability to continue to execute our growth strategy could potentially be adversely affected by the effectiveness of organizational changes. Any disruption or uncertainty resulting from such changes could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Much of our future success depends on, among other factors, our ability to attract and retain skilled labor. In 2021, all our facilities sought to increase production and to hire and retain sufficient skilled hourly labor to meet increased demand for our products. In the future, if we are not successful in these efforts, we may be unable to meet our operating goals and plans, which may impact our financial results. We continually invest in automation and improve our efficiency, but availability and retention of skilled hourly workers remains critical to our operations. In order to manage this risk, we regularly monitor and make improvements to wages and benefit programs, as well as develop and improve recruiting, training, and safety programs to attract and retain an experienced and skilled workforce. An inability to identify and complete targeted acquisitions could negatively impact financial results. We may in the future explore acquisitions and strategic alliances that will enable us to acquire complementary skills and capabilities, offer new products, expand our consumer base, enter new product categories or geographic markets, and obtain other competitive advantages. We cannot provide assurance, however, that we will identify acquisition candidates or strategic partners that are suitable to our business, obtain financing on satisfactory terms, or complete acquisitions or strategic alliances. In managing our acquisition strategy, we conduct rigorous due diligence, involve various functions, and continually review target acquisitions, all of which we believe mitigates some of our acquisition risks. However, we cannot assure that suitable acquisitions will be identified or consummated or that, if consummated, they will be successful. Acquisitions include a number of risks, including our ability to project and evaluate market demand, realize potential synergies and cost savings, and make accurate accounting estimates, as well as diversion of management attention. Uncertainties exist in assessing the value, risks, profitability, and liabilities associated with certain companies or assets, negotiating acceptable terms, obtaining financing on acceptable terms, and receiving any necessary regulatory approvals. As we continue to grow, in part, through acquisitions, our success depends on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these risks. Our failure to successfully do so could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The inability to successfully integrate acquisitions could negatively impact financial results. Our strategic acquisitions pose risks, such as our ability to project and evaluate market demand; maximize potential synergies and cost savings; make accurate accounting estimates; and achieve anticipated business objectives. Acquisitions we may complete in the future, present these and other integration risks, including: • the possibility that the expected synergies and value creation will not be realized or will not be realized within the expected time period; • the risk that unexpected costs and liabilities will be incurred; • diversion of management attention; and • difficulties retaining employees. If we fail to timely and successfully integrate new businesses into existing operations, we may see higher costs, lost sales, or otherwise diminished earnings and financial results. We depend on our network of independent dealers which creates additional risks. Substantially all of our sales are derived from our network of independent dealers. Maintaining a reliable network of dealers is essential to our success. Our agreements with dealers in our networks typically provide for one-year terms, although some agreements have longer terms. The loss of one or more of these dealers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The number of dealers supporting our products and the quality of their marketing and servicing efforts are essential to our ability to generate sales. We face competition from other manufacturers in attracting and retaining independent boat dealers. Although our management believes that the quality of our products in the premium performance sport, outboard boat, and sterndrive boat industries should permit us to maintain our relationships with our dealers and our market share position, there can be no 11 assurance that we will be able to maintain or improve our relationships with our dealers or our market share position. In addition, independent dealers in the powerboat industry have experienced significant consolidation in recent years, which could result in the loss of one or more of our dealers in the future if the surviving entity in any such consolidation purchases similar products from a competitor. A significant deterioration in the number or effectiveness of our dealers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows . Although at present we believe dealer health to be generally favorable, weakening demand for marine products could hurt our dealers’ financial performance. In particular, reduced cash flow from decreases in sales and tightening credit markets could impair dealers' ability to fund operations. Inability to fund operations can force dealers to cease business, and we may be unable to obtain alternate distribution in the vacated market. An inability to obtain alternate distribution could unfavorably affect our net sales through reduced market presence. If economic conditions deteriorate, we anticipate that dealer failures or voluntary market exits would increase, especially if overall retail demand materially declines. Our dealers require adequate liquidity to finance their operations, including purchasing our products. Dealers are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could unfavorably affect their liquidity positions, including, among other things, continued access to adequate financing sources on a timely basis on reasonable terms. These financing sources are vital to our ability to sell products through our network of dealers. Many of our dealers have floor plan financing arrangements with third-party finance companies. Many factors, including creditworthiness of our dealers and overall aging and level of pipeline inventories, continue to influence the availability and terms of financing that our dealers are able to secure, which could adversely affect sales of our products. We may be required to repurchase inventory of certain dealers. Floor plan financing arrangements with third-party finance companies enable dealers to purchase our products. In connection with these agreements, we may have an obligation to repurchase our products from a finance company under certain circumstances. This obligation is triggered if a dealer defaults on its debt obligations to a finance company. In addition, applicable laws regulating dealer relations may also require us to repurchase our products from our dealers under certain circumstances. In such circumstances, we may not have any control over the timing or amount of any repurchase obligation nor have access to capital on terms acceptable to us to satisfy any repurchase obligation. If we were obligated to repurchase a significant number of units under any repurchase agreement or under applicable dealer laws, our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected. Future declines in marine industry demand could cause an increase in repurchase activity or could require us to incur losses in excess of established reserves. In addition, our cash flow and loss experience could be adversely affected if repurchased inventory is not successfully distributed to other dealers in a timely manner, or if the recovery rate on the resale of the product declines. The finance companies could require changes in repurchase terms that would result in an increase in our contractual obligations. Our industry is characterized by intense competition, which affects our sales and profits. The premium performance sport boat, outboard, and sterndrive boat categories and the powerboat industry as a whole are highly competitive for consumers and dealers. We also compete against consumer demand for used boats. Competition affects our ability to succeed in both the markets we currently serve and new markets that we may enter in the future. Competition is based primarily on brand name, price, product selection, and product performance. We compete with several large manufacturers that may have greater financial, marketing, and other resources than we do and who are represented by dealers in the markets in which we now operate and into which we plan to expand. We also compete with a variety of small, independent manufacturers. We cannot provide assurance that we will not face greater competition from existing large or small manufacturers or that we will be able to compete successfully with new competitors. Our failure to compete effectively with our current and future competitors would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We compete with a variety of other activities for consumers’ scarce leisure time. Our boats are used for recreational and sport purposes, and demand for our boats may be adversely affected by competition from other activities that occupy consumers’ leisure time and by changes in consumer lifestyle, usage pattern, or taste. Similarly, an overall decrease in consumer leisure time may reduce consumers’ willingness to purchase and enjoy our products. Our sales may be adversely impacted by increased consumer preference for used boats or the supply of new boats by competitors in excess of demand. During the economic downturn that commenced in 2008, we observed a shift in consumer demand toward purchasing more used boats, primarily because prices for used boats are typically lower than retail prices for new boats. If this were to occur again (including as a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic), it could have the effect of reducing demand among retail purchasers for our new boats. Also, while we have taken steps designed to balance production volumes for our boats with demand, our competitors could choose to reduce the price of their products, which could have the effect of reducing demand for our new boats. Reduced demand for new boats could lead to reduced sales by us, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 12 Significant product repair and/or replacement due to product warranty claims or product recalls could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. We provide a limited warranty for our products. We may provide additional warranties related to certain promotional programs, as well as warranties in certain geographical markets as determined by local regulations and market conditions. Although we employ quality control procedures, sometimes a product is distributed that needs repair or replacement. Our standard warranties require us or our dealers to repair or replace defective products during such warranty periods at no cost to the consumer. Historically, product recalls have been administered through our dealers and distributors. The repair and replacement costs we could incur in connection with a recall could adversely affect our business. In addition, product recalls could harm our reputation and cause us to lose consumers, particularly if recalls cause consumers to question the safety or reliability of our products. Our business operations could be negatively impacted by an outage or breach of our information technology systems, network disruptions, or a cybersecurity event. We manage our business operations through a variety of information technology systems and their underlying infrastructure, which we continually enhance to increase efficiency and security. In addition to the disruptions in our information technology systems, cybersecurity threats and sophisticated and targeted cyberattacks pose a risk to our information technology systems. We have established security policies, processes, and defenses, including employee awareness training regarding phishing, malware, and other cyber risks, designed to help identify and protect against intentional and unintentional misappropriation or corruption of our information technology systems and information and disruption of our operations. Despite these efforts, our information technology systems may be damaged, disrupted, or shut down due to attacks by unauthorized access, malicious software, computer viruses, undetected intrusion, hardware failures, or other events, and in these circumstances our disaster recovery plans may be ineffective or inadequate. These breaches or intrusions could lead to business interruption, exposure of proprietary or confidential information, data corruption, damage to our reputation, exposure to legal and regulatory proceedings, and other costs. A security breach might also lead to violations of privacy laws, regulations, trade guidelines or practices related to our customers and associates and could result in potential claims from customers, associates, shareholders, or regulatory agencies. Such events could adversely impact our reputation, business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, we could be adversely affected if any of our significant customers or suppliers experiences any similar events that disrupt their business operations or damage their reputation. While we maintain monitoring practices and protections of our information technology to reduce these risks and test our systems on an ongoing basis for potential threats, there can be no assurance that these efforts will prevent a cyber-attack or other security breach. We carry cybersecurity insurance to help mitigate the financial exposure and related notification procedures in the event of intentional intrusion; however, there can be no assurance that our insurance will adequately protect against potential losses that could adversely affect our business. We rely on third parties for computing, storage, processing, and similar services. Any disruption of or interference with our use of these third-party services could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. Many of our business systems reside on third-party outsourced cloud infrastructure providers. We are therefore vulnerable to service interruptions experienced by these providers and could experience interruptions, delays, or outages in service availability in the future due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human, hardware or software errors, hosting disruptions, and capacity constraints. While we have mitigation and service redundancy plans in place, outages and/or capacity constraints could still arise from a number of causes such as technical failures, natural disasters, fraud, or internal or third-party security attacks, which could negatively impact our ability to manufacture and/or operate our business. Our credit facilities contain covenants which may limit our operating flexibility; failure to comply with covenants may result in our lenders restricting or terminating our ability to borrow under such credit facilities. In the past, we have relied on our existing credit facilities to provide us with adequate liquidity to operate our business. The availability of borrowing amounts under our credit facilities is dependent on compliance with the debt covenants set forth in our credit agreement. Violation of those covenants, whether as a result of operating losses or otherwise, could result in our lenders restricting or terminating our borrowing ability under our credit facilities. If our lenders reduce or terminate our access to amounts under our credit facilities, we may not have sufficient capital to fund our working capital and other needs, and we may need to secure additional capital or financing to fund our operations or to repay outstanding debt under our credit facilities. We cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in ensuring the availability of amounts under our credit facilities or in raising additional capital, or that any amount, if raised, will be sufficient to meet our cash needs or will be on terms as favorable as those which have been available to us historically. If we are not able to maintain our ability to borrow under our credit facilities, or to raise additional capital when needed, our business and operations will be materially adversely affected. 13 Risks Relating to Intellectual Property Our success depends on the continued strength of our brands and the value of our brands, and sales of our products could be diminished if we, the athletes who use our products, or the sports and activities in which our products are used are associated with negative publicity. We believe that our brands are a significant contributor to the success of our business and that maintaining and enhancing our brands is important to expanding our consumer and dealer base. Failure to continue to protect our brands may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Negative publicity, including that resulting from severe injuries or death occurring in the sports and activities in which our products are used, could negatively affect our reputation and result in restrictions, recalls, or bans on the use of our products. Further, actions taken by athletes associated with our products that harm the reputations of those athletes could also harm our brand image and adversely affect our financial condition. If the popularity of the sports and activities for which we design, manufacture, and sell products were to decrease as a result of these risks or any negative publicity, sales of our products could decrease, which could have an adverse effect on our net sales, profitability, and operating results. In addition, if we become exposed to additional claims and litigation relating to the use of our products, our reputation may be adversely affected by such claims, whether or not successful, including by generating potential negative publicity about our products, which could adversely impact our business and financial condition. Our intellectual property rights may be inadequate to protect our business. We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, protected design, and trade secret laws; employee and third-party non-disclosure agreements; and other contracts to establish and protect our technology and other intellectual property rights. However, we remain subject to risks, including: • the steps we take to protect our proprietary technology may be inadequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology; • third parties may independently develop similar technology; • agreements containing protections may be breached or terminated; • we may not have adequate remedies for breaches; • pending patent, trademark, and copyright applications may not be approved; • existing patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws may afford limited protection; • a third party could copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology without authorization; or • we may be required to litigate to enforce our intellectual property rights, and we may not be successful. Policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and litigating intellectual property claims may result in substantial cost and divert management’s attention. In addition, we may be required to defend our products against patent or other intellectual property infringement claims or litigation. Besides defense expenses and costs, we may not prevail in such cases, forcing us to seek licenses or royalty arrangements from third parties, which we may not be able to obtain on reasonable terms, or subjecting us to an order or requirement to stop manufacturing, using, selling, or distributing products that included challenged intellectual property, which could harm our business and financial results. If third parties claim that we infringe on their intellectual property rights, our financial condition could be adversely affected. We face the risk of claims that we have infringed third parties’ intellectual property rights. Any claims of patent or other intellectual property infringement, even those without merit, could be expensive and time consuming to defend, cause us to cease making, licensing, or using products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property, require us to redesign, reengineer, or rebrand our products, if feasible, divert management’s attention and resources, or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use a third party’s intellectual property. Any royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. A successful claim of infringement against us could result in our being required to pay significant damages, enter into costly license or royalty agreements, or stop the sale of certain products, any of which could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. While we are not currently involved in any outstanding intellectual property litigation that we believe, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations, we cannot predict the outcome of any pending litigation and an unfavorable outcome could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. 14 Risks Relating to Our Regulatory, Accounting, Legal, and Tax Environment International tariffs could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Changes in laws and policies governing foreign trade could adversely affect our business. The institution of global trade tariffs, trade sanctions, new or onerous trade restrictions, embargoes and other stringent government controls carries the risk of negatively affecting global economic conditions, which could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations. Also, certain foreign governments have imposed tariffs on certain U.S. goods and may take additional retaliatory trade actions stemming from the tariffs, which could increase the pricing of our products and result in decreased consumer demand for our products outside of the United States, which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, U.S. initiated tariffs on certain foreign goods, including raw materials, commodities, and products manufactured outside the United States that are used in our manufacturing processes may cause our manufacturing cost to rise, which would have a negative impact on our business and results of operations. An impairment in the carrying value of goodwill, trade names, and other long-lived assets could negatively affect our consolidated results of operations and net worth. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as our trade names, are recorded at fair value at the time of acquisition and are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. In evaluating the potential for impairment of goodwill and trade names, we make assumptions regarding future operating performance, business trends, and market and economic conditions. Such analyses further require us to make certain assumptions about sales, operating margins, growth rates, and discount rates. Uncertainties are inherent in evaluating and applying these factors to the assessment of goodwill and trade name recoverability. We could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill or trade names prior to the annual assessment if we experience business disruptions, unexpected significant declines in operating results, a divestiture of a significant component of our business, or declines in market capitalization. We also continually evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful lives of our definite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets may warrant revision or whether the remaining balance of such assets may not be recoverable. We use an estimate of the related undiscounted cash flow over the remaining life of the asset in measuring whether the asset is recoverable. As of June 30, 2021, the balance of total goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets was $64 million, which represents approximately 23 percent of total assets. If the future operating performance of either the Company or individual operating segments is not sufficient, we could be required to record non-cash impairment charges. Impairment charges could substantially affect our reported earnings in the periods such charges are recorded. In addition, impairment charges could indicate a reduction in business value which could limit our ability to obtain adequate financing in the future. Compliance with environmental, health, safety, and other regulatory requirements may increase costs and reduce demand for our products. We are subject to federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations, including those concerning product safety, environmental protection, and occupational health and safety. Some of these laws and regulations require us to obtain permits and limit our ability to discharge hazardous materials into the environment. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in the assessment of fines and penalties, obligations to conduct remedial or corrective actions, or, in extreme circumstances, revocation of our permits or injunctions preventing some or all of our operations. In addition, the components of our boats must meet certain regulatory standards, including stringent air emission standards for boat engines. Failure to meet these standards could result in an inability to sell our boats in key markets, which would adversely affect our business. Moreover, compliance with these regulatory requirements could increase the cost of our products, which in turn, may reduce consumer demand. While we believe that we are in compliance with applicable federal, state, local, and foreign regulatory requirements, and hold all licenses and permits required thereunder, we cannot provide assurance that we will, at all times, be able to continue to comply with applicable regulatory requirements. Compliance with increasingly stringent regulatory and permit requirements may, in the future, cause us to incur substantial capital costs and increase our cost of operations, or may limit our operations, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition. Our manufacturing processes involve the use, handling, storage, and contracting for recycling or disposal of hazardous substances and wastes. The failure to manage or dispose of such hazardous substances and wastes properly could expose us to material liability or fines, including liability for personal injury or property damage due to exposure to hazardous substances, damages to natural resources, or for the investigation and remediation of environmental conditions. Under environmental laws, we may be liable for 15 remediation of contamination at sites where our hazardous wastes have been disposed or at our current or former facilities, regardless of whether such facilities are owned or leased or regardless of whether we were at fault. While we do not believe that we are presently subject to any such liabilities, we cannot assure you that environmental conditions relating to our prior, existing, or future sites or operations or those of predecessor companies will not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition. Additionally, we are subject to laws governing our relationships with employees, including, but not limited to, employment obligations and employee wage, hour, and benefits issues, such as health care benefits. Compliance with these rules and regulations, and compliance with any changes to current regulations, could increase the cost of our operations. We manufacture and sell products that create exposure to potential claims and litigation. Our manufacturing operations and the products we produce could result in product quality, warranty, personal injury, property damage, and other issues, thereby increasing the risk of litigation and potential liability, as well as regulatory fines. We have in the past incurred such liabilities and may in the future be exposed to liability for such claims. We maintain product and general liability insurance of the types and in the amounts that we believe are customary for the industry. However, we may experience material losses in the future, incur significant costs to defend claims or issue product recalls, experience claims in excess of our insurance coverage or that are not covered by insurance, or be subjected to fines or penalties. Our reputation may be adversely affected by such claims, whether or not successful, including potential negative publicity about our products. In addition, if any of our products are, or are alleged to be, defective, we may be required to participate in a recall of that product if the defect or alleged defect relates to safety. These and other claims we may face could be costly to us and require substantial management attention. The nature of our business exposes us to workers’ compensation claims and other workplace liabilities. Certain materials we use require our employees to handle potentially hazardous or toxic substances. While our employees who handle these and other potentially hazardous or toxic materials receive specialized training and wear protective clothing, there is still a risk that they, or others, may be exposed to these substances. Exposure to these substances could result in significant injury to our employees and damage to our property or the property of others, including natural resource damage. Our personnel are also at risk for other workplace- related injuries, including slips and falls. We have in the past been, and may in the future be, subject to fines, penalties, and other liabilities in connection with any such injury or damage. Although we currently maintain what we believe to be suitable and adequate insurance in excess of our self-insured amounts, we may be unable to maintain such insurance on acceptable terms or such insurance may not provide adequate protection against potential liabilities. Increases in income tax rates or changes in income tax laws or enforcement could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. Changes in domestic and international tax legislation could expose us to additional tax liability. Although we monitor changes in tax laws and work to mitigate the impact of proposed changes, such changes may negatively impact our financial results. In addition, increases in individual income tax rates would negatively affect our potential consumers’ discretionary income and could decrease the demand for our products. Risks Relating to Ownership of our Common Stock The timing and amount of our stock repurchases are subject to a number of uncertainties. Our board of directors has authorized the Company’s discretionary repurchase of outstanding common stock, to be systematically completed in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. The amount and timing of share repurchases are based on a variety of factors. Important considerations that could cause us to limit, suspend, or delay future stock repurchases include: • unfavorable market and economic conditions; • the trading price of our common stock; • the nature and magnitude of other investment opportunities available to us from time to time; and • the availability of cash. Delaying, limiting, or suspending our stock repurchase program may negatively affect performance versus earnings per share targets, and ultimately our stock price. Shareholders may be diluted by future issuances of common stock in connection with our incentive plans, acquisitions, or otherwise; future sales of such shares in the public market, or the expectations that such sales may occur, could lower our stock price. 16 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue shares of common stock and options, rights, warrants, and appreciation rights relating to common stock for the consideration and on the terms and conditions established by our board of directors in its sole discretion, whether in connection with acquisitions or otherwise. Any common stock that we issue, including under our 2015 Incentive Award Plan or other equity incentive plans that we may adopt in the future, would dilute the percentage ownership of holders of our common stock. We do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. While we have paid dividends in the past, we presently have no intention to pay dividends on our common stock at any time in the foreseeable future. Any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. Furthermore, our ability to declare and pay dividends may be limited by instruments governing future outstanding indebtedness we may incur. Delaware law and certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may prevent efforts by our stockholders to change the direction or management of our Company. We are a Delaware corporation, and the anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated by-laws currently contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult without the approval of our board of directors, including, but not limited to, the following: • our board of directors will be classified into three classes until our 2022 annual meeting of stockholders; • only our board of directors may call special meetings of our stockholders; and • we require advance notice and duration of ownership requirements for stockholder proposals. These provisions could discourage, delay, or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and cause us to take other corporate actions they desire. In addition, because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions could in turn affect any attempt by our stockholders to replace current members of our management team. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS. None. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES. As of June 30, 2021, all our MasterCraft boats are manufactured and lake-tested at our 250,000-square-foot manufacturing facility located on approximately 60 acres of lakefront land in Vonore, Tennessee.

Market Information Our common stock has been publicly traded on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol “MCFT” since July 17, 2015. Prior to that time, there was no public market for our common stock. As of August 30, 2021, we had approximately 7,500 holders of record of our common stock. Dividends We presently do not anticipate declaring or paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Any future determination as to the declaration and payment of dividends, will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on then-existing conditions, including our operating results, financial condition, contractual restrictions, capital requirements, business prospects, and other factors our board of directors may deem relevant. See Item 1A “Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Ownership of Our Common Stock.” Stock Repurchase Plan On June 24, 2021, the board of directors authorized a stock repurchase plan that allows for the repurchase of up to $50.0 million of our common stock during the three-year period ending June 24, 2024. The timing and amount of any stock repurchases will be determined by management at its discretion based on ongoing assessments of the capital needs of the business, the market price of our common stock and general market conditions. Stock repurchases under the program may be made through a variety of methods, which may include open market purchases, accelerated share repurchases, tender offers, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise The repurchase plan may be reviewed, modified, suspended or terminated by our board of directors at any time as it deems necessary in its sole discretion. We did not repurchase any common stock during fiscal 2021. Stock Performance Graph This performance graph shall not be deemed “soliciting material” or to be “filed” with the SEC for purposes of Section 18 of the Exchange Act of 1934, or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that section, and shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any filing of ours under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act. The following stock performance graph illustrates the cumulative total shareholder return on our common stock for the period from June 30, 2016 to June 30, 2021, as compared to the Russell 2000 Index and the Dow Jones US Recreational Products Index. The comparison assumes (i) a hypothetical investment of $100 in our common stock and the two above mentioned indices on June 30, 2016 and (ii) the full reinvestment of all dividends. The comparisons in the graph are not intended to be indicative of possible future performance of our common stock. 18 Securities Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans For information regarding securities authorized for issuance under our equity compensation plans, see Note 10—Share-Based Compensation in Item 8 and Item 12: Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters.

( 2 ) During fiscal 2019 the Company acquired Crest, as described in Note 3 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. During fiscal 2018, the Company acquired NauticStar. ( 3 ) Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA margin are non-GAAP financial measures. For definitions of our non-GAAP measures and a reconciliation of each to net income (loss) for the years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, see Item 7 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 20 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. The following discussion and analysis should be read together with the sections entitled “Risk Factors,” “Selected Financial Data,” and the financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. In addition, the statements in this discussion and analysis regarding industry outlook, our expectations regarding the performance of our business, anticipated financial results, liquidity and the other non-historical statements are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described in “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and in “Risk Factors” above. Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements. This section generally discusses 2021 and 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020. Discussions of 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019 are not included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and can be found in Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2020 , which was filed with the SEC on September 11, 2020. Key Performance Measures From time to time we use certain key performance measures in evaluating our business and results of operations and we may refer to one or more of these key performance measures in this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” These key performance measures include: • Unit sales volume — We define unit sales volume as the number of our boats sold to our dealers during a period. • Net sales per unit — We define net sales per unit as net sales divided by unit sales volume. • Gross margin — We define gross margin as gross profit divided by net sales, expressed as a percentage. • Net income margin — We define net income (loss) margin as net income divided by net sales, expressed as a percentage. • Adjusted EBITDA — We define Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization (“EBITDA”), as further adjusted to eliminate certain non-cash charges and unusual items that we do not consider to be indicative of our core/ongoing operations. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss), see “Non-GAAP Measures” below. • Adjusted EBITDA margin — We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by net sales, expressed as a percentage. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA margin to net income margin, see “Non-GAAP Measures” below. • Adjusted Net Income — We define Adjusted Net Income as net income (loss) adjusted to eliminate certain non-cash charges and other items that we do not consider to be indicative of our core/ongoing operations and adjusted for the impact to income tax expense (benefit) related to non-GAAP adjustments. For a reconciliation of Adjusted Net Income to net income (loss), see “Non-GAAP Measures” below. COVID-19 Pandemic Though the Company has been impacted by supply chain disruptions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, demand for our products has been strong and, as a result of our employees’ committed efforts, our facilities are now running at production rates above their pre-COVID-19 levels. However, we continue to be subject to risks and uncertainties as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business remains uncertain and difficult to predict, as the response to the COVID-19 pandemic is still evolving in many countries, including the United States and other markets where we and our suppliers operate. Impact to Operations To balance wholesale production with the then anticipated impacts to retail demand caused by the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, we reduced production in February 2020, and, in late March 2020, temporarily suspended manufacturing operations at all of our facilities to protect the health of our employees and comply with governmental mandates. We resumed operations at reduced production levels at our manufacturing facilities by mid-May 2020. As governmental restrictions were lifted and as a result of social distancing abilities, demand in the U.S. retail marine market accelerated in May 2020, and has remained elevated, driving dealer inventory levels to historic lows, which remain at depressed levels despite our increased production rates being above pre-COVID-19 levels. Additionally, the Company’s operations have been impacted by supply chain disruptions. To reduce the impact of supply chain disruptions on production, the Company has increased its safety stock. 21 Impact to Liquidity and Capital Resources On March 19, 2020, we drew $35.0 million on our revolving credit agreement as a precautionary measure in order to increase our cash position and preserve financial flexibility in light of uncertainty in the global markets resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, on May 7, 2020, we entered into Amendment No. 3 (the “Amendment”) to the Fourth Amended & Restated Credit and Guarantee Agreement to strengthen our financial flexibility. Among other things, the changes effected by the Amendment provided temporary relief under our financial covenants. See Note 8 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding these changes, including sunsetting of the temporary relief provisions. The performance of the business and our cash management activities provided the flexibility to repay the entire $35.0 million revolving credit facility during the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Since that time, our strong operating performance has continued which has allowed us to refinance our debt and build our cash balance to $39.3 million as of June 30, 2021. The refinancing allowed us to reduce our borrowing under our term loan by $33.7 million by drawing that same amount on our revolving credit agreement, which leaves us with $66.3 million of availability under the revolving credit agreement as of June 30, 2021. These actions provide us with the flexibility to expedite principal payments on total debt. We were in compliance with our financial covenants as of June 30, 2021. Outlook We believe strong marine retail demand coupled with abnormally low dealer inventory levels for all our brands has created a growth opportunity, and as a result, we plan to further increase production rates, which are already above their pre-COVID-19 levels. However, as we navigate the unprecedented confluence of demand and disruption precipitated by the COVID-19 pandemic, our production rates going forward will depend, in large part, on our suppliers’ capacity and ability to remain open if infection rates increase. Additionally, demand for raw materials and components used in the production of our products has surged. As a result, some of the materials and components that we use, including certain resins, fiberglass, aluminum, lumber and steel, are in short supply. Our ability to grow also requires our Company to retain a high-performing workforce which will be critical to meeting our production objectives. We will continue to actively monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and may take further actions to alter business operations as may be required by government authorities, or that are determined to be in the best interest of our employees, dealers, suppliers, and stakeholders. The full extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, operations, and financial results will depend on evolving factors that we cannot predict. See Item 1A “Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Business — Actual or potential public health emergencies, epidemics, or pandemics, such as the current coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.” Overview of Results of Operations Net sales were $525.8 million for fiscal 2021, an increase of 44.8 percent from fiscal 2020, which was impacted by, among other things, the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase was primarily the result of higher sales volumes, higher prices, and lower dealer incentives, partially offset by the impact of model mix. Gross margin increased 390 basis points to 24.7 percent from fiscal 2020, primarily due to higher prices, higher sales volume, and lower dealer incentives. The increase was partially offset by costs associated with the transition of production of our Aviara brand to the Merritt Island, Florida facility and increased labor and material costs. Net income was $56.2 million for fiscal 2021, compared to Net loss of $24.0 million for fiscal 2020. Diluted net income per share was $2.96, compared to Diluted net loss per share of $1.28 for fiscal 2020. Net loss for fiscal 2020 included Goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges of $56.4 million, or $(3.01) per diluted share. Merritt Island Facility and Aviara Transition On October 26, 2020, we completed the purchase of certain real property located in Merritt Island, Florida, including an approximately 140,000-square-foot boat manufacturing facility, (the “Merritt Island Facility”) for a purchase price of $14.2 million. We expanded our overall boat building capacity by moving all Aviara production to the Merritt Island Facility. While we believe this additional capacity will help facilitate Aviara’s long-term growth, importantly, relocating Aviara production from our Vonore, Tennessee facility provided for an immediate increase in capacity and productivity for our MasterCraft brand. We began producing Aviara in the Merritt Island Facility in December and shipments from the new facility commenced in the third quarter of fiscal 2021. 22 Results of Operations The consolidated statements of operations presented below should be read together with “Selected Consolidated Financial Data,” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. We derived the consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 from our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected in the future. 2021 vs. 2020 2021 2020 Change % Change (Dollars in thousands) Consolidated statements of operations : NET SALES $ 525,808 $ 363,073 $ 162,735 44.8 % COST OF SALES 395,837 287,717 108,120 37.6 % GROSS PROFIT 129,971 75,356 54,615 72.5 % OPERATING EXPENSES: Selling and marketing 13,021 15,981 (2,960 ) (18.5 %) General and administrative 37,049 25,557 11,492 45.0 % Amortization of other intangible assets 3,948 3,948 - 0.0 % Goodwill and other intangible asset impairment — 56,437 (56,437 ) (100.0 %) Total operating expenses 54,018 101,923 (47,905 ) (47.0 %) OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) 75,953 (26,567 ) 102,520 385.9 % OTHER EXPENSE: Interest expense 3,392 5,045 (1,653 ) 14.5 % Loss on extinguishment of debt 733 — 733 0.0 % INCOME (LOSS) BEFORE INCOME TAX EXPENSE 71,828 (31,612 ) 103,440 327.2 % INCOME TAX EXPENSE (BENEFIT) 15,658 (7,565 ) 23,223 (307.0 %) NET INCOME (LOSS) $ 56,170 $ (24,047 ) $ 80,217 333.6 % Additional financial and other data: Unit sales volume: MasterCraft 3,343 2,478 865 34.9 % NauticStar 1,387 1,191 196 16.5 % Crest 2,467 1,623 844 52.0 % Consolidated unit sales volume 7,197 5,292 1,905 36.0 % Net sales: MasterCraft $ 363,274 $ 246,455 $ 116,819 47.4 % NauticStar 59,846 54,930 4,916 8.9 % Crest 102,688 61,688 41,000 66.5 % Consolidated net sales $ 525,808 $ 363,073 $ 162,735 44.8 % Net sales per unit: MasterCraft $ 109 $ 99 $ 10 10.1 % NauticStar 43 46 (3 ) (6.5 %) Crest 42 38 4 10.5 % Consolidated net sales per unit 73 69 4 5.8 % Gross margin 24.7 % 20.8 % 390 bpts Fiscal 2021 Compared to Fiscal 2020 Net Sales . Net Sales for fiscal 2021 were $525.8 million, an increase of $162.7 million, or 44.8 percent, compared to $363.1 million for fiscal 2020. The increase was primarily due to: • A $116.8 million increase for the MasterCraft segment driven by a 47.4 percent increase in sales volumes, a favorable mix of higher priced and higher contented models, lower dealer incentives, and higher part sales volume, • a $41.0 million increase for the Crest segment resulting from a 66.5 percent increase in sales volume, lower dealer incentives, higher prices, and option favorability, and • a $4.9 million increase for the NauticStar segment, primarily due to higher sales volumes and higher prices, partially offset by unfavorable product mix. Gross Profit and Gross Margin. Gross profit increased $54.6 million, or 72.5 percent, to $130.0 million compared to $75.4 million for the prior year. Gross margin increased 390 basis points to 24.7 percent in fiscal 2021 from 20.8 percent in fiscal 2020. The 23 increase was primarily due to higher prices, higher sales volume and lower dealer incentives. The increase was partially offset by costs to transition production of our Aviara brand to the Merritt Island, Florida facility and increased labor and material costs. Operating Expenses . Operating expenses decreased $47.9 million, or 47.0 percent, to $54.0 million for fiscal 2021 compared to $101.9 million for fiscal 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by $56.4 million of goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges related to our NauticStar and Crest segments recorded in fiscal 2020. There were no impairment charges in fiscal 2021. See Note 6 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the impairment charges. In addition, the Company had lower selling and marketing costs in fiscal 2021 primarily due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. The decrease was partially offset by higher general and administrative expenses resulting from higher incentive compensation costs and additional investments related to product development and information technology. Interest Expense . Interest expense decreased $1.7 million, or 14.5 percent, primarily driven by lower effective interest rates and lower average outstanding debt balances during fiscal 2021. Loss on Extinguishment of Debt . Loss on extinguishment of debt totaling $0.7 million was recognized upon refinancing the Company’s debt in fiscal 2021. The loss is comprised of unamortized debt issuance costs related to the previously existing credit facility. See Note 8 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the Company’s debt refinancing. Income Tax Expense (Benefit) . Our consolidated effective income tax rate decreased to 21.8 percent for fiscal 2021 from 23.9 percent for fiscal 2020. See Note 9 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. 24 Non-GAAP Measures EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin We define EBITDA as earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA further adjusted to eliminate certain non-cash charges or other items that we do not consider to be indicative of our core and/or ongoing operations. For the periods presented herein, these adjustments include Aviara transition costs, debt refinancing charges, goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges, Aviara (new brand) startup costs, COVID-19 shutdown costs, transaction expenses associated with an acquisition and certain non-cash items including share-based compensation and acquisition-related inventory step-up adjustments. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA expressed as a percentage of Net sales. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income Per Share We define Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share as net income (loss) adjusted to eliminate certain non-cash charges or other items that we do not consider to be indicative of our core and/or ongoing operations and adjusted for the impact to income tax expense (benefit) related to non-GAAP adjustments. For the periods presented herein, these adjustments include Aviara transition costs, debt refinancing charges, goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges, Aviara (new brand) startup costs, COVID-19 shutdown costs, transaction expenses associated with an acquisition, and certain non-cash items including other intangible asset amortization, share-based compensation, and an acquisition-related inventory step-up adjustment. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted Net Income per share, which we refer to collectively as the Non-GAAP Measures, are not measures of net income (loss) or operating income (loss) as determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. The Non-GAAP Measures are not measures of performance in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss), net income (loss) per share, or operating cash flows determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of cash flow. We believe that the inclusion of the Non-GAAP Measures is appropriate to provide additional information to investors because securities analysts and investors use the Non-GAAP Measures to assess our operating performance across periods on a consistent basis and to evaluate the relative risk of an investment in our securities. We use Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share to facilitate a comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis from period to period that, when viewed in combination with our results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than does U.S. GAAP measures alone. We believe Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share assists our board of directors, management, investors, and other users of the financial statements in comparing our net income (loss) on a consistent basis from period to period because it removes certain non-cash items and other items that we do not consider to be indicative of our core and/or ongoing operations and adjusts for the impact to income tax expense (benefit) related to non-GAAP adjustments. The Non-GAAP Measures have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are: • Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; • Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; • Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; • Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our tax expense or any cash requirements to pay income taxes; • Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest payments on our indebtedness; and • Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Net Income per share, and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters we do not consider to be indicative of our core and/or ongoing operations, but may nonetheless have a material impact on our results of operations. In addition, because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of the Non-GAAP Measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, including companies in our industry. 25 The following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss) as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, and net income margin (expressed as a percentage of net sales) to Adjusted EBITDA margin (expressed as a percentage of net sales) for the periods indicated: (Dollars in thousands) 2021 % of Net sales 2020 % of Net sales 2019 % of Net sales Net income (loss) $ 56,170 10.7 % $ (24,047 ) -6.6 % $ 21,354 4.6 % Income tax expense (benefit) 15,658 (7,565 ) 5,392 Interest expense 3,392 5,045 6,513 Depreciation and amortization 11,630 10,527 7,787 EBITDA 86,850 16.5 % (16,040 ) -4.4 % 41,046 8.8 % Share-based compensation 2,984 1,061 1,678 Aviara transition costs (a) 2,150 — — Debt refinancing charges (b) 769 — — Goodwill and other intangible asset impairment (c) — 56,437 31,000 Aviara start-up costs (d) — 1,446 2,840 COVID-19 shutdown costs (e) — 1,394 — Transaction expense (f) — — 2,377 Inventory step-up adjustment - acquisition related (g) — — 382 Adjusted EBITDA $ 92,753 17.6 % $ 44,298 12.2 % $ 79,323 17.0 % (a) Represents costs to transition production of the Aviara brand from Vonore, Tennessee to Merritt Island, Florida.

We expect to begin selling one additional model, the AV40, in fiscal 2022. Start-up costs presented for fiscal 2020 are related to the AV36 and AV40 models. Start-up costs presented for fiscal 2019 are related to the launch of the Aviara brand and the three initial Aviara models which had not yet begun selling.

Change in Non-GAAP Financial Measure Prior to fiscal year 2020, the Company’s calculation of a diluted per share amount of Adjusted Net Income included an adjustment to fully dilute this non-GAAP measure for all outstanding share-based compensation grants. This additional dilution was incorporated by adjusting the GAAP measure, Weighted Average Shares Used for the Computation of Basic earnings (loss) per share, as presented on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, to include a dilutive effect for all outstanding restricted stock awards, performance stock units, and stock options. Beginning with the fiscal year 2020 presentation, the Company no longer includes this additional dilution impact in its calculation of Adjusted Net Income per diluted share. The Company has instead utilized the Weighted Average Shares Used for the Computation of Basic and Diluted earnings (loss) per share as presented on the Consolidated Statements of Operations to calculate Adjusted Net Income per diluted share for all periods presented herein. The Company believes that, because its outstanding share-based compensation grants no longer result in a material amount of dilution of its earnings as was the case nearer to the date of our IPO, the adjustment methodology previously used no longer provides meaningful information to management or other users of its financial statements. This change resulted in an increase of $0.02 in the year ended June 30, 2020 in the amount of Adjusted Net Income per diluted share from what would have been reported using the previous methodology. The change also resulted in an increase of $0.01 for the year ended June 30, 2019 in the amount of Adjusted Net Income per diluted share from what was previously reported. In addition, the fiscal 2019 amount for Transaction expense, in the reconciliation of net income (loss) per diluted share to Adjusted net income per diluted share, decreased by $0.01 from what was previously reported as a result of a change in the presentation of the impact of rounding. 28 Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary liquidity and capital resource needs are to finance working capital, fund capital expenditures, service our debt, and fund our stock repurchase program. Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash balance, cash generated from operating activities, our revolving credit agreement and the refinancing and/or new issuance of long-term debt. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $39.3 million as of June 30, 2021, an increase of $23.0 million from $16.3 million as of June 30, 2020. Total debt as of June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020 was $93.1 million and $108.6 million, respectively. On June 28, 2021, we refinanced our debt and entered into a new credit agreement increasing the capacity under our revolving credit facility from $35.0 million to $100.0 million. As of June 30, 2021, we had $33.7 million outstanding under the facility, leaving $66.3 million of available borrowing capacity. Refer to Note 8 – Long-term Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. We believe our cash balance, cash from operations, and our ability to borrow, will be sufficient to provide for our liquidity and capital resource needs, including authorized stock repurchases. The following table summarizes the cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities: (Dollars in thousands) 2021 2020 2019 Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 68,538 $ 30,198 $ 55,886 Investing activities (27,832 ) (14,218 ) (95,786 ) Financing activities (17,773 ) (5,487 ) 37,817 Net change in cash $ 22,933 $ 10,493 $ (2,083 ) Fiscal 2021 Cash Flow Net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2021 totaled $68.5 million versus $30.2 million in fiscal 2020. The increase is primarily due to higher net earnings, net of non-cash items, partially offset by changes in working capital that were affected by production ramp-up activities as we experienced an increase in retail demand. Working capital is defined as Accounts receivable, Income tax receivable, Inventories, and Prepaid expenses and other current assets net of Accounts payable, Income tax payable, and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities as presented in the consolidated balance sheets, excluding the impact of acquisitions and non-cash adjustments. Accounts receivable increased $5.9 million primarily due to increased sales across all segments. Inventory increased $28.6 million, driven by increases to support higher production volumes and to increase safety stock to manage supply chain risk. Accounts payable increased $13.4 million primarily due to timing of payments and higher production activities. Accrued expenses and other current liabilities increased $12.2 million primarily driven by share-based compensation related to higher net earnings and higher warranty reserves for the increased sales volumes. Net cash used for investing activities was $27.8 million, which primarily included capital expenditures. Our capital spending was focused on expanding our capacity by purchasing the Merritt Island Facility for $14.2 million, capital related to the Aviara transition to the Merritt Island Facility, and maintenance capital. Net cash used for financing activities was $17.8 million and primarily related to net payments of long-term debt. Fiscal 2020 Cash Flow In fiscal 2020, net cash provided by operating activities totaled $30.2 million versus $55.9 million in fiscal 2019. This comparison reflects the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic where production was reduced, and temporarily suspended from late March to mid-May 2020. Accounts receivable decreased $6.3 million primarily due to reduced sales. Inventory decreased $4.8 million driven by lower production activities. Accounts payable decreased $6.9 million due to timing of payments and lower production activities. Accrued expenses and other current liabilities decreased $5.6 million driven by reduced dealer incentives and share-based compensation related to lower sales and financial results. Net cash used for investing activities was $14.2 million, which primarily included capital expenditures. Our capital spending was focused on maintenance capital and purchasing the previously leased Crest Facility. Refer to Note 11 – Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. 29 Net cash used for financing activities was $5.5 million and primarily related to net payments of long-term debt . Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company did not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements as of June 30, 2021. Contractual Obligations As of June 30, 2021, the Company’s contractual cash obligations were as follows: Payments Due by Period Less than More than (Dollars in thousands) Total 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years 5 years Long-Term Debt Obligations (1) $ 93,728 $ 3,000 $ 7,500 $ 83,228 $ — Interest on Long-Term Debt Obligations (2) 6,252 1,350 2,570 2,332 — Operating Lease Obligations 591 228 105 33 225 Purchase Obligations (3) 64,416 17,027 31,457 15,932 — Other 370 346 24 — — Total Contractual Obligations (4) $ 165,357 $ 21,951 $ 41,656 $ 101,525 $ 225 (1) See Note 8 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Company's debt. “Long-Term Debt Obligations” refers to future cash principal payments. (2) Interest payments on variable rate debt instruments were calculated using June 30, 2021 interest rates and holding them constant for the life of the instruments. (3) Purchase obligations represent agreements with suppliers and vendors entered into as part of the normal course of business, including engine purchase commitments. (4) Unrecognized tax benefits of $3.8 million are not reflected in this table because the Company cannot predict when open income tax years will close with completed examinations. See Note 9 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Repurchase Obligations — The Company has reserves to cover potential losses associated with repurchase obligations based on historical experience and current facts and circumstances. We incurred no material impact from repurchase events during fiscal 2021, 2020, or 2019. An adverse change in retail sales, however, could require us to repurchase boats repossessed by floor plan financing companies upon an event of default by any of our dealers, subject in some cases to an annual limitation. See Note 11 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for more information related to our obligations under floor plan financing agreements. Critical Accounting Policies A “critical accounting policy” is one which is both important to the understanding of our financial condition and results of operations and requires management’s most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results could differ from those estimates and cause our reported net income (loss) to vary significantly from period to period. We believe that the policies listed below involve the greatest degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, we believe these are the most critical to understand in order to evaluate fully our financial condition and results of operations. For additional information regarding these policies, see Note 1 — Significant Accounting Policies in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets — The Company does not amortize goodwill and other purchased intangible assets with indefinite lives. The Company’s intangible assets with finite lives consist primarily of dealer networks and are carried at their estimated fair values at the time of acquisition, less accumulated amortization. Goodwill The Company reviews goodwill for impairment at its annual impairment testing date, which is June 30, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit may be below its carrying value. As part of the annual test, the Company may perform a qualitative, rather than quantitative, assessment to determine whether the fair values of its reporting units are “more likely than not” to be greater than their carrying values. In performing this qualitative analysis, the Company considers various factors, including the effect of market or industry changes and the reporting units' actual results compared to projected results. 30 If the fair value of a reporting unit does not meet the ""more likely than not"" criteria discussed above, the impairment test for goodwill is a quantitative test. This test involves comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, goodwill is not considered impaired. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value then the goodwill is considered impaired and an impairment loss is recognized in an amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of the goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The Company calculates the fair value of its reporting units considering both the income approach and market approach. The income approach calculates the fair value of the reporting unit using a discounted cash flow approach. Internally forecasted future cash flows, which the Company believes reasonably approximate market participant assumptions, are discounted using a weighted average cost of capital (“Discount Rate”) developed for each reporting unit. The Discount Rate is developed using market observable inputs, as well as considering whether or not there is a measure of risk related to the specific reporting unit’s forecasted performance. Fair value under the market approach is determined for each unit by applying market multiples for comparable public companies to the unit’s financial results. The key judgements in these calculations are the assumptions used in determining the reporting unit’s forecasted future performance, including revenue growth and operating margins, as well as the perceived risk associated with those forecasts in determining the Discount Rate, along with selecting representative market multiples. As of June 30, 2021, only the Mastercraft reporting unit has a goodwill balance. The fair value of this reporting unit substantially exceeds its carrying value. However, it is possible that the Company’s assumptions regarding the key judgements in this fair value calculation could change in the future. If actual results differ from the Company’s assumptions, it is possible that the MasterCraft reporting unit could incur goodwill impairment charges in future periods. Other Intangible Assets The Company's primary intangible assets other than goodwill are dealer networks and trade names acquired in business combinations. These intangible assets are initially valued using a methodology commensurate with the intended use of the asset. The dealer networks were valued using an income approach, which requires an estimate or forecast of the expected future cash flows from the dealer network through the application of the multi-period excess earnings approach. The fair value of trade names is measured using a relief-from-royalty approach, a variation of the income approach, which requires an estimate or forecast of the expected future cash flows. This method assumes the value of the trade name is the discounted cash flows of the amount that would be paid to third parties had the Company not owned the trade name and instead licensed the trade name from another company. The basis for future sales projections for these methods are based on internal revenue forecasts by reporting unit, which the Company believes represent reasonable market participant assumptions. The future cash flows are discounted using an applicable Discount Rate as well as any potential risk premium to reflect the inherent risk of holding a standalone intangible asset. The key judgements in these fair value calculations, as applicable, are: assumptions used in developing internal revenue growth and dealer expense forecasts, assumed dealer attrition rates, the selection of an appropriate royalty rate, as well as the perceived risk associated with those forecasts in determining the Discount Rate. The costs of amortizable intangible assets, including dealer networks, are recognized over their expected useful lives, approximately ten years for the dealer networks, using the straight-line method. Intangible assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment using a process similar to that used to evaluate long-lived assets. Intangible assets not subject to amortization are assessed for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that an asset may be impaired. As part of the annual test, the Company may perform a qualitative, rather than quantitative, assessment to determine whether each trade name intangible asset is “more likely than not” impaired. In performing this qualitative analysis, the Company considers various factors, including macroeconomic events, industry and market events and cost related events. If the “more likely than not” criteria is not met, the impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset. During fiscal 2020, impairment charges were incurred for the NauticStar and Crest trade name-related intangible asset, as well as during fiscal 2019 for the NauticStar trade name-related intangible asset. As of fiscal year-end 2021, which is our annual impairment testing date under ASC 350, there were favorable changes in circumstances as compared to those existing in fiscal 2020, such as strong marine retail demand coupled with record low retail inventory levels that have created a growth opportunity, which we believe indicates that it is not more likely than not that the current carrying values of these assets are higher than the fair values. Changes in assumptions and estimates such as declines in projected results, however, may affect the fair value of these intangible assets and could result in additional impairment charges in future periods. Product Warranties — The Company offers warranties on the sale of certain products for periods of between one and five years. These warranties require us or our dealers to repair or replace defective products during the warranty period at no cost to the 31 consumer. We estimate the costs that may be incurred under our basic limited warranty and record as a liability the amount of such costs at the time the product revenue is recognized. The key judgements that affect our estimate for warranty liability include the number of units sold, historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims and cost per claim. We periodically assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as actual claims are determined or as changes in the obligations become reasonably estimable. We also adjust our liability for specific warranty matters when they become known and exposure can be estimated. Future warranty claims may differ from our estimate of the warranty liability, which could lead to changes in the Company’s warranty liability in future periods. Income Taxes— We are subject to income taxes in the United States of America and the United Kingdom. Our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rates, primarily due to changes in the valuation allowance and non-deductible expenses, as further described in Note 9 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, we cannot provide assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest. Significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. In the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. Realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income in future periods. If future events cause us to conclude that it is not more likely than not that we will be able to recover the value of our deferred tax assets, we are required to establish a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets at that time. Revenue Recognition — The Company’s revenue is derived primarily from the sale of boats and trailers, marine parts, and accessories to its independent dealers. The Company recognizes revenue when obligations under the terms of a contract are satisfied and control over promised goods is transferred to a customer. For the majority of sales, this occurs when the product is released to the carrier responsible for transporting it to a customer. The Company typically receives payment within 5 business days of shipment. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration it expects to receive in exchange for a product. The Company offers dealer incentives that include wholesale rebates, retail rebates and promotions, floor plan reimbursement or cash discounts, and other allowances that are recorded as reductions of revenues in Net sales in the consolidated statements of operations. The consideration recognized represents the amount specified in a contract with a customer, net of estimated incentives the Company reasonably expects to pay. The estimated liability and reduction in revenue for dealer incentives is recorded at the time of sale. Subsequent adjustments to incentive estimates are possible because actual results may differ from these estimates if conditions dictate the need to enhance or reduce sales promotion and incentive programs or if dealer achievement or other items vary from historical trends. Accrued dealer incentives are included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Rebates and Discounts Dealers earn wholesale rebates based on purchase volume commitments and achievement of certain performance metrics. The Company estimates the amount of wholesale rebates based on historical achievement, forecasted volume, and assumptions regarding dealer behavior. Rebates that apply to boats already in dealer inventory are referred to as retail rebates. The Company estimates the amount of retail rebates based on historical data for specific boat models adjusted for forecasted sales volume, product mix, dealer and consumer behavior, and assumptions concerning market conditions. The Company also utilizes various programs whereby it offers cash discounts or agrees to reimburse its dealers for certain floor plan interest costs incurred by dealers for limited periods of time, generally ranging up to nine months. Other Revenue Recognition Matters Dealers generally have no right to return unsold boats. Occasionally, the Company may accept returns in limited circumstances and at the Company’s discretion under its warranty policy. The Company may be obligated, in the event of default by a dealer, to accept returns of unsold boats under its repurchase commitment to floor financing providers, who are able to obtain such boats through foreclosure. The repurchase commitment is on an individual unit basis with a term from the date it is financed by the lending 32 institution through the payment date by the dealer, generally not exceeding 30 months. The Company accounts for these arrangements as guarantees and recognizes a liability based on the estimated fair value of the repurchase obligation. The estimated fair value takes into account our estimate of the loss we will incur upon resale of any repurchases. The Company accrues the estimated fair value of this obligation based on the age of inventory currently under floor plan financing and estimated credit quality of dealers holding the inventory. Inputs used to estimate this fair value include significant unobservable inputs that reflect the Company’s assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use and, therefore, this liability is classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. We incurred no material impact from repurchase events during fiscal 2021, 2020, or 2019. See Note 11 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on repurchase obligations. New Accounting Pronouncements See “Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Significant Accounting Policies — New Accounting Pronouncements.” ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. Market risk represents the risk of changes in the value of market risk sensitive instruments caused by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, interest rates, and commodity prices. Changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in the results of our operations and cash flows. In the ordinary course of business, we are primarily exposed to interest rate risks. We rely on third parties to supply raw materials used in the manufacturing process, including resins, fiberglass, aluminum, lumber, and steel, as well as product parts and components. The prices for these raw materials, parts, and components fluctuate depending on market conditions and, in some instances, commodity prices or trade policies, including tariffs. Substantial increases in the prices of raw materials, parts, and components would increase our operating costs, and could reduce our profitability if we are unable to recoup the increased costs through higher product prices or improved operating efficiencies. As of June 30, 2021, we had $93.1 million of long-term debt outstanding, bearing interest at the effective interest rate of 1.38%. See Note 8 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding our long-term debt. A hypothetical 1% increase or decrease in interest rates would have resulted in a $0.6 million change to our interest expense for fiscal 2021. ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA. The financial statements and supplementary financial information required to be filed under this Item 8 are presented in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K. ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE. None. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) (of the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. As of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-K Annual Report, we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2021. 33 Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2021. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (""COSO"") in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) . Based on such assessment our management has concluded that, as of June 30, 2021, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2021, has been audited by our independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, as stated in their report which is included in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f), during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

LEEMPUTTE Director Peter G. Leemputte September 2, 2021 39 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of MasterCraft Boat Holdings, Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of MasterCraft Boat Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries (the ""Company"") as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash flows, for each of the two years in the period ended June 30, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the ""financial statements""). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended June 30, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated September 2, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Product Warranties — Refer to Notes 1 and 7 to the financial statements Critical Audit Matter Description The Company offers warranties on the sale of certain of its products for periods of between one and five years. Estimated costs that may be incurred under these warranties are accrued at the time the product revenue is recognized. These estimated costs are based upon the number of units sold, historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims, and the cost per claim. We identified the accrued warranty liability for the MasterCraft brand as a critical audit matter because of the significant judgments made by management to estimate the anticipated rates of warranty claims and cost per claim related to product warranties at the time the product revenue is recognized. This required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s estimates of the rates and costs of future warranty claims. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our audit procedures related to the accrued warranty liability for the MasterCraft brand included the following, among others: • We evaluated the design and operating effectiveness of controls over management’s estimation of the accrued warranty liability, including those over historical product warranty claim data and projected future product warranty claims. F-1 • We evaluated the accuracy and completeness of the historical product warranty claims as an input to management’s accrued warranty liability calculation. • We evaluated management’s ability to accurately estimate the accrued warranty liability by comparing the accrued warranty liability in the prior year to the actual product warranty claims paid in the current year. • We assessed management’s methodology and tested the valuation of the accrued warranty liability by developing an independent expectation for the accrual based on the historical amounts recorded as a percentage of sales and compared our expectation to the amounts recorded by management. • We further evaluated the completeness of the accrued warranty liability through inquiries of operational and executive management regarding knowledge of known product warranty claims or product issues and evaluated whether they were appropriately considered in the determination of the accrued warranty liability. /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP Nashville, Tennessee September 2, 2021 We have served as the Company's auditor since 2019. F-2 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of MasterCraft Boat Holdings, Inc. Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of MasterCraft Boat Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of June 30, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended June 30, 2021, of the Company and our report dated September 2, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP Nashville, Tennessee September 2, 2021 F-3 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM Board of Directors and Stockholders MasterCraft Boat Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements We have audited the consolidated balance sheet of MasterCraft Boat Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of June 30, 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the year ended June 30, 2019, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at June 30, 2019, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the year ended June 30, 2019, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. /s/ BDO USA, LLP Atlanta, Georgia September 13, 2019 F-4 MASTERCRAFT BOAT HOLDINGS, INC.

F-8 MASTERCRAFT BOAT HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unless otherwise noted, dollars in thousands, except per share data and per unit data) 1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Organization – MasterCraft Boat Holdings, Inc. (“Holdings”) was formed on January 28, 2000, as a Delaware holding company and operates primarily through its wholly owned subsidiaries, MasterCraft Boat Company, LLC; MasterCraft Services, LLC; MasterCraft Parts, Ltd.; MasterCraft International Sales Administration, Inc.; Aviara Boats, LLC; Nautic Star, LLC; NS Transport, LLC; and Crest Marine, LLC. The Company acquired NauticStar on October 2, 2017 and Crest on October 1, 2018. Holdings and its subsidiaries collectively are referred to herein as the “Company.” Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation — The accompanying financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries from the dates of their acquisitions. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Holdings has no independent operations and no material assets, other than its wholly owned equity interests in its subsidiaries, as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, and no material liabilities. As of June 30, 2021 and 2020, Holdings had no material contingencies, long-term obligations, or guarantees other than a guarantee of its subsidiaries’ long-term debt (see Note 8). Use of Estimates — The preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and related disclosures. The Company bases these estimates on historical results and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable. The Company’s most significant financial statement estimates include impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, warranty liability, unrecognized tax positions, inventory repurchase contingent obligations, and impairment of long-lived assets and intangible assets subject to amortization. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Reclassifications — Certain historical amounts have been reclassified in the accompanying consolidated financial statements to conform to the current presentation. Revenue Recognition — The Company’s revenue is derived primarily from the sale of boats and trailers, marine parts, and accessories to its independent dealers. The Company recognizes revenue when obligations under the terms of a contract are satisfied and control over promised goods is transferred to a customer. For substantially all sales, this occurs when the product is released to the carrier responsible for transporting it to a customer. The Company typically receives payment within 5 business days of shipment. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration it expects to receive in exchange for a product. The Company offers dealer incentives that include wholesale rebates, retail rebates and promotions, floor plan reimbursement or cash discounts, and other allowances that are recorded as reductions of revenues in Net sales in the consolidated statements of operations. The consideration recognized represents the amount specified in a contract with a customer, net of estimated incentives the Company reasonably expects to pay. The estimated liability and reduction in revenue for dealer incentives is recorded at the time of sale. Subsequent adjustments to incentive estimates are possible because actual results may differ from these estimates if conditions dictate the need to enhance or reduce sales promotion and incentive programs or if dealer achievement or other items vary from historical trends. Accrued dealer incentives are included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Rebates and Discounts Dealers earn wholesale rebates based on purchase volume commitments and achievement of certain performance metrics. The Company estimates the amount of wholesale rebates based on historical achievement, forecasted volume, and assumptions regarding dealer behavior. Rebates that apply to boats already in dealer inventory are referred to as retail rebates. The Company estimates the amount of retail rebates based on historical data for specific boat models adjusted for forecasted sales volume, product mix, dealer and consumer behavior, and assumptions concerning market conditions. The Company also utilizes various programs whereby it offers cash discounts or agrees to reimburse its dealers for certain floor plan interest costs incurred by dealers for limited periods of time, generally ranging up to nine months . Shipping and Handling Costs Shipping and handling costs includes those costs incurred to transport product to customers and internal handling costs, which relate to activities to prepare goods for shipment . The Company has elected to account for shipping and handling costs associated with F-9 outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a customer as a fulfillment cost. The Company includes shipping and handling costs , including costs billed to customers , in Cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations. Contract Liabilities A contract liability is created when customers prepay for goods prior to the Company transferring control of those goods to the customer. The contract liability is reduced once control of the goods is transferred to the customer. The difference between the opening and closing balances of the Company’s contract liabilities primarily results from the timing difference between the Company’s performance and the point at which it receives pre-payment from the customer. Other Revenue Recognition Matters Dealers generally have no right to return unsold boats. Occasionally, the Company may accept returns in limited circumstances and at the Company’s discretion under its warranty policy. The Company may be obligated, in the event of default by a dealer, to accept returns of unsold boats under its repurchase commitment to floor financing providers, who are able to obtain such boats through foreclosure. The repurchase commitment is on an individual unit basis with a term from the date it is financed by the lending institution through the payment date by the dealer, generally not exceeding 30 months. The Company accounts for these arrangements as guarantees and recognizes a liability based on the estimated fair value of the repurchase obligation. The estimated fair value takes into account our estimate of the loss we will incur upon resale of any repurchases. The Company accrues the estimated fair value of this obligation based on the age of inventory currently under floor plan financing and estimated credit quality of dealers holding the inventory. Inputs used to estimate this fair value include significant unobservable inputs that reflect the Company’s assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use and, therefore, this liability is classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The Company has excluded sales and other taxes assessed by a governmental authority in connection with revenue-producing activities from the determination of the transaction price for all contracts. The Company has not adjusted Net sales for the effects of a significant financing component because the period between the transfer of the promised goods and the customer's payment is expected to be one year or less. Accounts Receivable — Accounts receivable represents amounts billed to customers under credit terms customary in its industry. The Company normally does not charge interest on its accounts receivable . The Company carries its accounts receivable at face value, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts, which the company records on a regular basis based upon known bad debt risks and past loss history, customer payment practices and economic conditions. Actual collection experience may differ from the current estimate of net receivables. A change to the allowance for doubtful accounts may be required if a future event or other change in circumstances results in a change in the estimate of the ultimate collectability of a specific account. Amounts recorded as bad debt expense, write-offs, and recoveries were not material for the years ended June 30, 2021, 2020, and 2019. Cash and Cash Equivalents — The Company considers all highly-liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents. The Company’s cash deposits may at times exceed federally insured amounts. The Company had no cash equivalents at June 30, 2021 and 2020. Concentrations of Credit and Business Risk — Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of trade receivables. Credit risk on trade receivables is mitigated as a result of the Company’s use of trade letters of credit, dealer floor plan financing arrangements, and the geographically diversified nature of the Company’s customer base. Supplier Concentrations The Company is dependent on the ability of its suppliers to provide products on a timely basis and on favorable pricing terms. The loss of certain principal suppliers or a significant reduction in product availability from principal suppliers could have a material adverse effect on the Company. Business risk insurance is in place to mitigate the business risk associated with sole suppliers for sudden disruptions such as those caused by natural disasters. The Company is dependent on third-party equipment manufacturers, distributors, and dealers for certain parts and materials utilized in the manufacturing process. During the years ended June 30, 2021, 2020, and 2019 the Company purchased all engines for its MasterCraft performance sport boats under a supply agreement with a single vendor. Total purchases from this vendor were $ 40.6 million, $ 27.6 million, and $ 39.3 million for the years ended June 30, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. During the years ended June 30, 2021, 2020, and 2019, the Company purchased a majority of engines for its NauticStar boats under a supply agreement with one vendor. Total purchases from this vendor were $ 14.8 million, $ 15.2 million, and $ 23.7 million for the years ended June 30, 2021. 2020, and 2019, respectively. During the years ended June 30, 2021, 2020, and 2019, the Company purchased a majority of the F-10 engines for its Crest boats under a supply agreement with a single vendor. Total purchases from this vendor were $ 23.6 million , $ 15.5 million , and $ 20.4 million for the years ended June 30, 202 1, 20 20 , and 2019, respectively . Inventories — Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value and are shown net of an inventory allowance in the consolidated balance sheet. Inventory cost includes material, labor, and manufacturing overhead and is determined based on the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Provisions are made as necessary to reduce inventory amounts to their net realizable value or to provide for obsolete inventory. Property, Plant, and Equipment — Property, plant, and equipment are recorded at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives. Repairs and maintenance are charged to operations as incurred, and expenditures for additions and improvements that increase the asset’s useful life are capitalized. Ranges of asset lives used for depreciation purposes are: Buildings and improvements 7 - 40 years Machinery and equipment 3 - 7 years Furniture and fixtures 3 - 7 years Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets — The Company does not amortize goodwill and other purchased intangible assets with indefinite lives. The Company’s intangible assets with finite lives consist primarily of dealer networks and are carried at their estimated fair values at the time of acquisition, less accumulated amortization. Amortization is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets (see Note 6). Intangible assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment using a process similar to that used to evaluate long-lived assets described below. The Company has three reporting units, MasterCraft, NauticStar, and Crest, which each relate to an operating segment as described in Note 13. All of the Company’s goodwill assets relate to the MasterCraft reporting unit and all of the Company’s other intangible assets relate to each of the three reporting units. Goodwill Goodwill results from the excess of purchase price over the net identifiable assets of businesses acquired. The Company reviews goodwill for impairment annually, at its fiscal year-end annual impairment testing date, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit may be below its carrying value. As part of the annual test, the Company may perform a qualitative, rather than quantitative, assessment to determine whether the fair values of its reporting units are “more likely than not” to be greater than their carrying values. In performing this qualitative analysis, the Company considers various factors, including the effect of market or industry changes and the reporting units' actual results compared to projected results. If the fair value of a reporting unit does not meet the ""more likely than not"" criteria discussed above, the impairment test for goodwill is a quantitative test. This test involves comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, goodwill is not considered impaired. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value then the goodwill is considered impaired and an impairment loss is recognized in an amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of the goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The Company calculates the fair value of its reporting units by considering both the income approach and market approach. The income approach calculates the fair value of the reporting unit using a discounted cash flow method. Internally forecasted future cash flows, which the Company believes reasonably approximate market participant assumptions, are discounted using a weighted average cost of capital (“Discount Rate”) developed for each reporting unit. The Discount Rate is developed using observable market inputs, as well as considering whether or not there is a measure of risk related to the specific reporting unit’s forecasted performance. Fair value under the market approach is determined for each unit by applying market multiples for comparable public companies to the unit’s financial results. The key judgements in these calculations are the assumptions used in determining the reporting unit’s forecasted future performance, including revenue growth and operating margins, as well as the perceived risk associated with those forecasts in determining the Discount Rate, along with selecting representative market multiples. The Company recognized no impairments related to goodwill for the year ended June 30, 2021. During the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company performed quantitative impairment tests for all three reporting units and determined that goodwill attributable to the NauticStar and Crest reporting units was impaired. As a result, the Company recognized associated impairment charges during each of those fiscal years (see Note 6). F-11 Other Intangible Assets The Company's primary intangible assets other than goodwill are dealer networks and trade names acquired in business combinations. These intangible assets are initially valued using a methodology commensurate with the intended use of the asset. The dealer networks were valued using an income approach, which requires an estimate or forecast of the expected future cash flows from the dealer network through the application of the multi-period excess earnings approach. The fair value of trade names is measured using a relief-from-royalty approach, a variation of the income approach, which requires an estimate or forecast of the expected future cash flows. This method assumes the value of the trade name is the discounted cash flows of the amount that would be paid to third parties had the Company not owned the trade name and instead licensed the trade name from another company. The basis for future sales projections for these methods are based on internal revenue forecasts by reporting unit, which the Company believes represent reasonable market participant assumptions. The future cash flows are discounted using an applicable Discount Rate as well as any potential risk premium to reflect the inherent risk of holding a standalone intangible asset. The key judgements in these fair value calculations, as applicable, are: assumptions used in developing internal revenue growth and dealer expense forecasts, assumed dealer attrition rates, the selection of an appropriate royalty rate, as well as the perceived risk associated with those forecasts in determining the Discount Rate. The costs of amortizable intangible assets, including dealer networks, are recognized over their expected useful lives, approximately ten years for the dealer networks, using the straight-line method. Intangible assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment using a process similar to that used to evaluate long-lived assets described below. Intangible assets not subject to amortization are assessed for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that an asset may be impaired. As part of the annual test, the Company may perform a qualitative, rather than quantitative, assessment to determine whether each trade name intangible asset is “more likely than not” impaired. In performing this qualitative analysis, the Company considers various factors, including macroeconomic events, industry and market events and cost related events. If the “more likely than not” criteria is not met, the impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset. The Company recognized no impairments related to other intangible assets for the year ended June 30, 2021. During the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company performed quantitative impairment tests for intangible assets and determined that trade names attributable to the NauticStar and Crest reporting units were impaired. As a result, the Company recognized associated impairment charges during each of those fiscal years (see Note 6). Long-Lived Assets Other than Intangible Assets — The Company assesses the potential for impairment of its long-lived assets if facts and circumstances, such as declines in sales, earnings, or cash flows or adverse changes in the business climate, suggest that they may be impaired. The Company performs its review by comparing the book value of the assets to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the assets. If any impairment in the carrying value of its long-lived assets is indicated, the assets would be adjusted to an estimate of fair value. The Company incurred no such impairments during the years ended June 30, 2021, 2020, and 2019. Product Warranties — The Company offers warranties on the sale of certain products for periods of between one and five years . These warranties require us or our dealers to repair or replace defective products during the warranty period at no cost to the consumer. We estimate the costs that may be incurred under our basic limited warranty and record as a liability the amount of such costs at the time the product revenue is recognized. Factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of units sold, historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims, and cost per claim. We periodically assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as actual claims are determined or as changes in the obligations become reasonably estimable. We also adjust our liability for specific warranty matters when they become known, and the exposure can be estimated. Future warranty claims may differ from our estimate of the warranty liability, which could lead to changes in the Company’s warranty liability in future periods. Income Taxes — Income tax expense is the total of the current year income tax due or refundable and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Company records its global tax provision based on the respective tax rules and regulations for the jurisdictions in which it operates. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are the expected future tax amounts for the temporary differences between carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities, computed using enacted tax rates. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. Significant judgment is required in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets. The realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income. F-12 A tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is “more likely than not” that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the “more likely than not” test, no tax benefit is recorded. The Company recognizes interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. In determining the amount of current and deferred tax the Company takes into account the impact of uncertain tax positions and whether additional taxes, interest and penalties may be due. The Company believes that its accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open tax years based on its assessment of many factors, including interpretations of tax law and prior experience. This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of judgments about future events. New information may become available that causes the Company to change its judgment regarding the adequacy of existing tax liabilities; such changes to tax liabilities will have an impact on tax expense in the period that such a determination is made. Research and Development — Research and development expenditures are expensed as incurred. Research and development expense for the years ended June 30, 2021, 2020, and 2019 was $ 6.8 million, $ 5.2 million, and $ 5.6 million, respectively, and is included in Operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. Self-Insurance — The Company is self-insured for certain losses relating to product liability claims and employee medical claims. The Company has purchased stop-loss coverage in order to limit its exposure to any significant levels for these matters. Losses are accrued based on the Company’s estimates of the aggregate liability for self-insured claims incurred using certain actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and the Company’s historical experience. Deferred Debt Issuance Costs — Certain costs incurred to obtain financing are capitalized and amortized over the term of the related debt using the effective interest method. For the years ended June 30, 2021, 2020, and 2019 the Company incurred deferred financing costs of $ 0.6 million, $ 0.3 million, and $ 0.7 million, respectively. For the years ended June 30, 2021, 2020, and 2019, the Company recorded related amortization expense of $ 0.6 million for each year. Additionally, for the year ended June 30, 2021, the Company recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $ 0.7 million related to the debt refinancing in fiscal 2021 (Note 8). Share-Based Compensation — The Company records amounts for all share-based compensation, including grants of restricted stock awards, performance stock units, and nonqualified stock options over the vesting period in the consolidated statements of operations based on their fair values at the date of the grant. Forfeitures of share-based compensation, if any, are recognized as they occur. Share-based compensation costs are included in Selling and marketing and General and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of Operations. See Note 10 – Share-Based Compensation for a description of the Company's accounting for share-based compensation plans. Leases — The Company leases various equipment under operating lease arrangements. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at lease inception. Operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date. Because the rates implicit in the Company's lease contracts are not readily determinable, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of future payments. The incremental borrowing rate is estimated to approximate the interest rate on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments, and in economic environments where the leased asset is located. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any initial direct costs and lease payments made prior to lease commencement and excludes lease incentives incurred. The Company's lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company may enter into lease agreements that contain both lease and non-lease components, which it has elected to account for as a single lease component for all asset classes. See Note 11 for information regarding the Company’s leases. Advertising — Advertising costs are expensed when the advertising first takes place. Advertising expense recognized during the years ended June 30, 2021, 2020, and 2019, was $ 4.8 million, $ 7.0 million, and $ 9.3 million, respectively, and is included in Selling and marketing expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. F-13 Fair Value Measurements — The Company measures certain of its financial assets and liabilities at fair value and utilizes the established framework for measuring fair value and disclosing information about fair value measurements. Fair value is the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair values: Level 1 — Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity has the ability to access as of the measurement date. Level 2 — Significant other observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. Level 3 — Significant unobservable inputs that reflect a company’s own assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. When measuring fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. When possible, the Company looks to active and observable markets to price identical assets. When identical assets are not traded in active markets, the Company looks to market observable data for similar assets. The Company’s most significant financial asset or liability measured at fair value on a recurring basis is its inventory repurchase contingent obligation (see “Revenue Recognition - Other Revenue Recognition Matters” and Note 11). Fair Value of Financial Instruments — The carrying amounts of the Company’s financial instruments, consisting of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and other liabilities, approximate their estimated fair values due to the relative short-term nature of the amounts. The carrying amount of debt approximates fair value due to variable interest rates at customary terms and rates the Company could obtain in current financing. Earnings Per Common Share — Basic earnings per common share reflects reported earnings divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted earnings per common share include the effect of dilutive stock options, restricted stock awards, and performance stock units unless inclusion would not be dilutive. Postretirement Benefits – The Company has a defined contribution plan and makes contributions including matching and discretionary contributions which are based on various percentages of compensation, and in some instances are based on the amount of the employees' contributions to the plans. The expense related to the defined contribution plans was $ 1.7 million, $ 1.2 million, and $ 1.2 million for the years ended June 30, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. New Accounting Pronouncements Issued And Adopted Fair Value Measurements — In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework—Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement . This guidance modifies the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements in Topic 820 by removing disclosures regarding transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, by modifying the measurement uncertainty disclosure, and by requiring additional disclosures for Level 3 fair value measurements, among others. The Company adopted this guidance for its fiscal year beginning July 1, 2020 . The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. Current Expected Credit Loss — In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326) , which updated the ASC to use an impairment model that is based on expected losses rather than incurred losses. The Company adopted this guidance for its fiscal year beginning July 1, 2020 . The adoption of this standard did not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements. F-14 New Accounting Pronouncements Issued But Not Yet Adopted Income Taxes — In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes . ASU 2019-12 simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to general principles in Income Taxes (Topic 740). It also clarifies and amends existing guidance to improve consistent application. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. We are currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on our consolidated financial statements. Reference Rate Reform — In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting . ASU 2020-04 provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions, subject to meeting certain criteria, that reference London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. An entity may apply ASU 2020-04 as of any date from the beginning of an interim period that includes or is subsequent to March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. The Company expects that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 2.

F-15 See Note 1 for a description of the Company’s significant revenue recognition policies and Note 13 for a description of the Company’s segments. 3. ACQUISITIONS Fiscal 2019 Acquisition On October 1, 2018, the Company completed its acquisition of Crest for $ 81.7 million. Crest, a manufacturer of pontoons, expands the Company’s product portfolio. Proceeds from the $ 80.0 term loan (see Note 8) were used to fund this acquisition. The following table is a summary of the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and net cash consideration paid for Crest during fiscal 2019: Fair Value Accounts receivable $ 5,215 Inventories 9,853 Other current assets 179 Property, plant and equipment 1,840 Identifiable intangible assets (a) 35,245 Current liabilities ( 6,841 ) Fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 45,491 Goodwill (a) 36,238 Net cash consideration paid $ 81,729 (a) The goodwill and other intangible assets recorded for the Crest acquisition are deductible for tax purposes. See Note 6 for additional information. Fair Value Estimated Useful Life (in years) Definite-lived intangible assets: Dealer network $ 18,000 10 Software 245 5 Indefinite-lived intangible asset: Trade name 17,000 Total identifiable intangible assets $ 35,245 Related Party Transactions In connection with the operations of Crest, the Company made rental payments to Crest Marine Real Estate LLC (“Real Estate”) for a manufacturing facility, storage and office building (the “Crest Facility”). One of the minority owners of Real Estate is a member of the Crest management team. The lease was to expire on September 30, 2028 , and was subject to four consecutive, five-year renewal periods. The lease terms included an option for the Company to purchase the Crest Facility for an amount equal to its fair market value, as determined by appraisals and negotiation between the Company and Real Estate (the “Purchase Option”). The annual rent under the lease was $ 0.3 million for the first five years of the lease term, and was to increase to $ 0.4 million for the remaining five years. Additionally, at the beginning of each of the optional renewal terms the rent was to be adjusted based on the change in the Consumer Price Index. In accordance with the Purchase Option, on October 24, 2019 the Company purchased the Crest Facility for $ 4.1 million. See Note 11 for additional information regarding the purchase. Crest purchases fiberglass component parts from a supplier whose minority owner had been the same member of the Crest management team that had a minority ownership interest in Real Estate. On January 31, 2020 this minority ownership interest was divested and this supplier ceased being a related party. During the period beginning July 1, 2019 and ending January 31, 2020, the Company purchased $ 1.8 million of products from the supplier. During the year ended June 30, 2019, the Company purchased $ 2.8 million of products from the supplier. F-16 Pro Forma Financial Information The following unaudited pro forma consolidated results of operations for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 assumes that the acquisition of Crest occurred as of July 1, 2018. The unaudited pro forma financial information combines historical results of MasterCraft, NauticStar, and Crest with adjustments for depreciation and amortization attributable to fair value estimates on acquired tangible and intangible assets for the period. Non-recurring pro forma adjustments associated with the fair value step up of inventory were included in the reported pro forma cost of sales and earnings. The unaudited pro forma financial information is not indicative of the results of operations that would have been achieved if the acquisition had taken place at the beginning of fiscal year 2019, or the results that may occur in the future: Fiscal Year Ended 2019 Net sales $ 487,374 Net income $ 21,619 Basic earnings per share $ 1.16 Diluted earnings per share $ 1.15 4. INVENTORIES Inventories consisted of the following: As of June 30, 2021 2020 Raw materials and supplies $ 37,089 $ 18,318 Work in process 10,171 3,866 Finished goods 8,362 4,876 Obsolescence reserve ( 2,141 ) ( 1,424 ) Total inventories $ 53,481 $ 25,636 During 2021, the Company increased overall production levels, as well as increased safety stock as of June 30, 2021 to manage increased supply chain risks. 5. PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT Property, plant, and equipment, net consisted of the following: As of June 30, 2021 2020 Land and improvements $ 5,955 $ 3,030 Buildings and improvements 35,890 22,366 Machinery and equipment 42,526 38,262 Furniture and fixtures 3,126 2,229 Construction in progress 5,737 1,312 Total property, plant, and equipment 93,234 67,199 Less accumulated depreciation ( 32,739 ) ( 26,718 ) Property, plant, and equipment, net $ 60,495 $ 40,481 F-17 Depreciation expense for the years ended June 30, 2021, 2020, and 2019 was $ 7.7 million, $ 6.6 million, and $ 4.3 million, respectively. Merritt Island Facility During October 2020, we completed the purchase of certain real property located in Merritt Island, Florida, including a boat manufacturing facility, for a purchase price of $ 14.2 million (the “Merritt Island Facility”). We expanded our overall boat building capacity by moving all Aviara production to the Merritt Island Facility. Additionally, removing Aviara production from our Vonore, Tennessee facility provided for an immediate increase in capacity and production for our MasterCraft brand. 6. GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS Goodwill and Other Intangible Asset Impairment See Note 1 for a discussion of the methods used to determine the fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets. In assessing the need for goodwill and intangible impairment, management utilizes a number of estimates, including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, transactions and marketplace data. Accordingly, these fair value measurements fall in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. In March 2020, the World Health Organization announced that the outbreak of the novel coronavirus had become a worldwide pandemic. The resulting economic environment, including the significant share price and market volatility, as well as disruptions to supply chains resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, triggered an interim impairment analysis for the Company’s intangible assets including goodwill. As a result of this analysis, the Company recorded impairment charges totaling $ 56.4 million during the three months ended March 29, 2020 related to the NauticStar and Crest segments. The impairment charges recorded within each segment are detailed below and are included in Goodwill and other intangible asset impairment on the consolidated statement of operations. The impairment recorded in fiscal 2020 was principally a result of a decline, in the fiscal third quarter, in market conditions, including our share price, and the then current outlook for sales and operating performance relative to the Company’s acquisition plans and impairment test performed as of June 30, 2019. During our fiscal 2019 annual assessment of intangible assets including goodwill, the Company recorded impairment charges of $ 31.0 million within the NauticStar segment. The impairment was principally a result of a decline, in the fiscal fourth quarter, in the outlook for sales and operating performance relative to our acquisition plan. As of June 30, 2021, our annual impairment test date, the Company performed a qualitative assessment and identified no events or circumstances that indicated that there existed a more likely than not probability of impairment of goodwill within our MasterCraft segment or other intangible assets within each of our segments. Goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges for the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 were as follows: 2020 2019 NauticStar Crest Consolidated NauticStar Consolidated Goodwill $ 8,199 $ 36,238 $ 44,437 $ 28,000 $ 28,000 Trade name 5,000 7,000 12,000 3,000 3,000 Total $ 13,199 $ 43,238 $ 56,437 $ 31,000 $ 31,000 While the extent and duration of the economic impact from the COVID-19 pandemic remain unclear, changes in assumptions and estimates may affect the fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets and could result in additional impairment charges in future periods. Goodwill The carrying amounts of goodwill as of both June 30, 2021 and 2020, attributable to each of the Company’s reportable segments, were as follows: F-18 Gross Amount Accumulated Impairment Losses Total MasterCraft $ 29,593 $ - $ 29,593 NauticStar 36,199 ( 36,199 ) - Crest 36,238 ( 36,238 ) - Total $ 102,030 $ ( 72,437 ) $ 29,593 Other Intangible Assets The following table presents the carrying amount of Other intangible assets, net as of June 30, 2021 and 2020. 2021 2020 Gross Amount Accumulated Amortization / Impairment Other intangible assets, net Gross Amount Accumulated Amortization / Impairment Other intangible assets, net Amortized intangible assets Dealer networks $ 39,500 $ ( 13,711 ) $ 25,789 $ 39,500 $ ( 9,810 ) $ 29,690 Software 245 ( 135 ) 110 245 ( 86 ) 159 39,745 ( 13,846 ) 25,899 39,745 ( 9,896 ) 29,849 Unamortized intangible assets Trade names 49,000 ( 15,000 ) 34,000 49,000 ( 15,000 ) 34,000 Total other intangible assets $ 88,745 $ ( 28,846 ) $ 59,899 $ 88,745 $ ( 24,896 ) $ 63,849 Amortization expense related to Other intangible assets, net for years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $ 3.9 million, $ 3.9 million, and $ 3.5 million, respectively. The following table presents estimated future amortization expense for the next five fiscal years and thereafter. Fiscal years ending June 30, 2022 $ 3,950 2023 3,950 2024 3,806 2025 3,793 2026 3,793 and thereafter 6,607 Total $ 25,899 7. ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES Accrued expenses and other current liabilities consisted of the following: As of June 30, 2021 2020 Warranty $ 22,329 $ 20,004 Dealer incentives 10,634 9,180 Compensation and related accruals 6,046 1,488 Contract liabilities 1,848 559 Self-insurance 865 704 Inventory repurchase contingent obligation 471 1,132 Other 4,643 2,918 Total accrued expenses and other current liabilities $ 46,836 $ 35,985 F-19 Accrued warranty liability activity was as follows: For the Years Ended June 30, 2021 2020 Balance at the beginning of the period $ 20,004 $ 17,205 Provisions 9,846 7,039 Payments made ( 9,116 ) ( 7,634 ) Aggregate changes for preexisting warranties 1,595 3,394 Balance at the end of the period $ 22,329 $ 20,004 8. LONG-TERM DEBT Long-term debt outstanding was as follows: As of June 30, 2021 2020 Revolving credit facility $ 33,728 $ 10,000 Term loans 60,000 99,993 Debt issuance costs on term loans ( 585 ) ( 1,395 ) Total debt 93,143 108,598 Less current portion of long-term debt 3,000 9,420 Less current portion of debt issuance costs on term loans ( 134 ) ( 488 ) Long-term debt, net of current portion $ 90,277 $ 99,666 Previously Existing Credit Facility On October 1, 2018, the Company entered into a Fourth Amended and Restated Credit and Guaranty Agreement with a syndicate of certain financial institutions (the “Fourth Amended Credit Agreement”). The Fourth Amended Credit Agreement provided the Company with a $ 190.0 million senior secured credit facility, consisting of a $ 75.0 million term loan, an $ 80.0 million term loan, and a $ 35.0 million revolving credit facility. Proceeds from the $ 80.0 million term loan were used to fund the Crest acquisition (see Note 3). On May 7, 2020, the Company entered into Amendment No. 3 to the Fourth Amended Credit Agreement (the “Amendment”). The changes effected by the Amendment include, among others, the temporary removal and replacement of the Company’s financial covenants, the addition of a 50 basis point floor on LIBOR, modifications to the range of applicable LIBOR and prime interest rate margins, and a revision of the total net leverage ratio calculation. Under the Amendment, the total net leverage ratio covenant and fixed charge coverage ratio covenant of the Fourth Amended Credit Agreement were temporarily replaced with three separate covenants: (i) an interest coverage ratio, (ii) a minimum liquidity threshold, and (iii) a maximum unfinanced capital expenditures limitation (the “Package of Financial Covenants”). The Package of Financial Covenants were in place through the quarter ended March 31, 2021, at which time the total net leverage ratio covenant and fixed charge coverage ratio covenant were reinstated and the Package of Financial Covenants sunsetted, and with the minimum liquidity covenant being tested on the last day of each fiscal month through May 31, 2021. In addition, the total net leverage ratio calculation was temporarily revised to include all unrestricted cash balances, without limitation, until June 30, 2021. On October 26, 2020, the Company entered into Amendment No. 4 and Joinder to the Fourth Amended Credit Agreement (the “Amendment No. 4”). In conjunction with the new Merritt Island Facility purchase (see Note 5), the assets were organized in a new wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The changes effected by Amendment No. 4 added this new subsidiary as a borrower under the Fourth Amended Credit Agreement. Pursuant to the Amendment, the Company’s debt bore interest at LIBOR, subject to a 50 basis point floor, plus 3.25% through June 30, 2020. Beginning on July 1, 2020, the applicable margin, at the Company’s option, is at either the prime rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.5 % to 2.25 % or at an adjusted LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.50 % to 3.25 %, in each case based on the Company’s total net leverage ratio. F-20 Current Credit Facility On June 28, 2021, the Company entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of certain financial institutions (the “Credit Agreement”). The Credit Agreement provides the Company with a $ 160.0 million senior secured credit facility, consisting of a $ 60.0 million term loan (the “Term Loan”) and a $ 100.0 million revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”). The Credit Agreement refinanced and replaced the Fourth Amended Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement is secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the Company’s assets. The Credit Agreement contains a number of covenants that, among other things, restrict the Company’s ability to, subject to specified exceptions, incur additional debt; incur additional liens and contingent liabilities; sell or dispose of assets; merge with or acquire other companies; liquidate or dissolve; engage in businesses that are not in a related line of business; make loans, advances or guarantees; pay dividends or make other distributions; engage in transactions with affiliates; and make investments. The Company is also required to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum net leverage ratio. The Credit Agreement bears interest, at the Company’s option, at either the prime rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.25 % to 1.00 % or at an adjusted LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.25 % to 2.00 %, in each case based on the Company’s net leverage ratio. The Company is also required to pay a commitment fee for any unused portion of the revolving credit facility ranging from 0.15 % to 0.30 % based on the Company’s net leverage ratio. The Credit Agreement will mature and all remaining amounts outstanding thereunder will be due and payable on June 28, 2026. As of June 30, 2021, the Company was in compliance with its financial covenants under the Credit Agreement. As a result of entering into the Credit Agreement, the Company recognized a $ 0.7 million loss on early extinguishment of debt. The remaining $ 0.5 million of unamortized deferred financing costs, plus additional capitalized amounts of $ 0.6 million are being amortized over the term of the Credit Agreement. As of June 30, 2021 and 2020, the effective interest rate on borrowings outstanding was 1.38 % and 3.75 %, respectively. Revolving Credit Facility On March 19, 2020, the Company drew $ 35.0 million on its revolving credit facility under the Fourth Amended Credit Agreement as a precautionary measure in order to increase its cash position and preserve financial flexibility in light of uncertainty in the global markets resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. As of June 30, 2020, the Company had $ 10.0 million of borrowings outstanding under its revolving credit facility. The Company subsequently repaid all outstanding amounts during the three months ended October 4, 2020. During October 2020, the Company borrowed $ 20.0 million under the revolving credit facility to fund the purchase of the Merritt Island Facility. The Company subsequently repaid all outstanding amounts as of April 4, 2021. In conjunction with the Credit Agreement entered into on June 28, 2021, the Company drew $ 33.7 million on its Revolving Credit Facility. Drawn amounts were used to repay a same amount of outstanding borrowings under the term loans under the Fourth Amended Credit Agreement. As of June 30, 2021, the Company had $ 33.7 million of borrowings outstanding on its Revolving Credit Facility and had remaining availability of $ 66.3 million.

INCOME TAXES Earnings before income taxes by jurisdiction were all in the U.S. except for income of approximately $ 0.1 million during each of the years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019. For the years ended June 30, the components of the provision for income taxes are as follows: 2021 2020 2019 Current income tax expense: Federal $ 12,231 $ 2,096 $ 10,405 State 3,057 666 1,892 Benefit of current year tax credits ( 469 ) ( 554 ) ( 171 ) Total current tax expense $ 14,819 $ 2,208 $ 12,126 Deferred tax expense (benefit): Federal $ 1,471 $ ( 8,887 ) $ ( 5,837 ) State ( 632 ) ( 886 ) ( 897 ) Total deferred tax expense (benefit) 839 ( 9,773 ) ( 6,734 ) Income tax expense (benefit) $ 15,658 $ ( 7,565 ) $ 5,392 The difference between the statutory and the effective federal tax rate for the periods below is attributable to the following: 2021 2020 2019 Statutory income tax rate 21.00 % 21.00 % 21.00 % State taxes (net of federal income tax benefit and valuation allowance) 1.66 % 1.67 % 2.48 % Tax credits ( 0.98 %) 4.49 % ( 3.39 %) Change in valuation allowance 0.19 % — ( 0.57 %) Permanent differences ( 0.69 %) ( 0.74 %) ( 2.54 %) Uncertain tax positions 0.67 % ( 2.49 %) 3.10 % Other ( 0.05 %) — 0.08 % Effective income tax rate 21.80 % 23.93 % 20.16 % F-22 As of June 30, 2021, and 2020, a summary of the significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities was as follows: 2021 2020 Deferred tax assets: Goodwill and other intangible asset basis difference $ 12,862 $ 13,776 Warranty reserves 5,258 4,616 Accrued selling 368 850 Unrecognized tax benefits 665 566 Stock compensation 761 402 Repurchase agreements 111 261 State net operating loss 433 14 Accrued compensation 529 68 Other 805 630 Total deferred tax assets 21,792 21,183 Valuation allowance ( 177 ) ( 65 ) Total deferred tax assets, net of the valuation allowance 21,615 21,118 Deferred tax liabilities: Depreciation ( 5,845 ) ( 4,839 ) Other ( 640 ) ( 199 ) Total deferred tax liabilities ( 6,485 ) ( 5,038 ) Net deferred tax assets $ 15,130 $ 16,080 On March 27, 2020, President Trump signed into law the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (H.R. 748) (the “CARES Act”). Among the changes to the U.S. federal income tax rules, the CARES Act included a revision to depreciation rules enacted as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. In addition to impacting the previous fiscal year, the CARES Act results in the ability to retroactively apply these regulations to certain assets placed in service during the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2019. The Company has evaluated the impacts of the aforementioned provisions and incorporated the necessary changes to tax depreciation methods. We have not identified any material effect on results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. As of June 30, 2021, the Company has state net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards of $ 10.5 million. Of this amount, $ 3.4 million expire in varying years ranging from June 30, 2024 to June 30, 2036, while the remainder can be carried forward indefinitely. The Company has foreign NOL carryforwards of $ 0.2 million that can be carried forward indefinitely. However, the Company determined that it is more likely than not that the benefit from certain state and foreign NOL carryforwards will not be realized. In recognition of this risk, the Company has provided a partial valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets relating to these state and foreign NOL carryforwards. Unrecognized Tax Benefits A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits, excluding accrued amounts for interest and penalties, is as follows: 2021 2020 Balance at July 1 $ 2,993 $ 2,504 Additions based on tax positions related to the current year 1,113 110 Additions for tax positions of prior years 77 713 Reductions for tax positions of prior years ( 412 ) ( 164 ) Settlements of tax positions from prior years ( 467 ) ( 170 ) Balance at June 30 $ 3,304 $ 2,993 F-23 Of this total, $ 2.7 million and $ 2.1 million as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, represent the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably affect the effective income tax rate in future periods. The total amount of interest and penalties recorded in the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended June 30, 2021, 2020, and, 2019 was a benefit of $ 0.2 million and an expense of $ 0.3 million and $ 0.1 million, respectively. The amounts accrued for interest and penalties at June 30, 2021 and 2020 were $ 0.5 million and $ 0.7 million, respectively, and is presented in unrecognized tax positions on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. In general, it is the practice and intention of the Company to reinvest the earnings of its non-U.S. subsidiaries in those operations. As of June 30, 2021, the Company has not made a provision for U.S. or additional foreign withholding taxes on investments in foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested. Generally, such amounts become subject to U.S. taxation upon the remittance of dividends and under certain other circumstances. The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal income tax, as well as various other state income taxes and foreign income taxes. The federal income tax returns for the years ended June 30, 2018 through 2020 are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service. For state purposes, the statutes of limitation vary by jurisdiction. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to examination by taxing authorities for years before June 30, 2018. The Company expects the total amount of unrecognized benefits to increase by approximately $ 1.8 million in the next twelve months. The Company records unrecognized tax benefits as liabilities and adjusts these liabilities when its judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. Because of the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the unrecognized tax benefit liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which new information is available. 10. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION The 2015 Incentive Award Plan (“2015 Plan”) provides for the grant of stock options, including incentive stock options, and nonqualified stock options (“NSOs”), restricted stock, dividend equivalents, stock payments, restricted stock units, restricted stock awards (“RSAs”), deferred stock, deferred stock units, performance awards, stock appreciation rights, performance stock units (“PSUs”), and cash awards. As of June 30, 2021, there were 1,305,458 shares available for issuance under the 2015 Plan. The following table presents the components of share-based compensation expense by award type for the years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019. 2021 2020 2019 Restricted stock awards $ 1,545 $ 1,285 $ 913 Performance stock units 1,439 ( 233 ) 563 Stock options - 9 201 Share-based compensation expense $ 2,984 $ 1,061 $ 1,677 The amount of compensation cost the Company recognizes over the requisite service period is based on the Company’s best estimate of the achievement of the performance conditions and can fluctuate over time. Adjustment to Share-Based Compensation In conjunction with the resignation of an executive officer in October 2019, approximately $ 0.5 million of share-based compensation expense recognized in prior periods was reversed during fiscal 2020 for RSAs and PSUs that were forfeited. The following table presents the income tax benefit related to share-based compensation expense recognized by award type. 2021 2020 2019 Restricted stock awards $ 350 $ 290 $ 217 Performance stock units 326 ( 53 ) 134 Stock options - 2 48 Share-based compensation expense $ 676 $ 239 $ 399 F-24 Restricted Stock Awards All RSAs granted to non-employee directors vest over the remainder of that fiscal year, and all RSAs granted to employees vest over a period of between one to three years . Generally, non-vested RSAs are forfeited if employment is terminated prior to vesting. RSAs are granted at a per share fair value equal to the market value of the Company’s common stock on the grant date. The Company recognizes the cost of non-vested RSAs ratably over the requisite service period. The total grant date fair value of RSAs vested during the years ended June 30, 2021, 2020, and 2019 was $ 1.6 million , $ 1.0 million and $ 0.7 million, respectively. A summary of RSA activity for the years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, is as follows: Number of Restricted Stock Awards Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Total Non-vested Restricted Stock Awards at June 30, 2018 43,310 $ 17.28 Granted 51,995 26.79 Vested ( 33,093 ) 21.54 Forfeited ( 8,408 ) 23.08 Total Non-vested Restricted Stock Awards at June 30, 2019 53,804 22.94 Granted 138,457 17.41 Vested ( 50,570 ) 20.09 Forfeited ( 34,797 ) 20.24 Total Non-vested Restricted Stock Awards at June 30, 2020 106,894 18.01 Granted 93,357 20.34 Vested ( 73,385 ) 18.54 Forfeited ( 8,673 ) 19.29 Total Non-vested Restricted Stock Awards at June 30, 2021 118,193 19.42 As of June 30, 2021, there was $ 1.4 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested RSAs. The Company expects this expense to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.63 years. Performance Stock Units During the years ended June 30, 2021, 2020, and 2019, the Company granted performance shares to certain employees. The awards will be earned based on the Company’s achievement of certain performance criteria over a three-year performance period. The performance period for the awards commence on July 1 of the fiscal year in which they were granted and continue for a three-year period, ending on June 30 of the applicable year. The probability of achieving the performance criteria is assessed quarterly. Following the determination of the Company’s achievement with respect to the performance criteria, the amount of shares awarded will be subject to adjustment based on the application of a total shareholder return (“TSR”) modifier. The grant date fair value is determined based on both the assessment of the probability of the Company’s achieving the performance criteria and an estimate of the expected TSR modifier. The TSR modifier estimate is determined by using a Monte Carlo Simulation model, which considers the likelihood of all possible outcomes of long-term market performance. The amount of compensation cost the Company recognizes over the requisite service period is based on management’s best estimate of the achievement of the performance criteria. The fair value of PSUs vested during the year ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $ 0.4 million, $ 0.2 million, and $ 0.4 million, respectively. F-25 A summary of PSU activity for the years ending June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, is as follows: Number of Performance Stock Units Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Total Non-vested Performance Stock Units at June 30, 2018 59,328 $ 14.98 Granted 35,122 25.70 Vested ( 32,373 ) 11.85 Forfeited ( 11,456 ) 19.73 Total Non-vested Performance Stock Units at June 30, 2019 50,621 23.34 Granted 72,048 18.18 Vested ( 8,383 ) 19.40 Forfeited ( 46,882 ) 20.82 Total Non-vested Performance Stock Units at June 30, 2020 67,404 20.02 Granted 123,096 22.11 Vested ( 14,627 ) 26.29 Forfeited ( 15,588 ) 20.25 Total Non-vested Performance Stock Units at June 30, 2021 160,285 21.03 As of June 30, 2021, there was $ 2.2 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested PSUs. The Company expects this expense to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.83 years. Nonqualified Stock Options In July 2015, the Company granted 137,786 NSOs to certain employees. As of July 2019, all outstanding options were fully vested and exercisable. The fair value of NSOs vested during each of the years ended June 30, 2020, and 2019 was $ 0.2 million. A summary of NSO activity for the years ending June 30, 2021, 2020, and 2019 is as follows: Weighted Weighted Average Average Remaining Aggregate Exercise Contractual Intrinsic Shares Price Term (Yrs.)

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Operating Leases The Company has lease agreements for certain personal and real property. Leases with an initial lease term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. Our lease agreements do not include any significant renewal options. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. Upon adoption of ASC 842, Lease Accounting, on July 1, 2019, the Company’s most significant lease was for the Crest manufacturing facility, which was classified as an operating lease. This lease included a purchase option for the Company to acquire the premises. During the three months ended September 29, 2019, the decision was made to exercise the purchase option which resulted in $ 2.8 million of operating lease assets and liabilities being reclassified to finance lease assets and liabilities on the September 29, 2019 condensed consolidated balance sheet. In addition, the decision to exercise the purchase option resulted in the remeasurement of the related lease balances which added $ 1.3 million of additional finance lease assets and finance lease liabilities to the September 29, 2019 condensed consolidated balance sheet. In accordance with the purchase option, on October 24, 2019 the Company completed the purchase of the Crest manufacturing facility for $ 4.1 million. Upon completion of this purchase, the Company recognized approximately $ 4.1 million in Property, plant and equipment, net and derecognized approximately $ 4.1 million of both Finance lease assets and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. The purchase price of the Crest Facility was determined by appraisal and negotiation between the Company and the seller, whose minority ownership included a member of the Crest management team. The Company funded the purchase by utilizing cash from operations. The lease-related balances as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, and activity and costs during the periods presented, other than the activity related to the Crest manufacturing facility discussed above, are not material. Repurchase Obligations Under certain conditions, the Company is obligated to repurchase new inventory repossessed from dealerships by financial institutions that provide credit to the Company’s dealers. See Note 1 for more information regarding the terms and accounting policies related to this obligation. The maximum obligation of the Company under such floor plan agreements totaled approximately $ 67.0 million and $ 131.4 million as of June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020, respectively. We incurred no material impact from repurchase events during the years ended June 30, 2021, 2020, and 2019. The Company recorded a repurchase liability of $ 0.5 million and $ 1.1 million as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Purchase Commitments The Company is engaged in an exclusive contract with a single vendor to provide engines for its MasterCraft performance sport boats. This contract makes this vendor the only supplier to MasterCraft for in-board engines and expires June 30, 2023. The Company is obligated to purchase a minimum number of engines for each model year under this contract. The Company could also be required to pay a penalty to this vendor in order to maintain exclusivity if annual purchases under the agreement fail to meet a certain volume threshold. We incurred no penalties related to purchase commitments during the years ended June 30, 2021, 2020, and 2019. Legal Proceedings The Company is involved in certain claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of these matters is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Stock Repurchase Plan On June 24, 2021, the board of directors authorized a stock repurchase plan that allows for the repurchase of up to $ 50.0 million of our common stock during the three-year period ending June 24, 2024 . The timing and amount of any stock repurchases will be determined by management at its discretion based on ongoing assessments of the capital needs of the business, the market price of our common stock and general market conditions. Stock repurchases under the program may be made through a variety of methods, which may include open market purchases, accelerated share repurchases, tender offers, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise The repurchase plan may be reviewed, modified, suspended or terminated by our board of directors at any time as it deems necessary in its sole discretion. We did not repurchase any common stock during fiscal 2021. F-27 12. EARNINGS PER SHARE The factors used in the earnings per share computation are as follows: 2021 2020 2019 Net income (loss) $ 56,170 $ ( 24,047 ) $ 21,354 Weighted average shares — basic 18,805,464 18,734,482 18,653,892 Dilutive effect of assumed exercises of stock options 14,814 — 45,799 Dilutive effect of assumed restricted share awards/units 131,243 — 68,516 Weighted average outstanding shares — diluted 18,951,521 18,734,482 18,768,207 Basic net income (loss) per share $ 2.99 $ ( 1.28 ) $ 1.14 Diluted net income (loss) per share $ 2.96 $ ( 1.28 ) $ 1.14 For the year ended June 30, 2021, an immaterial number of shares were excluded from the computation of diluted earning per share as the effect would have been anti-dilutive. For the year ended June 30, 2020, the dilutive effect of approximately 45,000 outstanding RSAs, PSUs and NSOs have been excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share as the effect would have been anti-dilutive because of the net loss for the year ended June 30, 2020. For the year ended June 30, 2019, an immaterial number of shares were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share as the effect would have been anti-dilutive. 13. SEGMENT INFORMATION Operating segments are identified as components of an enterprise about which discrete financial information is available for evaluation by the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) in making decisions on how to allocate resources and assess performance. Through June 30, 2021, the Company’s CODM regularly assessed the operating performance of the Company’s boat brands under three operating and reportable segments: • The MasterCraft segment produces boats under two product brands, MasterCraft and Aviara. MasterCraft boats are produced at the Company’s Vonore, Tennessee facility. These are premium recreational performance sport boats primarily used for water skiing, wakeboarding, wake surfing, and general recreational boating. Aviara boats are luxury day boats primarily used for general recreational boating. Production of Aviara boats began during the year ended June 30, 2019 and the Company began selling these boats in July 2019. The Company has transitioned Aviara production from the Vonore facility to the Merritt Island, Florida facility as of the end of March 2021, allowing for increased production capacity for our MasterCraft branded products. • The NauticStar segment produces boats at its Amory, Mississippi facility. NauticStar’s boats are primarily used for saltwater fishing and general recreational boating. • The Crest segment produces pontoon boats at its Owosso, Michigan facility. Crest’s boats are primarily used for general recreational boating. Each segment distributes its products through its own independent dealer network. Each segment also has its own management structure which is responsible for the operations of the segment and is directly accountable to the CODM for the operating performance of the segment, which is regularly assessed by the CODM who allocates resources based on that performance, including using measures of performance based operating income. The Company files a consolidated income tax return and does not allocate income taxes and other corporate-level expenses, including interest, to operating segments. All material corporate costs are allocated to the MasterCraft segment. Selected financial information for the Company’s reportable segments was as follows: For the Year Ended June 30, 2021 MasterCraft NauticStar Crest Consolidated Net sales $ 363,274 $ 59,846 $ 102,688 $ 525,808 Operating income (loss) 65,038 ( 2,690 ) 13,605 75,953 Depreciation and amortization 5,865 3,262 2,503 11,630 Purchases of property, plant and equipment 24,327 2,643 892 27,862 F-28 For the Year Ended June 30, 2020 MasterCraft NauticStar Crest Consolidated Net sales $ 246,455 $ 54,930 $ 61,688 $ 363,073 Operating income (loss) 33,229 ( 17,681 ) ( 42,115 ) ( 26,567 ) Depreciation and amortization 4,679 3,454 2,394 10,527 Goodwill and other intangible asset impairment — 13,199 43,238 56,437 Purchases of property, plant and equipment 6,193 2,804 5,244 14,241 For the Year Ended June 30, 2019 MasterCraft NauticStar Crest (a) Consolidated Net sales $ 311,830 $ 77,995 76,556 $ 466,381 Operating income (loss) 53,989 ( 27,785 ) 7,055 33,259 Depreciation and amortization 3,481 2,684 1,622 7,787 Goodwill and other intangible asset impairment — 31,000 — 31,000 Purchases of property, plant and equipment 11,730 2,069 265 14,064 (a) Crest was acquired on October 1, 2018.

BASIS OF P RESENTATION Our fiscal year begins on July 1 and ends on June 30 with the interim quarterly reporting periods consisting of thirteen weeks. Therefore, the quarter end will not always coincide with the date of the end of the calendar month. We refer to our fiscal years based on the calendar-year in which they end. Accordingly, references to fiscal 2020, fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 represent our financial results for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2020, June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018, respectively. For ease of reference, we identify our fiscal years in this Form 10-K by reference to the period from July 1 to June 30 of the year in which the fiscal year ends. For example, “fiscal 2020” refers to our fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. MasterCraft Boat Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”), a Delaware corporation, operates primarily through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, MasterCraft Boat Company, LLC, MasterCraft Services, LLC, MasterCraft Parts, Ltd., and MasterCraft International Sales Administration, Inc (collectively “MasterCraft”); Nautic Star, LLC and NS Transport, LLC (collectively “NauticStar”); and Crest Marine, LLC (“Crest”). Unless the context otherwise requires, the Company and its subsidiaries collectively are referred to as the “Company”, “we”, or “us” in this Form 10-K. 1 PART I ITEM 1. BUSINESS We are a leading designer, manufacturer, and marketer of recreational powerboats sold under four brands – MasterCraft, NauticStar, Crest, and Aviara. We operate under three operating and reportable segments: MasterCraft, NauticStar, and Crest. The MasterCraft segment includes both our MasterCraft and Aviara brands. Our MasterCraft brand is a world-renowned innovator, designer, manufacturer, and marketer of premium performance sport boats, with a leading market position in the U.S., and a strong international presence consisting of dealers in 37 countries around the world. MasterCraft boats are used for water skiing, wakeboarding, wake surfing, as well as general recreational boating. We believe that MasterCraft is the most recognized brand name in the performance sport boat category. In October 2017 we acquired NauticStar, a leading manufacturer and distributor of high-quality outboard bay boats, deck boats and offshore center console boats. NauticStar’s product portfolio provides diversification and expands our direct addressable market into the outboard category, the largest powerboat industry category in terms of retail units, according to the National Marine Manufacturers Association (“NMMA”). In October 2018 we acquired Crest, a leading manufacturer of pontoon boats, providing us with additional product diversification and direct addressable market expansion. The pontoon category is also one of the fastest growing segments in the powerboat industry and participates in the outboard category. In February 2019 we introduced a new brand, Aviara, specifically designed, engineered and manufactured to meet the exacting specifications of consumers seeking the ultimate luxury recreational day boat experience. The brand’s first model, the AV32, began selling during the first quarter of 2020 and the AV36 began selling during the second quarter of 2020. In February 2020, we launched the third Aviara model, the AV40, which we expect to begin selling in the first half of fiscal 2021. With three models ranging from 32 – 40 feet in length, using both outboard and sterndrive propulsion, the Aviara brand continues our track record of product diversification and addressable market expansion, both through acquisitions and utilization of our in-house product development capabilities. Aviara is built in our MasterCraft facility and is part of the MasterCraft reportable segment. Through our four brands, we operate in three of the fastest growing segments of the powerboat industry — performance sport boats, outboard saltwater fishing and pontoon boats — while entering the large, growing luxury day boat segment. We are committed to delivering an extraordinary boating experience to our consumers. From pioneering innovations that improve enjoyment on the water to offering products that promote rapid development of skills, our mission is to help our consumers generate memories that will last a lifetime. We utilize a comprehensive product development process in order to build the most relevant and exciting products for our consumers, year after year. We believe that our commitment to quality is unsurpassed, and we engage in operational excellence to deploy flexible and effective production systems that ensure we design and build the highest quality boats in the market. All of our boats, from hull to upholstery, are hand-crafted by our skilled workforce at our corporate headquarters near Knoxville, Tennessee, and our facilities in Amory, Mississippi and Owosso, Michigan. In recent years, we have made significant investments in improving design, engineering, manufacturing, and operational processes as we strive to be the most efficient boat manufacturer in the industry. We believe our MasterCraft facility is the only boat manufacturing plant to achieve compliance with all three of the International Standard for Organization (“ISO”) 9001 (Quality Management Systems), 14001 (Environmental Management Systems), and 18001 (International Occupational Health and Safety Management System) standards. MasterCraft’s industry-leading operations result in world-class quality, which enables us to offer a five-year factory warranty and results in MasterCraft boats typically maintaining higher aftermarket resale value than our competitors’ boats. We sell our boats through an extensive network of independent dealers in North America and internationally. Our MasterCraft boats are the exclusive performance sport boats offered by the majority of our dealers. Since the acquisitions of NauticStar and Crest, and the introduction of our Aviara brand, we have expanded our dealer network over the past years. We devote significant time and resources to find, develop, and improve the performance of our dealers. We continuously cultivate and strengthen our dealer relationships with marketing, training, and service programs designed to increase our dealers’ sales and profitability. We believe the strength of our dealer network and our proactive efforts to help our dealers improve their businesses give us a distinct competitive advantage in our industry. 2 Our History MasterCraft was founded in 1968 when we built our first custom hull ski boat in a two-stall horse barn on a farm in Maryville, Tennessee. Dissatisfied with the large wakes and pull of other ski boats, we designed a hull that had the smallest wake in the industry: smooth and low at slalom and jump speeds yet well-defined at trick speeds. Our roots in performance water ski boats were reinforced as we evolved over the next 50 years to produce leading performance-oriented boats in the wakeboarding and wake surfing categories. Today, we continue to produce the industry’s premier competitive water ski, wakeboarding, and wake surfing performance boats that also address our consumers’ needs for versatility, flexibility, fun, and functionality. NauticStar, which we acquired in October 2017, was founded in 2002 and is located in Amory, Mississippi. With many years of boat manufacturing experience, and a 200,000 square-foot manufacturing facility, NauticStar has a reputation for reliability, quality and consistency, with a loyal network of dealers and consumers including professional and sport fishermen, and recreational and pleasure boating enthusiasts. Crest, which we acquired in October 2018, was founded in 1957 and is located on approximately 55 acres in Owosso, Michigan. With nearly 150,000 square feet of manufacturing floor space, Crest is one of the top producers of innovative, high-quality pontoon boats ranging from 20 to 29 feet. Aviara is a de novo brand, developed in-house, and focused on serving the luxury recreational day boat segment of the powerboat industry. Introduced at the Miami Boat Show in February 2019, Aviara currently features three models utilizing both outboard and sterndrive propulsion. The brand’s first model, the AV32 began selling during the first quarter of 2020 and the AV36 began selling during the second quarter of 2020. In February 2020, we launched the third Aviara model, the AV40, which we expect to begin selling in the first half of fiscal 2021. Aviara creates an elevated open water experience by fusing progressive style and effortless comfort in its modern luxury vessels. Our Market Opportunity During calendar 2019, retail sales of new powerboats in the U.S. totaled $11.0 billion. Of the powerboat categories tracked by the NMMA, our MasterCraft brand corresponds most directly to the inboard ski/wakeboard category, which we refer to as the performance sport boat category. The category that most directly corresponds to our NauticStar and Crest brand is the outboard category. Aviara directly corresponds to the outboard and sterndrive categories. Given our product diversification driven by acquisitions and internal product development, we believe our addressable market also includes similar and adjacent powerboat categories identified by the NMMA, including inboard cruiser boats and jet boats. We believe we are well-positioned to benefit from several trends underway in our addressable market, including: • performance sport boats are taking a greater share of the overall fiberglass powerboat category; • outboard boats are taking a greater share of the overall powerboat category; • premium bowriders between 30’ – 40’ in length, both outboard and sterndrive, are taking a greater share of the overall fiberglass powerboat category; and • ease-of-use and performance innovations have accelerated product cycles driving consumer demand for new products. In addition, as a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic, consumers have been turning to boating as a safe recreational alternative that allows for social distancing while enjoying the outdoors. However, our marketplace continues to evolve as a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic and could change further in the future. Please see Item 1A, “Risk Factors – Risks Relating to Our Business – The COVID-19 Pandemic has had, and may continue to have, certain negative impacts on our business and those of our consumers, dealers and suppliers, and such impacts may have a material adverse effect on our operations and business.” According to the NMMA, new unit sales of performance sport boats in the U.S. increased at a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 9.7% from calendar 2015 to 2019 while new unit sales of all outboard boats grew at a CAGR of 4.3% in the U.S. over the same period. Total new unit sales of powerboats in the U.S. (excluding personal watercraft and jet boats) increased at a CAGR of 3.9% from 2015 to 2019. We believe the performance sport boat and outboard boat categories have grown at a faster rate than the rest of the powerboat industry due to increased innovation in the features, designs, and layouts of performance sport boats and outboard propulsion boats. These innovations have improved the performance, functionality, and versatility of these boats as compared with other recreational boats, particularly boats in the sterndrive category, which have not experienced the same degree of innovation. We believe inboard boats are superior to sterndrive boats for tow sports such as water skiing, wakeboarding, and wake surfing for several reasons, including (i) the larger and more propulsive wakes that only inboard engine configurations can enable, (ii) enhanced rider safety as a result of the location of the inboard propeller underneath the boat instead of protruding from the stern, as is generally the case with boats in the sterndrive category, and (iii) relatively more passenger and storage space due to the location of the inboard engine housing. We believe outboard boats are superior to sterndrive boats for recreational boating uses such as fishing and family boating for several reasons, including (i) relatively more passenger and storage space due to the location of the outboard engine housing, (ii) engine noise is significantly reduced in an outboard engine compared to a sterndrive engine, (iii) outboard engines are easier to access and maintain compared to a sterndrive engine, and (iv) outboard engines perform better and have greater durability in saltwater conditions. 3 The expanding popularity of boating has also contributed to the strong volumes. We believe we are well-positioned to benefit from the increased popularity of recreational boating and the resulting larger prospective consumer base. Our Strengths Iconic MasterCraft Brand Synonymous with Quality, Innovation, and Performance. We believe the MasterCraft brand is well-known among boating enthusiasts for high performance, premier quality, and relentless innovation. We believe that the market recognizes MasterCraft as a premier brand in the powerboat industry due to the overall superior value proposition that our boats deliver to our consumers. The MasterCraft brand is built on a carefully crafted set of defining principles, including Legacy, Power, Precision and Progression. We work tirelessly every day to maintain our iconic brand reputation relative to our competition. The rigorous attention to detail with which we design and manufacture our products results in high quality boats that command significant resale premiums to comparable competitor boats. Leading Market Share Position in Performance Sport Boat, Outboard, and Pontoon Categories. In recent history, we have consistently held a leading market share position in the U.S. among manufacturers of premium performance sport boats based on unit volume. According to the Statistical Surveys, Inc. (“SSI”), our performance sport boat U.S. market share in December 2019 was 21.6%. Per SSI, our U.S. market share for deck boats and saltwater fishing boats in the 15’ – 35’ segment, sold by our NauticStar brand, was 4.5%. Per SSI, Crest’s pontoon boat market share was 3.6%. As of December 2019, based on SSI data, MasterCraft has the #1 market share, by brand, in the performance sport boat segment; NauticStar has the #6 market share, by brand, in the highly-fragmented deck and saltwater fishing segment; and Crest has the #8 market share, by brand, in the highly-fragmented pontoon segment. We believe our sales will grow as dealers and consumers continue to recognize the superior quality, performance, styling, and value of our recently released boats and that we are just starting to realize the market share benefits of the many recent new product offerings and product enhancement initiatives that our management team has implemented during the past several years. Industry-Leading Product Design and Innovation. We believe that our innovation in the design of new boat models and new features has been a key to our success, helping us maintain our market share, command higher price points, and generally broaden the appeal of our products among recreational and fishing boaters. As a result of the features we have introduced, we believe that our boats are used for an increasingly wide range of activities. Our commitment to consistently developing new boat models and introducing new features is reflected in several notable recent achievements, including NMMA Innovation Awards for our MasterCraft ProStar water skiing boat, Gen 2 integrated surf system, X24 performance tow boat, and the DockStar Handling System. Our entire MasterCraft product portfolio has been renewed in the past five years, giving us the newest overall product offering in the performance sport boat category. Since acquiring NauticStar, we have introduced several new models, with future plans to introduce several new models over the coming years. At Crest, we are designing and engineering new models that we believe will drive innovation in the pontoon segment. Our Aviara brand, designed and engineered completely in-house, features several new innovations that we plan to introduce to the marketplace over the coming years. Highly Efficient Product Development and Manufacturing. We believe that a key to our success has been our renewed focus on operational improvements and world-class business processes. We believe our new product development capabilities are industry-leading and enable us to consistently create unique high-performance hull shapes and product features in shorter design iterations and at lower development costs than our competitors. These capabilities enable us to precisely design custom hulls and performance features that enhance each boat’s unique performance characteristics and increase our speed to market with exciting new products. Our acquisition of NauticStar and Crest allows us to leverage this internal product development and manufacturing expertise to capitalize on operational improvement opportunities at our Amory, Mississippi and Owosso, Michigan facilities. Our Aviara brand, which is built in our existing MasterCraft facility, has benefited from the industry-leading quality, safety, and manufacturing process we have in place there. Strong Dealer Network. We have worked extensively with our dealers to develop what we believe is one of the strongest dealer networks in the performance sport boat and outboard categories. We target our distribution to the market segments’ highest performing dealers. We have established operating processes focused on optimizing dealers’ financial performance and service, and with a track record of balancing wholesale inventory and retail sales we are better able to monitor dealer inventory, allowing for more transparent sales estimates and strong dealer relationships. Transparent and thorough warranty programs encourage consumers to continue to visit our dealers for servicing, creating additional opportunities for boat trade-ins and purchases of accessories, thereby improving our dealers’ sales rates and financial health. These actions have strengthened our existing dealer network and are driving increased interest from new potential dealers who want to join the MasterCraft, NauticStar and Crest platforms. For our Aviara brand, we have partnered with MarineMax, the largest marine dealership in the U.S., to market our luxury recreational day boats. We believe introducing a new brand with an established dealer base provides the Aviara brand with instant credibility and the greatest opportunity for long-term success in the marketplace. 4 Differentiated Sales and Marketing Capabilities. We believe our marketing efforts support each of our brand promises by focusing on superior value proposition and differentiating the performance and features of our boats. Our marketing efforts are conducted using an array of strategies, which include d igital advertising, social media engagement, advertisements in endemic media and the sponsorship of boating and water sport events. To highlight our MasterCraft performance credibility and generate additional brand excitement, we sponsor a number of nation ally ranked athletes , and social influencers . We believe our superior sales and marketing capabilities effectively communicate our performance, styling, quality, authenticity, and lifestyle, resulting in increased overall consumer engagement. Highly Experienced Executive Team. We have a highly seasoned and effective executive team. With extensive boating industry experience, our management team has proven its ability to develop and integrate new product lines, enhance operations, strengthen our distribution network, and recruit industry talent. Senior management additions over the past few years have driven improvements to our manufacturing, quality, and product development systems and processes, which have collectively accelerated performance improvements. Our Chief Executive Officer, Frederick Brightbill, has nearly 20 years of boating industry experience and has served as a member of our Board of Directors since 2009, including as Chairman since 2015. On December 3rd, 2019, Mr. Brightbill was appointed as the permanent Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Brightbill previously served as President of the Aluminum Boat Group at Brunswick Corporation and in various leadership roles at Mercury Marine, including President of the Outboard Business Unit and Integrated Operations Division. Tim Oxley, our Chief Financial Officer, has spent 30 years in the boating industry, including 14 years with the Company, following 16 years with Brunswick Corporation where he served as Chief Financial Officer of several operating divisions. In addition to Messrs. Brightbill and Oxley, the other members of our senior leadership team, collectively, have over 115 years of experience in the boating industry. Our Strategy Continue to Develop New and Innovative Products. As a leading innovator, designer, manufacturer, and marketer, we strive to design new and inventive products that appeal to a broad consumer base for all of our premium brands. Since fiscal 2013, we have successfully launched a number of new products and features with best-in-class quality leading to increased sales and significant margin expansion. Our process involves each department in collaborative full “team” product launches that enable us to release several new models per year, per brand, while maintaining superior quality and controlling costs. Product development and innovation are the life blood of successful boat manufacturers and we will continue to invest significant resources to ensure a pipeline of new products to meet the needs of our consumers. Capture Additional Share from Adjacent Boating Categories. Our NauticStar, Crest, and Aviara brands provide us with direct access to the outboard and sterndrive categories, with outboards representing the largest category of the powerboat industry with $7.7 billion of sales in 2019, per the NMMA, and provides diversification from our existing MasterCraft product portfolio. The additions of NauticStar, Crest, and Aviara, combined with our culture of innovation, enhances our ability to introduce new products with increased versatility, functionality, and performance to a more expansive consumer base that values boats for competitive and recreational fishing, and general recreational boating purposes. Ultimately, the versatile boating experience delivered by our brands allows us to attract consumers from other boating categories, most notably from the sterndrive categories. We intend to further enhance the performance, comfort, and versatility of our products to target additional consumers seeking high performance water sport, fishing and general recreational activity. Effectively Monitor Dealer Inventory and Further Strengthen Our Dealer Network. Our goal is to achieve and maintain a leading market share in each of the markets in which we operate. We view our dealers as our partners and product champions. Therefore, we devote significant time and resources to finding high quality dealers and developing and improving their performance over time. We actively monitor field inventory levels, as demonstrated by healthy and consistent inventory retail turns and balanced wholesale and retail unit sales, which leads to better margins and improved financial health for our dealers. Additionally, our predictable new product development cycles across our portfolio ensure that our dealers have high quality, compelling, and relevant products to sell to their customers. We believe the quality and trust in our dealer relationships are more beneficial to our long-term success than the quantity of dealers. We continue to leverage that dealer base while proactively developing strategies that will strengthen our overall network. For example, we intend to strengthen our current footprint by selectively recruiting market-leading dealers. We believe our targeted initiatives to enhance and grow our dealer network will increase unit sales in the future. Continued Focus on Sales in International Markets. We currently have an extensive international dealer network with 66 international locations in 37 countries around the world. We believe MasterCraft is the most well-known brand in the performance sport boat category globally, and that NauticStar, Crest, and Aviara have the potential for global growth. Based on our brand recognition, innovative product offerings, and distribution strengths, we believe we are well positioned to leverage our reputation and capture additional international sales. Continuing retaliatory tariffs in the European Union and unfavorable exchange rates in other parts of the world are a current headwind. We believe that we will maintain our international sales by promoting our new products in developed markets where we have a well-established dealer base. Net sales outside of North America represented 4.8% of net sales in fiscal 2020. Our Products We design, manufacture, and sell premium recreational performance sport boats, outboard, and sterndrive boats that we believe deliver superior performance for water skiing, wakeboarding, wake surfing, and fishing, as well as general recreational boating. In addition, we 5 offer various accessories , including trailers and aftermarket parts. We market our boats under four brands: MasterCraft , NauticStar , Crest , and Aviara . Our MasterCraft portfolio of ProStar, XStar, X, XT and NXT models are designed for the highest levels of performance, styling, and enjoyment for both recreational and competitive use. The XStar and X models are geared towards the consumer seeking the most premium and highest performance boating experience that we offer, and generally command a price premium over our competitors’ boats at retail prices ranging from approximately $160,000 to $190,000. The MasterCraft XT models were introduced in July 2016 with retail prices ranging from approximately $100,000 to $140,000. Unveiled in January 2014, the MasterCraft NXT models introduced the quality, performance, styling, and innovation of the MasterCraft brand to the entry-level consumer, with retail prices ranging from approximately $ 75,000 to $95,000. We have strategically designed and priced the MasterCraft NXT models to target the fast-growing entry-level consumer group that is distinct from our traditional consumer base, while maintaining our core MasterCraft brand attributes at profit margins comparable to our other offerings. Our NauticStar portfolio of Bay Boats, Sport Deck Boats and Offshore Boats are designed for a variety of uses, including recreational and competitive sport fishing in freshwater lakes or saltwater, and general recreational enjoyment. NauticStar’s Bay Boats and Offshore Boats are geared towards the consumer seeking unmatched quality and features for fishability and family friendly comfort. The Sport Deck Boat line caters to consumers seeking the drive and ride of a V-hull, large capacity, and the styling and efficiency of a runabout. NauticStar’s retail prices range from approximately $35,000 to $300,000. We believe all of the NauticStar models represent a tremendous value for consumers. Our Crest portfolio of pontoon boats are designed for the ultimate in comfort and recreational pleasure boating. Crest has continued to grow market share as it expands its distribution footprint. Crest’s pontoon boats are designed to offer consumers the best in luxury, style and performance without compromise across a diverse product portfolio. Crest’s retail prices range from approximately $30,000 to $160,000. Our Aviara portfolio of luxury recreational day boats was designed in-house with the vision to create pleasure crafts that defy compromise. The Aviara brand drew on MasterCraft’s 50-year legacy of quality and is built in our award-winning MasterCraft facility. Aviara’s boat designs were inspired by our four product design principles – Progressive Style, Elevated Control, Modern Comfort and Quality Details. Aviara’s models consist of the AV32, a 32-foot luxury bowrider, the AV36, a 36-foot luxury bowrider, and the AV40, the brand’s flagship 40-foot luxury bowrider for the ultimate on-the-water experience. All models are available in either outboard or sterndrive propulsion, and Aviara’s retail prices range from approximately $345,000 to $670,000. Our Dealer Network We rely on an extensive network of independent dealers to sell our products in North America and internationally. For MasterCraft, NauticStar, Crest, and Aviara, we target our distribution to the market segment’s highest performing dealers. The majority of our MasterCraft dealers are exclusive to our MasterCraft product lines within the performance sport boat category, highlighting the commitment of our key dealers to the MasterCraft brand. We establish performance criteria that our dealers must meet as part of their dealer agreements to ensure the continued quality of our dealer network. As members of our network, dealers may qualify for wholesale rebates, retail rebates and promotions, floor plan reimbursement or cash discounts, and other allowances. We consistently review our distribution network to identify opportunities to expand our geographic footprint and improve our coverage of the market. We constantly monitor the health and strength of our dealers by analyzing each dealer’s retail sales and inventory and have established processes to identify underperforming dealers in order to assist them in improving their performance or to allow us to switch to a more effective dealer. These processes also allow us to better monitor dealer inventory levels and product turns and contribute to a healthier dealer network that is better able to stock and sell our products. We believe our outstanding dealer network and our proactive approach to dealer management allow us to distribute our products more efficiently than our competitors and will help us capitalize on growth opportunities as our industry volumes continue to increase. For fiscal 2020 the Company’s top ten dealers accounted for approximately 30% of our net sales and none of our dealers accounted for more than 5% of our total net sales. North America. In North America, our MasterCraft brand, had a total of 132 dealers across 141 locations as of June 30, 2020. Our NauticStar brand had a total of 67 dealers across 82 locations in North America as of June 30, 2020. Our Crest brand had a total of 116 dealers across 130 locations in North America as of June 30, 2020. We do not have a significant concentration of sales among our MasterCraft, NauticStar or Crest dealers. Our Aviara brand is sold through a distribution network consisting of one dealer with 59 locations. Outside of North America. As of June 30, 2020, through our MasterCraft brand, we had a total of 41 international dealers and 41 locations and through our NauticStar brand we had eight international dealers in 41 locations. We are present in Europe, Australia, Africa, Asia, including Hong Kong and the Middle East. We generated 4.8%, 5.2%, and 7.5% of our net sales outside of North America in fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. 6 Dealer Relations We have developed a system of financial incentives for our dealers based on achievement of key benchmarks. In addition, we provide our dealers with comprehensive sales training and a complete set of technology-based tools designed to help dealers maximize performance. Our dealer incentive program has been refined through years of experience with some of the key elements including wholesale rebates, retail rebates and promotions, other allowances, and floor plan reimbursement or cash discounts to encourage balanced production throughout the year. Beyond our incentive programs, we have developed a proprietary web-based management tool that is used by our dealers on a day-to-day basis to improve their own businesses as well as enhance communication with our factory and sales management teams. Our business-to-business application efficiently executes many critical functions, including warranty registrations, warranty claims, boat ordering and tracking, parts ordering, technical support, and inventory reporting. This system facilitates communication between our sales team and the dealer network and allows our manufacturing department to review consumer demand in real time. Sales Cycles and Floor Plan Financing We manage our annual sales plan through distinct buying periods. Our rebates are tiered so that dealers have a financial incentive to take the stocking risk for boats purchased prior to the traditional retail selling season (April - June). These incentives, accompanied by floor plan subsidies for up to nine months from the date of invoice, drive “level loading” of production. During this first part of the model year, many of the dealers’ orders are standard configurations for their showrooms. In the second part of the model year, more boats are customized by retail consumers. Many of these custom orders are placed during boat shows, which typically occur from January through early April across North America. We offer our dealers the opportunity to purchase boats with cash or through floor plan financing programs with third-party floor plan financing providers. The floor plan financing programs allow dealers to establish lines of credit with third-party lenders to purchase inventory. Upon purchase of a boat, dealers draw on the floor plan facility and the lenders pay the invoice price of the boat directly to us typically within 5 business days. Consistent with industry practice, we offer various manufacturer-sponsored floor plan interest programs under which we agree to reimburse our dealers for certain floor plan interest costs incurred for up to nine months from the date of invoice. In some cases, cash discounts are offered as an alternative to floor plan subsidies. These programs encourage dealers to rapidly replenish inventories during the spring and summer retail season, maintain sufficient inventories during the non-peak season, and balance wholesale purchases throughout the year. Pursuant to the terms of the floor plan financing, if a dealer defaults on the terms of its credit line, we agree to repurchase new inventory repossessed from dealerships. Our obligation to repurchase such repossessed products for the unpaid balance of our original invoice price for the boat is subject to reduction or limitation based on the age and condition of the boat at the time of repurchase, and in certain cases, by an aggregate cap on repurchase obligations associated with a particular floor plan financing program. We incurred no material impact from repurchase events during fiscal 2020, 2019, or 2018. Marketing and Sales Marketing We believe that our differentiated marketing capabilities and our multi-channel, content-driven marketing strategies align with our strategic focus on product innovation, performance, and quality to attract aspiring and enthusiast consumers to our brands and products. These sales and marketing efforts allow us to more effectively launch and support our products, help drive actionable sales leads for our dealers, and reinforce our MasterCraft, NauticStar, Crest, and Aviara brand and lifestyle attributes. Our over 50-year history of manufacturing and design leadership has made MasterCraft one of the most well-known and iconic brands in the boating industry. We believe the MasterCraft brand is widely recognized even among non-enthusiasts. Similarly, Crest’s nearly 60-year history has led to the brand being strongly recognized within the boating industry. Our NauticStar brand is relatively young compared to MasterCraft but has quickly established itself as a strong brand dedicated to innovation, style and quality. We are focused on enhancing the power of our brands through a multifaceted marketing strategy. Our addressable market is targeted through a variety of specialized means, ranging from event sponsorships to far-reaching strategic alliances. We have created a unified print and digital advertising strategy that is refreshed each year, featuring the unique attributes of each of our products while maintaining focus on the MasterCraft, NauticStar, Crest, and Aviara brands. We maintain a meaningful presence for our product lines in several endemic water sports and boating publications. Given the prevalence of our products in the markets these publications target, we also benefit from significant unpaid impressions in these industry publications, as our boats frequently appear in feature stories and advertisements for other products. In addition to these traditional marketing channels, in the last several years we have 7 created an active and highly successful digital advertising and social media platform, including the use of Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, and Vimeo , among others, to deliver content to our target audience, increase awareness of our brands, foster loyalty, and build a community of MasterCraft , NauticStar , Crest and Aviara enthusiasts . In addition, we benefit from numerous user-generated videos and photos that are uploaded to these websites and social media platforms . An important component of this strategy has been our investment in our own mastercraft.com , nauticstarboats.com , crestpontoonboats.com , and aviaraboa t s.com websites. The sites are designed to allow significant interaction between us and our consumer base through marketing content delivery, message boards, news and event postings, and product updates and specification s. Our popular “Design-a-Boat” functionality allows consumers to design a customized boat and request a dealer quote. The custom design can be transmitted directly to our closest independent dealer as well as our in-house concierge who follows up directly with our dealer leads for MasterCraft and Aviara . Our leading position in the performance sport boat category is further supported by our sponsorship of some of the most recognizable and successful athletes and influencers in water sports, as well as a number of highly visible competitions and events around the world. Our activities in this area serve to deepen the penetration of our brands within the professional and enthusiast community, while also supporting the growth of watersports. The events which we sponsor and in which we and our dealers participate feature the most popular figures in wakeboarding and water skiing, drawing large audiences of enthusiasts to a variety of sites around the country. Furthermore, we sponsor top ranked professional wakeboarding athletes, water ski jumpers, and water skiers. In addition to the advertising generated by the athletes’ success in their sports, we also leverage our sponsorship of these athletes by having them attend boat shows and dealer events and appear in creative media events, in which they garner public relations interest, build our MasterCraft brand, and in many cases help sell our products directly to consumers. Sales Our sales organization’s primary role is to monitor our network of existing dealers and work with them to increase sales of our products, as well as identifying and recruiting new and replacement dealers that we believe will provide enhanced sales and customer service for our end consumers. We employ proactive processes to monitor the health and performance of our dealers, and to help them improve their businesses and their sales of our products. Our strategy is to improve the individual market shares of each of our dealers in their respective markets, and to add new dealers in new markets or replace dealers in existing markets where we believe we can achieve improved market share and customer service. We utilize regular performance reviews to drive improvement in underperforming dealers and to determine how to transition to new dealers when necessary. In addition, we employ a number of tools to assist our dealers in improving their performance, including product, sales, and service training, marketing materials and content, and direct interaction with prospective consumers such as our factory concierge service. We encourage and expect our sales representatives to serve as advisors to our dealers, and believe this proactive sales approach leads to better dealer relationships and higher sales of our products. Manufacturing All of our MasterCraft and Aviara boats are designed, manufactured, and lake-tested in our Vonore, Tennessee facility. All of our NauticStar boats are manufactured in our Amory, Mississippi facility. All of our Crest boats are manufactured in our Owosso, Michigan facility. We believe MasterCraft has the only boat manufacturing facility to achieve compliance with all three of the ISO 9001 (Quality Management Systems), 14001 (Environmental Management Systems), and 18001 (International Occupational Health and Safety Management System) standards. The rigorous attention to detail in the design and manufacturing of our products results in boats of high quality which affords our customers a great on water experience across all of our brands. Our dedication to quality allows us to offer some of the longest and most inclusive warranty terms in the industry allowing our customers to enjoy our products with confidence. Our boats are built through a continuous flow manufacturing process that encompasses fabrication, assembly, quality management, and testing. We manufacture certain components and subassemblies for our boats, such as upholstery, and procure other components from third-party vendors and install them on the boat. We have several exclusive supplier partnerships for critical purchased components, such as aluminum billet, towers, and engine packages. For MasterCraft, we also build custom trailers that match the exact size and color of our boats. Research and Development, Product Development and Engineering We are strategically and financially committed to innovation, as reflected in our dedicated product development and engineering groups and evidenced by our track record of new product introduction. At MasterCraft and Aviara, our product development and engineering group comprises 24 professionals. At NauticStar, our product development and engineering group comprises five professionals. At Crest, our product development and engineering group comprises five professionals. These individuals bring to our product development efforts significant expertise across core disciplines, including boat design, computer-aided design, naval engineering, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering. They are responsible for execution of all facets of our new product strategy, starting with design and development of new boat models and innovative features, engineering these designs for manufacturing, and integrating 8 new boats and innovations into production without disruption, at high quality, on time and on budget. Our product development and engineering functions work closely with our Strategic Portfolio Management Team which includes senior leadership from Sales, Marketing and Finance, all working together to develop our long-term p roduct and innovation strategies. We take a disciplined approach to the management of our product development strategy. We have structured processes to obtain voices of the consumer, dealer, and management to guide our long-term product lifecycle and portfolio planning. In addition, extensive testing and coordination with our manufacturing group are important elements of our product development process, which we believe enable us to leverage the lessons from past launches and minimize the risk associated with the release of new products. We have developed a strategy to launch several new models a year, which will allow us to renew our product portfolio with innovative offerings at a rate that we believe will be difficult for our competitors to match without significant additional capital investments. In addition to our new product strategy, we manage a separate innovation development process which allows us to design innovative new features for our boats in a disciplined manner and to launch these innovations in a more rapid time frame and with higher quality. These enhanced processes have reduced the time to market for our new product pipeline. Our research and product development expense for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $5.2 million, $5.6 million, and $4.9 million, respectively. Intellectual Property We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, and copyright protection, trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, and contractual provisions to protect our rights in our brands, products, and proprietary technology. We also protect our vessel hull designs through vessel hull design registrations. This is an important part of our business and we intend to continue protecting our intellectual property. We currently hold 34 U.S. patents and six foreign patents, including utility and design patents for our transom surf seating, our DockStar handling system, and our Gen 2 surf system technology. Provided that we comply with all statutory maintenance requirements, our patents are expected to expire between 2021 and 2037. We also have 14 pending U.S. patent applications and ten pending foreign patent applications. We also own in excess of 100 trademark registrations in various countries around the world, most notably for the MasterCraft, NauticStar, Crest, and Aviara names and/or logos, as well as numerous model names in MasterCraft’s Star Series, X, XT, and NXT product families, and we have several pending applications for additional registrations. Such trademarks may endure in perpetuity on a country-by-country basis provided that we comply with all statutory maintenance requirements, including continued use of each trademark in each such country. In addition, we own 38 registered U.S. copyrights. Finally, we have registered more than 40 vessel hull designs with the U.S. Copyright Office, the most recent of which will remain in force through 2027. From time to time, we are involved in intellectual property litigation, either accusing third parties of infringing our intellectual property rights, or defending against third-party claims that we are infringing the intellectual property of others. We are not currently involved in any outstanding intellectual property litigation that we believe, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. However, we cannot predict the outcome of any pending or future litigation, and an unfavorable outcome could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Suppliers We purchase a wide variety of raw materials from our supplier base, including resins, fiberglass, aluminum and steel, as well as product parts and components such as engines and electronic controls. We maintain long-term contracts with preferred suppliers and informal arrangements with other suppliers. We are focused on working with our supply chain partners to enable cost improvement, world-class quality, and continuous product innovation. We have engaged our key suppliers in collaborative preferred supplier relationships and have developed processes including annual cost reduction targets, regular reliability projects, and extensive product testing requirements to ensure that our suppliers produce at lowest total cost and to the highest levels of quality expected of our brands. These collaborative efforts begin at the design stage, with our key suppliers integrated into design and development planning well in advance of launch, which allows us to control costs and to leverage the expertise of our suppliers in developing product innovations. We believe these collaborative relationships with our most important suppliers have contributed to our significant improvements in product quality, innovation, and profitability. The most significant components used in manufacturing our boats, based on cost, are engine packages. For our MasterCraft brand, Ilmor Engineering, Inc. (“Ilmor”) is MasterCraft’s exclusive engine supplier, and for our NauticStar brand, Yamaha Motor Corporation (“Yamaha”) is our largest engine supplier, while Mercury Marine (“Mercury”) is Crest’s largest engine supplier. For our Aviara brand, Mercury also provides outboard engines and Ilmor provides sterndrive engines. We maintain strong and long-standing relationships with Ilmor, Yamaha, and Mercury. During the year ended June 30, 2020, Ilmor was our largest overall supplier. In addition to performance sport boat and sterndrive engines, Ilmor’s affiliates produce engines used in a number of leading racing boats and race cars. Ilmor maintains a full-time customer service and warranty representative at our MasterCraft office, resulting in extremely efficient management of all engine-related matters, mitigating potential warranty risk. We work closely with Ilmor to remain at the forefront of engine design, performance, and manufacturing. Engine packages are the most expensive single component in the MasterCraft, Aviara, NauticStar and Crest boat-building process and we believe our long-term relationship with our engine supplier partners is a key competitive advantage. 9 Transportation We utilize third party logistics and transportation services along with a fleet of leased tractor trailers at NauticStar, to deliver our boats to our dealer network. A select few dealers near our manufacturing facilities have elected to manage transportation and arrange for boats to be picked up directly from our manufacturing facilities. International shipments are transferred to a third-party logistics provider who schedules them for shipment via ocean freight to their destination country. Information Technology We continue to make investments in information systems and technology. Our information systems and technology strategy support automation and integration of our business processes and strategic planning initiatives, including not only our internal information management and communications processes but also our marketing and dealer management efforts. Our Information Systems and Technology team is integral to our marketing and sales front office initiatives, helping us to develop stronger engagement between us, our dealers and our end consumers. We will continue to invest in our information systems and our IT infrastructure in order to leverage current and future technologies to support our product development, operations, and marketing strategies. Insurance and Product Warranties We purchase insurance to cover standard risks in our industry, including policies that cover general product liability, workers’ compensation, auto liability, and other casualty and property risks. Our insurance rates are based on our safety record as well as trends in the insurance industry. We also maintain workers’ compensation insurance and auto insurance policies that are retrospective in that the cost per year will vary depending on the frequency and severity of claims in the policy year. We face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that, among other things, the use of our products results in injury. With respect to product liability coverage, we carry customary insurance coverage. Our coverage involves self-insured retentions with primary and excess liability coverage above the retention amount. We have the ability to refer claims to our suppliers and their insurers to pay the costs associated with any claims arising from such suppliers’ products. Our insurance covers claims that are not adequately covered by a supplier’s insurance and provides for excess secondary coverage above the limits provided by our suppliers. We provide product warranties for all of our boat models. During the warranty period, we reimburse dealers and authorized service facilities for all or a portion of the cost of repair or replacement performed on the products. Some materials, components or parts of the boat that are not covered by our product warranties are separately warranted by their manufacturers or suppliers. These other warranties include warranties covering engines, among other components. Competition The powerboat industry, including the performance sport boat, outboard, and sterndrive categories, are highly fragmented, resulting in intense competition for consumers and dealers. Competition affects our ability to succeed in both the market segments we currently serve and new market segments that we may enter in the future. We compete with several large manufacturers that may have greater financial, marketing, and other resources than we do. We also compete with a wide variety of small privately held independent manufacturers. Competition in our industry is based primarily on brand name, price, innovative features, design, and product performance. Please see Item 1A, “Risk Factors” — Risks Related to Our Business — Our industry is characterized by intense competition, which affects our sales and profits. Seasonality Our operating results are subject to annual and seasonal fluctuations resulting from a variety of factors, including: • seasonal variations in retail demand for boats, with a significant majority of sales occurring during peak boating season, which we attempt to manage by providing incentive programs and floor plan subsidies to encourage dealer purchases throughout the year, which may include offering off-season retail promotions to our dealers in seasonally slow months, during and ahead of boat shows, to encourage retail demand; • product mix, which is driven by boat model mix and higher option order rates; while sales of all our boats generate comparable margins, sales of larger boats and boats with optional content generally produce higher absolute profits; • inclement weather, which can affect production at our manufacturing facilities as well as consumer demand; • competition from other recreational boat manufacturers; and • general economic conditions. 10 Environmental, Safety, and Regulatory Matters Our operations are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations, including those concerning product safety, environmental protection, and occupational health and safety. We believe that our operations and products are in compliance with these regulatory requirements. Historically, the cost of achieving and maintaining compliance with applicable laws and regulations has not been material. However, we cannot provide assurance that future costs and expenses required for us to comply with such laws and regulations, including any new or modified regulatory requirements, or to address newly discovered environmental conditions, will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, or cash flows. We have not been notified of and are otherwise currently not aware of any contamination at our current or former facilities for which we could be liable under environmental laws or regulations and we currently are not undertaking any remediation or investigation activities in connection with any contamination. However, future spills or accidents or the discovery of currently unknown conditions or non-compliances may give rise to investigation and remediation obligations or related liabilities and damage claims, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, or cash flows. The regulatory programs that impact our business include the following: Hazardous Substance and Waste Regulations Certain materials used in our manufacturing, including the resins used in production of our boats, are toxic, flammable, corrosive, or reactive and are classified by the federal and state governments as “hazardous materials.” Control of these substances is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and state pollution control agencies under the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and related state programs. Storage of these materials must be maintained in appropriately labeled and monitored containers, and disposal of wastes requires completion of detailed waste manifests and recordkeeping requirements. Any failure by us to properly store or dispose of our hazardous materials could result in liability, including fines, penalties, or obligations to investigate and remediate any contamination originating from our operations. OSHA The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Act imposes standards of conduct for and regulates workplace safety, including limits on the amount of emissions to which an employee may be exposed without the need for respiratory protection or upgraded plant ventilation. Our facilities are regularly inspected by OSHA and by state and local inspection agencies and departments. We believe that our facilities comply in all material aspects with these regulations. We have made a considerable investment in safety awareness programs and provide ongoing safety training for all of our employees. We have implemented a program that requires frequent safety inspections of our facilities by managers and an internal safety committee. The safety committee, which is led by a dedicated health and safety professional, prepares a monthly action plan based on its findings. Clean Air Act The Clean Air Act (the “CAA”) and corresponding state rules regulate emissions of air pollutants. Because our manufacturing operations involve molding and coating of fiberglass materials, which involves the emission of certain volatile organic compounds, hazardous air pollutants, and particulate matter, we are required to maintain and comply with a CAA operating permit (or “Title V” permit). Our Title V Permit requires us to monitor our emissions and periodically certify that our emissions are within specified limits. To date, we have not had material difficulty complying with those limits. In addition to the regulation of our manufacturing operations, the EPA has adopted regulations stipulating that many marine propulsion engines meet an air emission standard that requires fitting a catalytic converter to the engine. The engines used in our products, all of which are manufactured by third parties, are warranted by the manufacturers to be in compliance with the EPA’s emission standards. The additional cost of complying with these regulations has increased our cost to purchase the engines and, accordingly, has increased the cost to manufacture our products. If we are not able to pass these additional costs along to our consumers, it may have a negative impact on our business and financial condition. Boat Safety Standards Powerboats sold in the U.S. must be manufactured to meet the standards of certification required by the U.S. Coast Guard. In addition, boats manufactured for sale in the European Union must be certified to meet the European Union’s imported manufactured products standards. These certifications specify standards for the design and construction of powerboats. We believe that all our boats meet these standards. In addition, safety of recreational boats is subject to federal regulation under the Boat Safety Act of 1971, which requires boat manufacturers to recall products for replacement of parts or components that have demonstrated defects affecting safety. In the past, we 11 have instituted recalls for defective component parts produced by us or certain of our third-party suppliers. None of these r ecalls has had a material adverse effect on the Company. Employees We believe we maintain excellent relations with our employees, treating them as business partners and focusing on building their careers. We have approximately 884 employees as of June 30, 2020, 480 of whom work at our MasterCraft/Aviara facility in Tennessee, 218 of whom work at our NauticStar facility in Mississippi, and 186 of whom work at our Crest facility in Michigan. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and since MasterCraft’s founding in 1968, we have never experienced a labor-related work stoppage. Other Information We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware under the name MCBC Holdings, Inc. on January 28, 2000. In July 2015, we completed an initial public offering of our common stock. Effective November 7, 2018, the name of the Company was changed from MCBC Holdings, Inc. to MasterCraft Boat Holdings, Inc. We maintain a website with the address www.mastercraft.com. We are not including the information contained in our website as part of, or incorporating it by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We make available, free of charge through our website, our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to these reports as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file these materials with, or otherwise furnish them to, the SEC. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. RISK FACTORS Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as other information in this Form 10-K, before deciding whether to invest in shares of our common stock. The occurrence of any of the events described below could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects. In such an event, the trading price of our common stock may decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. Risks Relating to Our Business The COVID-19 Pandemic has had, and may continue to have, certain negative impacts on our business and those of our consumers, dealers and suppliers, and such impacts may have a material adverse effect on our operations and business. The COVID-19 Pandemic has significantly impacted worldwide economic conditions and could have a material adverse effect on our operations and business and those of our consumers, dealers and suppliers. In response to the COVID-19 Pandemic, governmental authorities, including in many of the jurisdictions in which we operate, have taken measures to limit the spread of the outbreak, including mandatory business closures, travel restrictions, quarantines, declarations of states of emergency, “stay-at-home” or “shelter-in-place” orders and social distancing protocols, in addition to seeking voluntary facility closures and other restrictions. These actions and the potential resurgence or enhancement of these actions could materially adversely affect our ability, and our consumers’, dealers’ and suppliers’ ability, to adequately staff, manage and maintain their respective businesses. Furthermore, our future results of operations, cash-flows and liquidity could be adversely impacted by the COVID-19 Pandemic due to delays in payments of outstanding receivable amounts beyond normal payment terms, supply chain disruptions, uncertain demand and additional goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges. To balance wholesale production with the then anticipated impacts to retail demand caused by the economic impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic, we reduced production in February 2020 and, in late March 2020, temporarily suspended manufacturing operations at all of our facilities to protect the health of our employees and comply with governmental mandated shutdowns. As a result of these actions, we temporarily laid off nearly all our hourly workforce. We paid lump sum severance payments to certain of our laid off employees and provided for the temporary continuation of their healthcare benefits, resulting in charges totaling approximately $1.4 million during the fiscal third and fourth quarters (the “COVID-19 Shutdown Costs”). We resumed operations at reduced production levels at our manufacturing facilities by mid-May 2020 and we are continuing to ramp up production. Our facilities resumed operations with new temperature screening, social distancing, personal protective equipment, and cleaning protocols to protect our employees and mitigate risk of further business interruption. The COVID-19 Pandemic has impacted our supply chain, particularly as a result of mandatory shutdowns in locations where products are manufactured. It is also possible that we could experience future disruptions to our supply chain that are significant as well as significant deterioration in macroeconomic factors that typically affect us, such as consumer spending and demand for our products. In addition, we have experienced and are likely to continue to experience disruptions in manufacturing and logistics due to the COVID-19 12 Pandemic, and we may experience disruptions in manufacturing or logistics in the future due to inconsistent and unanticipated order patterns, our inability to develop long-term relationships with key suppliers, other diseases or pandemics or un foreseen natural disasters or public health emergencies. Further, if there are future closures we may face obstacles and delays in re-opening our manufacturing facilities as we may have to hire and train a substantial number of new employees as some of the employees that we have temporarily laid off may seek or have found other employment. The disruptions caused by the COVID-19 Pandemic, including the temporary manufacturing suspension and supplier and workforce constraints, resulted in a decline in wholesale unit sales volume of nearly 50% during the February 2020 to June 2020 period as compared to the same prior-year period. In addition, the COVID-19 Pandemic has caused a significant economic slowdown, which could cause a global recession, which we expect would negatively impact the sale of our boats. If general economic conditions deteriorate further we cannot predict the duration or strength of an economic recovery, either in the United States or in the specific markets where we sell our products. Further, consumers often finance purchases of our boats from dealers and accordingly, consumer credit market conditions also influence demand for our boats from dealers. If credit conditions worsen and adversely affect the ability of consumers to finance potential purchases at acceptable terms and interest rates, it could result in a decrease in the sales of our products. On March 19, 2020, we drew $35.0 million on our revolving credit agreement as a precautionary measure in order to increase our cash position and preserve financial flexibility in light of uncertainty in the global markets resulting from the COVID-19 Pandemic. Additionally, on May 7, 2020, we entered into Amendment No. 3 (the “Amendment”) to the Fourth Amended & Restated Credit and Guarantee Agreement (the “Credit Facility”) to strengthen our financial flexibility. Among other things, the changes effected by the Amendment provide temporary relief under our financial covenants. See Note 8 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding these changes. While the performance of the business and our cash management activities provided the flexibility to repay $25.0 million of the Credit Facility as of June 30, 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic, we may be required to raise additional capital and any such additional debt financing that may be needed, beyond the $25.0 million of borrowing availability on the Credit Facility, may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. The severity of the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on our business will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the duration, spread, severity and impact of the pandemic, the remedial actions and stimulus measures adopted by local and federal governments, the effects of the pandemic on our consumers and suppliers, and to the extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. The inherent uncertainty surrounding COVID-19, due in part to rapidly changing governmental directives, public health challenges and progress, and market reactions thereto, also makes it more challenging for our management to estimate the potential impact and the future performance of our business. Accordingly, the anticipated negative financial impact to our operating results cannot be reasonably estimated at this time, but could be material and last for an extended period of time. General economic conditions, particularly in the U.S., affect our industry, demand for our products and our business, and results of operations. Demand for premium sport boats, outboard boats, and sterndrive boats can be, and in the past has been, significantly influenced by weak economic conditions, low consumer confidence, high unemployment, and increased market volatility worldwide, especially in the U.S. In times of economic uncertainty and contraction, consumers tend to have less discretionary income and tend to defer or avoid expenditures for discretionary items, such as our products. Sales of our products are highly sensitive to personal discretionary spending levels. Our business is cyclical in nature and its success is impacted by economic conditions, the overall level of consumer confidence and discretionary income levels. Any substantial deterioration in general economic conditions (including as a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic) that diminishes consumer confidence or discretionary income may reduce our sales and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Corporate restructurings, layoffs, declines in the value of investments and residential real estate, higher fuel and energy prices, higher interest rates, and increases in federal and state taxation may also each materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Consumers often finance purchases of our products, and as a result, consumer credit market conditions influence demand for our boats. If credit conditions worsen (including as a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic), and adversely affect the ability of consumers to finance potential purchases at acceptable terms and interest rates, it could result in a decrease in the sales of our products. 13 Our annual and quarterly financial results are subject to sig nificant fluctuations depending on various factors, many of which are beyond our control. Our sales and operating results can vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year depending on various factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to: • seasonal consumer demand for our products; • discretionary spending habits; • changes in pricing in, or the availability of supply in, the used powerboat market; • failure to maintain a premium brand image; • disruption in the operation of our manufacturing facilities, including those as a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic; • variations in the timing and volume of our sales; • the timing of our expenditures in anticipation of future sales; • sales promotions by us and our competitors; • changes in competitive and economic conditions generally; • consumer preferences and competition for consumers’ leisure time, including those as a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic; • impact of unfavorable weather conditions; • changes in trade policy or the imposition of additional tariffs; • civil insurrection or social unrest (such as the recent protests and social movements across several North American cities); • changes in the cost or availability of our labor; and • increased fuel prices. Due to these and other factors, our results of operations may decline quickly and significantly in response to changes in order patterns or rapid decreases in demand for our products. We anticipate that fluctuations in operating results will continue in the future. Unfavorable weather conditions may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, especially during the peak boating season. Adverse weather conditions in any year in any particular geographic region may adversely affect sales in that region, especially during the peak boating season. Sales of our products are generally stronger just before and during spring and summer, which represent the peak boating months in most of our markets, and favorable weather during these months generally has a positive effect on consumer demand. Conversely, unseasonably cool weather, excessive rainfall, reduced rainfall levels, or drought conditions during these periods may close area boating locations or render boating dangerous or inconvenient, thereby generally reducing consumer demand for our products. Our annual results would be materially and adversely affected if our net sales were to fall below expected seasonal levels during these periods. We may also experience more pronounced seasonal fluctuation in net sales in the future as we continue to expand our businesses. Additionally, to the extent that unfavorable weather conditions are exacerbated by global climate change or otherwise, our sales may be affected to a greater degree than we have previously experienced. There can be no assurance that weather conditions will not have a material effect on the sales of any of our products. Our results after acquisitions may suffer if we do not effectively manage our expanded operations following our recent acquisitions. The size of our business has increased significantly as a result of our acquisitions. Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to manage this expanded business, which will pose substantial challenges for management, including challenges related to the management and monitoring of additional operations and associated increased costs and complexity. There can be no assurances we will be successful or that we will realize the expected benefits currently anticipated from these or any other acquisitions. The acquisitions may underperform relative to our expectations. We may not be able to maintain the levels of revenue, earnings or operating efficiency as a combined business that MasterCraft, NauticStar, and Crest have previously achieved or might achieve separately. The business and financial performance of the acquisitions are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including the risk of the loss of, or changes to, its relationships with its dealers and suppliers, increased product liability and warranty claims, and negative publicity or other events that could diminish the value of the NauticStar or Crest brand, which in turn could also adversely affect the MasterCraft brand. If we are unable to achieve the same growth, 14 revenues and profitability that our acquisitions have achieved in the past, our business, financial condition , results of operations , or cash flows could be adversely affected. In relation to such acquisitions, we recognized significantly higher amounts of intangible assets, including goodwill. These intangible assets are subject to impairment testing and an impairment of our intangible assets was triggered as of March 29, 2020, due to the economic outlook at that time, the significant declines in our share price, market volatility and the disruption in our operations, as a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic. As a result of the analysis, we recorded impairment charges totaling $56.4 million related to the NauticStar and Crest segments (the “Impairment Charges”). The Impairment Charges were principally a result of a decline, in the fiscal third quarter, in market conditions, including our share price, and the outlook for retail and wholesale sales and operating performance, as of March 29, 2020, relative to our acquisition plans and annual impairment test performed as of June 30, 2019. See Note 6 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding the Impairment Charges. This impairment charge, along with the impairment charge recognized in fiscal 2019 related to NauticStar, resulted in the elimination of all goodwill associated with the NauticStar and Crest acquisitions. However as of June 30, 2020, there was $47.5 million of intangible assets other than goodwill remaining on our consolidated balance sheet. We could continue to incur a significant impact to our financial statements in the form of impairment charges related to these remaining intangible assets if assumptions and expectations related to our acquisitions are not realized. We depend on our network of independent dealers and face increasing competition for dealers. Substantially all of our sales are derived from our network of independent dealers. Our agreements with dealers in our networks typically provide for one-year terms, although some agreements have longer terms. The loss of one or more of these dealers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The number of dealers supporting our products and the quality of their marketing and servicing efforts are essential to our ability to generate sales. Competition for dealers among performance sport boat manufacturers continues to increase based on the quality, price, value, and availability of the manufacturers’ products, the manufacturers’ attention to customer service, and the marketing support that the manufacturer provides to the dealers. We face intense competition from other premium performance sport, outboard, and sterndrive boat manufacturers in attracting and retaining dealers (some of whom also sell products from other premium performance sport, outboard, and sterndrive boat manufacturers), affecting our ability to attract or retain relationships with qualified and successful dealers. Although our management believes that the quality of our products in the premium performance sport, outboard boat, sterndrive boat industries should permit us to maintain our relationships with our dealers and our market share position, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or improve our relationships with our dealers or our market share position. In addition, independent dealers in the powerboat industry have experienced significant consolidation in recent years, which could result in the loss of one or more of our dealers in the future if the surviving entity in any such consolidation purchases similar products from a competitor. A substantial deterioration in the number of dealers or quality of our network of dealers would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Our success depends, in part, on the financial health of our dealers and their continued access to financing. Because we sell nearly all of our products through dealers, their financial health is critical to our success. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected if the financial health of the dealers that sell our products suffers. Their financial health may suffer for a variety of reasons, including a downturn in general economic conditions, rising interest rates, higher rents, increased labor costs and taxes, compliance with regulations, and personal financial issues (all of which may be negatively impacted by the COVID-19 Pandemic). In addition, our dealers require adequate liquidity to finance their operations, including purchases of our products. Dealers are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could unfavorably affect their liquidity positions, including, among other things, continued access to adequate financing sources on a timely basis on reasonable terms. These sources of financing are vital to our ability to sell products through our distribution network. Access to floor plan financing generally facilitates our dealers’ ability to purchase boats from us, and their financed purchases reduce our working capital requirements. If floor plan financing were not available to our dealers or if the cost of the financing increases, our sales and our working capital levels would be adversely affected. The availability and terms of financing offered by our dealers’ floor plan financing providers will continue to be influenced by: • their ability to access certain capital markets and to fund their operations in a cost-effective manner; • changes in interest rates; • the performance of their overall credit portfolios; • their willingness to accept the risks associated with lending to dealers; and • the overall creditworthiness of those dealers. 15 We may be required to repurchase inventory of certain dealers. Many of our dealers have floor plan financing arrangements with third-party finance companies that enable the dealers to purchase our products. In connection with these agreements, we may have an obligation to repurchase our products from a finance company under certain circumstances, and we may not have any control over the timing or amount of any repurchase obligation nor have access to capital on terms acceptable to us to satisfy any repurchase obligation. This obligation is triggered if a dealer defaults on its debt obligations to a finance company, the finance company repossesses the boat and the boat is returned to us. Our obligation to repurchase a repossessed boat for the unpaid balance of our original invoice price for the boat is subject to reduction or limitation based on the age and condition of the boat at the time of repurchase, and in certain cases, by an aggregate cap on repurchase obligations associated with a particular floor plan financing program. In addition, applicable laws regulating dealer relations may also require us to repurchase our products from our dealers under certain circumstances, and we may not have any control over the timing or amount of any repurchase obligation nor have access to capital on terms acceptable to us to satisfy any repurchase obligation. If we were obligated to repurchase a significant number of units under any repurchase agreement or under applicable dealer laws, our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected. If we fail to manage our manufacturing levels while still addressing the seasonal retail pattern for our products, our business and margins may suffer. The seasonality of retail demand for our products, together with our goal of balancing production throughout the year, requires us to manage our manufacturing and allocate our products to our dealer network to address anticipated retail demand. Our dealers must manage seasonal changes in consumer demand and inventory. If our dealers reduce their inventories in response to weakness in retail demand, we could be required to reduce our production, resulting in lower rates of absorption of fixed costs in our manufacturing and, therefore, lower margins. As a result, we must balance the economies of level production with the seasonal retail sales pattern experienced by our dealers. In addition, as we navigate the unprecedented confluence of demand and disruption precipitated by the COVID-19 Pandemic, our production during this ramp up period will depend, in large part, on our suppliers’ capacity and our ability to grow and maintain a high-performing workforce. Failure to adjust manufacturing levels adequately may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Our sales and profitability depend, in part, on the successful introduction of new products. Market acceptance of our products depends on our technological innovation and our ability to implement technology in our boats. Our sales and profitability may be adversely affected by difficulties or delays in product development, such as an inability to develop viable or innovative new products. In February 2019 we introduced a new brand, Aviara, with sales beginning in the first quarter of 2020. Our failure to introduce new technologies and product offerings that consumers desire, including our new Aviara models, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Also, our ability to achieve higher margins, in part, relies on the introduction of new features or enhancements to our existing boat models. If we fail to introduce new features or those we introduce fail to gain market acceptance, our margins may suffer. In addition, some of our direct competitors and indirect competitors may have significantly more resources to develop and patent new technologies. It is possible that our competitors will develop and patent equivalent or superior technologies and other products that compete with ours. They may assert these patents against us and we may be required to license these patents on unfavorable terms or cease using the technology covered by these patents, either of which would harm our competitive position and may materially adversely affect our business. We also cannot be certain that our products or features have not infringed or will not infringe the proprietary rights of others. Any such infringement could cause third parties, including our competitors, to bring claims against us, resulting in significant costs and potential damages. We have a fixed cost base that will affect our profitability if our sales decrease. The fixed cost levels of operating a powerboat manufacturer can put pressure on profit margins when sales and production decline. Our profitability depends, in part, on our ability to spread fixed costs over a sufficiently large number of products sold and shipped, and if we make a decision to reduce our rate of production, gross or net margins could be negatively affected. Consequently, decreased demand or the need to reduce production can lower our ability to absorb fixed costs and materially impact our financial condition or results of operations. Our industry is characterized by intense competition, which affects our sales and profits. The premium performance sport boat, outboard, and sterndrive boat categories and the powerboat industry as a whole are highly competitive for consumers and dealers. We also compete against consumer demand for used boats. Competition affects our ability to 16 succeed in both the markets we currently serve and new markets that we may enter in the future. Competition is based primarily on brand name, price, product selection, and product performance. We compete with several large ma nufacturers that may have greater financial, marketing, and other resources than we do and who are represented by dealers in the markets in which we now operate and into which we plan to expand. We also compete with a variety of small, independent manufact urers. We cannot provide assurance that we will not face greater competition from existing large or small manufacturers or that we will be able to compete successfully with new competitors. Our failure to compete effectively with our current and future com petitors would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our sales may be adversely impacted by increased consumer preference for used boats or the supply of new boats by competitors in excess of demand. During the economic downturn that commenced in 2008, we observed a shift in consumer demand toward purchasing more used boats, primarily because prices for used boats are typically lower than retail prices for new boats. If this were to occur again (including as a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic), it could have the effect of reducing demand among retail purchasers for our new boats. Also, while we have taken steps designed to balance production volumes for our boats with demand, our competitors could choose to reduce the price of their products, which could have the effect of reducing demand for our new boats. Reduced demand for new boats could lead to reduced sales by us, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Our international markets require significant management attention, expose us to difficulties presented by international economic, political, legal, and business factors, and may not be successful or produce desired levels of sales and profitability. We currently sell our products throughout the world. International markets have been, and will continue to be, a focus for sales growth. We believe many opportunities exist in the international markets, and over time we intend for international sales to comprise a larger percentage of our total revenue. Several factors, including weakened international economic conditions, could adversely affect such growth and there can be no assurance that we will be able to sustain our current international sales levels in the future. The expansion of our existing international operations and entry into additional international markets require significant management attention. Some of the countries in which we market, and in which our distributors or licensee(s) sell our products, are subject to political, economic, or social instability. Our international operations expose us and our representatives, agents, and distributors to risks inherent in operating in foreign jurisdictions. These risks include, but are not limited to: • increased costs of customizing products for foreign countries; • unfamiliarity with local demographics, consumer preferences, and discretionary spending patterns; • difficulties in attracting consumers due to a reduced level of consumer familiarity with our brand; • competition with new, unfamiliar competitors; • the imposition of additional foreign governmental controls or regulations, including rules relating to environmental, health, and safety matters and regulations, and other laws applicable to publicly-traded companies, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA; • new or enhanced trade restrictions and restrictions on the activities of foreign agents, representatives, and distributors; • the imposition of increases in costly and lengthy import and export licensing and other compliance requirements, customs duties and tariffs, license obligations, and other non-tariff barriers to trade; • changes to the U.S.’s participation in, withdrawal out of, renegotiation of certain international trade agreements or other major trade related issues including the non-renewal of expiring favorable tariffs granted to developing countries, tariff quotas, and retaliatory tariffs, trade sanctions, new or onerous trade restrictions, embargoes and other stringent government controls; • the relative strength of the U.S. dollar compared to local currency, making our products less price-competitive relative to products manufactured outside of the U.S.; • laws and business practices favoring local companies; • longer payment cycles and difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems; • difficulties in enforcing or defending intellectual property rights; and • insurrection or war that may disrupt or limit our relationships with our foreign consumers. 17 Our international operations may not produce desired levels of total sales, or one or more of the foregoing factors may harm our business, financial condition, or results of operations. International tariffs could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. The current political landscape has introduced significant uncertainty with respect to future trade regulations and existing international trade agreements, as shown by the recent U.S.-initiated renegotiation of the North America Free Trade Agreement, and Brexit in Europe. This uncertainty includes the possibility of imposing additional tariffs or penalties on products manufactured outside the U.S and the potential for increased trade barriers between the UK and the European Union. The institution of global trade tariffs carries the risk of negatively affecting global economic conditions, which could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations. In addition, U.S. initiated tariffs on certain foreign goods, including raw materials, commodities, and products manufactured outside the United States that are used in our manufacturing processes may cause our manufacturing cost to rise, which would have a negative impact on our business and results of operations. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could result in declines in our reported sales and net earnings. The changing relationships of primarily the U.S. dollar to the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar, the Euro, the British pound sterling, the Japanese yen, and certain other foreign currencies have from time to time had a negative impact on our results of operations. Fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to these foreign currencies can adversely affect the price of our products in foreign markets and the costs we incur to import certain components for our products. We will often attempt to offset these higher prices with increased discounts, which can lead to reduced net sales per unit. Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly. Borrowings under our revolving credit facility and term loans are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. Reference rates used to determine the applicable interest rates for our debt are currently at relatively low levels. If interest rates increase, the debt service obligations on our indebtedness will increase even if the amount borrowed remains the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease. Please see Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” for discussion of our market risk related to interest rates. The Chief Executive of the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”), which regulates LIBOR, has announced that the FCA will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after calendar year 2021. That announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after calendar year 2021. Moreover, it is possible that LIBOR will be discontinued or modified prior to the end of calendar year 2021. All of our $108.6 million of debt outstanding under our credit agreement as of June 30, 2020 bears interest at a floating rate that uses either LIBOR or the prime rate as the reference rate to calculate our interest rate. Our credit agreement provides that, if the administrative agent has determined that adequate means do not exist for ascertaining LIBOR or that LIBOR does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to lenders for making, funding or maintaining their loans, then all of our outstanding loans under the credit agreement will be converted into loans that accrue interest at the prime rate. Further, the lenders under our credit agreement will no longer be obligated to make loans using LIBOR as the reference rate. Uncertainty as to the nature of potential changes to LIBOR, fallback provisions, alternative reference rates or other reforms could adversely impact our interest expense on our floating rate debt that currently uses LIBOR as the applicable reference rate. Further, the discontinuance or modification of LIBOR and the use of the prime rate may result in an increase in the cost of future indebtedness, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flow and results of operations. We intend to closely monitor the financial markets and the use of fallback provisions and alternative reference rates in anticipation of the discontinuance or modification of LIBOR by the end of calendar year 2021. We compete with a variety of other activities for consumers’ scarce leisure time. Our boats are used for recreational and sport purposes, and demand for our boats may be adversely affected by competition from other activities that occupy consumers’ leisure time and by changes in consumer lifestyle, usage pattern, or taste. Similarly, an overall decrease in consumer leisure time may reduce consumers’ willingness to purchase and enjoy our products. 18 Our success depends on the continued strength of our brands and the value of our brands, and sales of our products could be diminished if we, the athletes who use our products, or the sports and activities in which our products are used are associated with negative publicity. We believe that our brands are a significant contributor to the success of our business and that maintaining and enhancing our brands is important to expanding our consumer and dealer base. Failure to continue to protect our brands may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Negative publicity, including that resulting from severe injuries or death occurring in the sports and activities in which our products are used, could negatively affect our reputation and result in restrictions, recalls, or bans on the use of our products. Further, actions taken by athletes associated with our products that harm the reputations of those athletes could also harm our brand image and adversely affect our financial condition. If the popularity of the sports and activities for which we design, manufacture, and sell products were to decrease as a result of these risks or any negative publicity, sales of our products could decrease, which could have an adverse effect on our net sales, profitability, and operating results. In addition, if we become exposed to additional claims and litigation relating to the use of our products, our reputation may be adversely affected by such claims, whether or not successful, including by generating potential negative publicity about our products, which could adversely impact our business and financial condition. We may not be able to execute our manufacturing strategy successfully, which could cause the profitability of our products to suffer. Our manufacturing strategy is designed to improve product quality and increase productivity, while reducing costs and increasing flexibility to respond to ongoing changes in the marketplace. To implement this strategy, we must be successful in our continuous improvement efforts, which depend on the involvement of management, production employees, and suppliers. Any inability to achieve these objectives could adversely impact the profitability of our products and our ability to deliver desirable products to our consumers. Our ability to meet our manufacturing workforce needs is crucial to our results of operations and future sales and profitability. We rely on the existence of an available hourly workforce to manufacture our boats. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to attract and retain qualified employees to meet current or future manufacturing needs at a reasonable cost, or at all. Although none of our employees are currently covered by collective bargaining agreements, we cannot provide assurance that our employees will not elect to be represented by labor unions in the future, which could increase our labor costs. Additionally, competition for qualified employees could require us to pay higher wages to attract a sufficient number of employees. Significant increases in manufacturing workforce costs could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. We rely on third-party suppliers and, in particular, suppliers of the engine packages used in the manufacturing of our boats. We depend on third-party suppliers to provide components and raw materials essential to the construction of our boats. While we believe that our relationships with our current suppliers are sufficient to provide the materials necessary to meet present production demand, we cannot provide assurance that these relationships will continue or that the quantity or quality of materials available from these suppliers will be sufficient to meet our future needs, irrespective of whether we successfully implement our growth strategy. Our suppliers’ ability to provide the components and raw materials essential to the construction of our boats may also be adversely impacted as a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic. As production increases, our need for raw materials and supplies will increase. Our suppliers must be prepared to ramp up operations and, in many cases, hire additional workers and/or expand capacity in order to fulfill the orders placed by us and other consumers. Operational and financial difficulties that our suppliers may face in the future could adversely affect their ability to supply us with the parts and components we need, which could significantly disrupt our operations. The availability and cost of engines used in the manufacture of our boats are especially critical. For fiscal 2020, we purchased all of the inboard engine packages for our MasterCraft brand boats from Ilmor. We also maintain a strong and long-standing relationship with our primary supplier of NauticStar engine packages, Yamaha, and our primary supplier of Crest engine packages, Mercury. While we believe that our relationships with these suppliers are sufficient to provide the materials necessary to meet present production demand, there can be no assurance that these relationships will continue or that the quantity or quality of the engines provided will be sufficient to meet our future needs, irrespective of whether we successfully implement our growth strategy. If we are required to replace these suppliers, it could cause a decrease in products available for sale or an increase in the cost of goods sold, either of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition to the risk of interruption of our engine supply, these suppliers could potentially exert significant bargaining power over price, quality, warranty claims, or other terms relating to the engines we use. We are required to purchase a minimum volume of engines from Ilmor annually. In addition, MasterCraft could be required to pay a penalty to Ilmor in order to maintain exclusivity if annual purchases under the agreement fail to meet a certain threshold. While these minimums are significantly below our current volumes, there can be no assurance that we will continue to meet these minimums in the future. 19 Termination or interruption of informal supply arrangements could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. We have informal supply arrangements with some of our suppliers, including the sole supplier of our gas and ballast tanks. In the event of a termination of a supply arrangement, there can be no assurance that alternate supply arrangements will be made on satisfactory terms. If we need to enter into supply arrangements on unsatisfactory terms, or if there are any delays to our supply arrangements, it could adversely affect our business and operating results. We depend on key personnel and we may not be able to retain them or attract, assimilate, and retain highly qualified employees in the future. Our future success will depend in significant part on the continued service of our senior management team and our continuing ability to attract, assimilate, and retain highly qualified and skilled managerial, product development, manufacturing, marketing, and other personnel. The loss of the services of any members of our senior management or other key personnel or the inability to hire or retain qualified personnel in the future could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We may attempt to grow our business through additional acquisitions or strategic alliances and new partnerships, which we may not be successful in completing or integrating . We may in the future explore acquisitions and strategic alliances that will enable us to acquire complementary skills and capabilities, offer new products, expand our consumer base, enter new product categories or geographic markets, and obtain other competitive advantages. We cannot provide assurance, however, that we will identify acquisition candidates or strategic partners that are suitable to our business, obtain financing on satisfactory terms, complete acquisitions or strategic alliances, or successfully integrate acquired operations into our existing operations. Once integrated, acquired operations may not achieve anticipated levels of sales or profitability, or otherwise perform as expected. Acquisitions also involve special risks, including risks associated with unanticipated challenges, liabilities and contingencies, and diversion of management attention and resources from our existing operations. Similarly, our partnership with leading franchises from other industries to market our products or with third-party technology providers to introduce new technology to the market may not achieve anticipated levels of consumer enthusiasm and acceptance, or achieve anticipated levels of sales or profitability, or otherwise perform as expected. Our intellectual property rights may be inadequate to protect our business. We attempt to protect our intellectual property through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, protected design, and trade secret laws. We hold patents, trademarks, copyrights, and design rights relating to various aspects of our products and believe that proprietary technical know-how is important to our business. Proprietary rights relating to our products are protected from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that they are covered by valid and enforceable patents, trademarks, or copyrights, to the extent they are protected designs, or to the extent they are maintained in confidence as trade secrets. We cannot be certain that we will be issued any patents from any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us, or that the claims allowed under any issued patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. Further, the patents we own could be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented by others. Further, we cannot provide assurance that competitors will not infringe our patents, or that we will have adequate resources to enforce our patents. We also rely on unpatented proprietary technology. It is possible that others will independently develop the same or similar technology or otherwise obtain access to our unpatented technology. To protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information, we require employees, consultants, advisors, and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements. We cannot provide assurance that these agreements will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets, know-how, or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use, misappropriation, or disclosure of such trade secrets, know-how, or other proprietary information. If we are unable to maintain the proprietary nature of our technologies, we could be materially adversely affected. Further, we have attempted to protect certain of our vessel hull designs by seeking to register those designs with the U.S. Copyright Office. We cannot provide assurance that our applications will be approved. If approved, protection of the vessel design lasts ten years. However, our protected vessel hull designs could be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented by others. Further, we cannot provide assurance that competitors will not infringe our designs, or that we will have adequate resources to enforce our rights. We rely on our trademarks, trade names, and brand names to distinguish our products from the products of our competitors and have registered or applied to register many of these trademarks. We cannot provide assurance that our trademark applications will be approved. Third parties may also oppose our trademark applications, or otherwise challenge our use of the trademarks. In the event that our trademarks are successfully challenged, we could be forced to rebrand our products, which could result in loss of brand recognition, 20 and could require us to devote resources to advertising and marketing new br ands. Further, we cannot provide assurance that competitors will not infringe our trademarks, or that we will have adequate resources to enforce our trademarks. If third parties claim that we infringe on their intellectual property rights, our financial condition could be adversely affected. We face the risk of claims that we have infringed third parties’ intellectual property rights. Any claims of patent or other intellectual property infringement, even those without merit, could be expensive and time consuming to defend, cause us to cease making, licensing, or using products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property, require us to redesign, reengineer, or rebrand our products, if feasible, divert management’s attention and resources, or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use a third party’s intellectual property. Any royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. A successful claim of infringement against us could result in our being required to pay significant damages, enter into costly license or royalty agreements, or stop the sale of certain products, any of which could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. While we are not currently involved in any outstanding intellectual property litigation that we believe, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations, we cannot predict the outcome of any pending litigation and an unfavorable outcome could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Product liability, warranty, personal injury, property damage, and recall claims may materially affect our financial condition and damage our reputation. We are engaged in a business that exposes us to claims for product liability and warranty claims in the event our products actually or allegedly fail to perform as expected, or the use of our products results, or is alleged to result, in property damage, personal injury, or death. We have in the past incurred such liabilities and may in the future be exposed to liability for such claims. Although we maintain product and general liability insurance of the types and in the amounts that we believe are customary for the industry, we are not fully insured against all such potential claims. We may experience legal claims in excess of our insurance coverage or claims that are not covered by insurance, either of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Adverse determination of material product liability and warranty claims made against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and harm our reputation. In addition, if any of our products are, or are alleged to be, defective, we may be required to participate in a recall of that product if the defect or alleged defect relates to safety. These and other claims we may face could be costly to us and require substantial management attention. Significant product repair and/or replacement due to product warranty claims or product recalls could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. We provide a limited warranty for our products. We may provide additional warranties related to certain promotional programs, as well as warranties in certain geographical markets as determined by local regulations and market conditions. Although we employ quality control procedures, sometimes a product is distributed that needs repair or replacement. Our standard warranties require us or our dealers to repair or replace defective products during such warranty periods at no cost to the consumer. Historically, product recalls have been administered through our dealers and distributors. The repair and replacement costs we could incur in connection with a recall could adversely affect our business. In addition, product recalls could harm our reputation and cause us to lose consumers, particularly if recalls cause consumers to question the safety or reliability of our products. The nature of our business exposes us to workers’ compensation claims and other workplace liabilities. Certain materials we use require our employees to handle potentially hazardous or toxic substances. While our employees who handle these and other potentially hazardous or toxic materials receive specialized training and wear protective clothing, there is still a risk that they, or others, may be exposed to these substances. Exposure to these substances could result in significant injury to our employees and damage to our property or the property of others, including natural resource damage. Our personnel are also at risk for other workplace- related injuries, including slips and falls. We have in the past been, and may in the future be, subject to fines, penalties, and other liabilities in connection with any such injury or damage. Although we currently maintain what we believe to be suitable and adequate insurance in excess of our self-insured amounts, we may be unable to maintain such insurance on acceptable terms or such insurance may not provide adequate protection against potential liabilities. We may be subject to information technology system failures, network disruptions, and breaches in data security. We use many information technology systems and their underlying infrastructure to operate our business. In addition to the disruptions that may occur from interruptions in our information technology systems, cybersecurity threats and sophisticated and targeted cyberattacks pose a risk to our information technology systems. We have established security policies, processes, and defenses designed to help identify and protect against intentional and unintentional misappropriation or corruption of our information technology systems 21 and information and disruption of our operations. Despite these efforts, our information technology systems may be damaged, disrupted, or shut down due to attacks by unauthorized acc ess, malicious software, computer viruses, undetected intrusion, hardware failures, or other events, and in these circumstances our disaster recovery plans may be ineffective or inadequate. These breaches or intrusions could lead to business interruption, exposure of proprietary or confidential information, data corruption, damage to our reputation, exposure to legal and regulatory proceedings, and other costs. A security breach might also lead to violations of privacy laws, regulations, trade guidelines or practices related to our customers and associates and could result in potential claims from customers, associates, shareholders, or regulatory agencies. Such events could adversely impact our reputation, business, financial position, results of operations , and cash flows. In addition, we could be adversely affected if any of our significant customers or suppliers experiences any similar events that disrupt their business operations or damage their reputation. While we maintain monitoring practices and protections of our information technology to reduce these risks and test our systems on an ongoing basis for potential threats, there can be no assurance that these efforts will prevent a cyber-attack or other security breach. We carry cybersecurity insurance to help mitigate the financial exposure and related notification procedures in the event of intentional intrusion; however, there can be no assurance that our insurance will adequately protect against potential losses that could adversely affect our business. An increase in energy costs may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Higher energy costs result in increases in operating expenses at our manufacturing facility and in the expense of shipping products to our dealers. In addition, increases in energy costs may adversely affect the pricing and availability of petroleum-based raw materials, such as resins and foams that are used in our products. Also, higher fuel prices may have an adverse effect on demand for our boats, as they increase the cost of ownership and operation. We are subject to U.S. and other anti-corruption laws, trade controls, economic sanctions, and similar laws and regulations, including those in the jurisdictions where we operate. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us to civil, criminal, and administrative penalties and harm our reputation. Doing business on a worldwide basis requires us to comply with the laws and regulations of various foreign jurisdictions. These laws and regulations place restrictions on our operations, trade practices, partners, and investment decisions. In particular, our operations are subject to U.S. and foreign anti-corruption and trade control laws and regulations, such as the FCPA, export controls, and economic sanctions programs, including those administered by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC. As a result of doing business in foreign countries and with foreign partners, we are exposed to a heightened risk of violating anti-corruption and trade control laws and sanctions regulations. The FCPA prohibits us from providing anything of value to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or securing any improper business advantage. It also requires us to keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect our transactions. Economic sanctions programs restrict our business dealings with certain sanctioned countries, persons, and entities. In addition, because we act through dealers and distributors, we face the risk that our dealers, distributors, or consumers might further distribute our products to a sanctioned person or entity, or an ultimate end-user in a sanctioned country, which might subject us to an investigation concerning compliance with OFAC or other sanctions regulations. Violations of anti-corruption and trade control laws and sanctions regulations are punishable by civil penalties, including fines, denial of export privileges, injunctions, asset seizures, debarment from government contracts, and revocations or restrictions of licenses, as well as criminal fines and imprisonment. We cannot provide assurance that all of our local, strategic, or joint partners will comply with these laws and regulations, in which case we could be held liable for actions taken inside or outside of the U.S., even though our partners may not be subject to these laws. Such a violation could materially and adversely affect our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition. Our continued international expansion, including in developing countries, and our development of new partnerships and joint venture relationships worldwide increase the risk of FCPA or OFAC violations in the future. 22 If we are unable to comp ly with environmental and other regulatory requirements, our business may be exposed to material liability and/or fines. Our operations are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations, including those concerning product safety, environmental protection, and occupational health and safety. Some of these laws and regulations require us to obtain permits and limit our ability to discharge hazardous materials into the environment. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we may be subject to civil or criminal enforcement actions that could result in the assessment of fines and penalties, obligations to conduct remedial or corrective actions, or, in extreme circumstances, revocation of our permits or injunctions preventing some or all of our operations. In addition, the components of our boats must meet certain regulatory standards, including stringent air emission standards for boat engines. Failure to meet these standards could result in an inability to sell our boats in key markets, which would adversely affect our business. Moreover, compliance with these regulatory requirements could increase the cost of our products, which in turn, may reduce consumer demand. While we believe that we are in material compliance with applicable federal, state, local, and foreign regulatory requirements, and hold all licenses and permits required thereunder, we cannot provide assurance that we will, at all times, be able to continue to comply with applicable regulatory requirements. Compliance with increasingly stringent regulatory and permit requirements may, in the future, cause us to incur substantial capital costs and increase our cost of operations, or may limit our operations, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition. As with most boat construction businesses, our manufacturing processes involve the use, handling, storage, and contracting for recycling or disposal of hazardous substances and wastes. The failure to manage or dispose of such hazardous substances and wastes properly could expose us to material liability or fines, including liability for personal injury or property damage due to exposure to hazardous substances, damages to natural resources, or for the investigation and remediation of environmental conditions. Under environmental laws, we may be liable for remediation of contamination at sites where our hazardous wastes have been disposed or at our current or former facilities, regardless of whether such facilities are owned or leased or whether the environmental conditions were created by us, a prior owner or tenant, or a third-party. While we do not believe that we are presently subject to any such liabilities, we cannot assure you that environmental conditions relating to our prior, existing, or future sites or operations or those of predecessor companies will not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition. Negative public perception of our products or restrictions on the access or the use of our products in certain locations could materially adversely affect our business or results of operations. Demand for our products depends in part on their acceptance by the public. Public concerns about the environmental impact of our products or their perceived safety could result in diminished public perception of the products we sell. Government, media, or activist pressure to limit emissions could also negatively impact consumers’ perceptions of our products. Any decline in the public acceptance of our products could negatively impact their sales or lead to changes in laws, rules and regulations that prevent access to certain locations or restrict use or manner of use in certain areas or during certain times, which could also negatively impact sales. Any material decline in the public acceptance of our products could impact our ability to retain existing consumers or attract new ones which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Natural disasters, environmental disasters, the effects of climate change, pandemics, or other disruptions, or civil insurrection or social unrest at our manufacturing facilities or in other regions of the United States could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We rely on the continuous operation of our manufacturing facilities in Vonore, Tennessee, Armory, Mississippi, and Owosso, Michigan for the production of our products. Any natural disaster or other serious disruption to our facilities due to fire, snow, flood, earthquake, pandemics, civil insurrection or social unrest or any other unforeseen circumstance could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Changes in climate could adversely affect our operations by limiting or increasing the costs associated with equipment or fuel supplies. In addition, adverse weather conditions, such as increased frequency and/or severity of storms, or floods could impair our ability to operate by damaging our facilities and equipment or restricting product delivery to customers. The occurrence of any disruption at our manufacturing facilities, even for a short period of time, may have an adverse effect on our productivity and profitability, during and after the period of the disruption. These disruptions may also cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment, and environmental damage. Although we maintain property, casualty, and business interruption insurance of the types and in the amounts that we believe are customary for the industry, we are not fully insured against all potential natural disasters or other disruptions to our manufacturing facilities. In addition, we have dealers and third-party suppliers located in regions of the United States that have been and may be exposed to damaging storms, such as hurricanes and tornados, floods and environmental disasters. Although preventative measures may help to 23 mitigate damage, the damage and disruption resulting from natural and environmental disasters may be significant. Such disasters can disrupt our c onsumers, dealers, or suppliers, which can interrupt our operational processes and our sales and profits. Increases in income tax rates or changes in income tax laws or enforcement could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. Changes in domestic and international tax legislation could expose us to additional tax liability. Although we monitor changes in tax laws and work to mitigate the impact of proposed changes, such changes may negatively impact our financial results. In addition, increases in individual income tax rates would negatively affect our potential consumers’ discretionary income and could decrease the demand for our products. Our credit facilities contain covenants which may limit our operating flexibility; failure to comply with covenants may result in our lenders restricting or terminating our ability to borrow under such credit facilities. In the past, we have relied on our existing credit facilities to provide us with adequate liquidity to operate our business. The availability of borrowing amounts under our credit facilities is dependent on compliance with the debt covenants set forth in our credit agreement. Violation of those covenants, whether as a result of operating losses or otherwise, could result in our lenders restricting or terminating our borrowing ability under our credit facilities. If our lenders reduce or terminate our access to amounts under our credit facilities, we may not have sufficient capital to fund our working capital and other needs, and we may need to secure additional capital or financing to fund our operations or to repay outstanding debt under our credit facilities. We cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in ensuring the availability of amounts under our credit facilities or in raising additional capital, or that any amount, if raised, will be sufficient to meet our cash needs or will be on terms as favorable as those which have been available to us historically. If we are not able to maintain our ability to borrow under our credit facilities, or to raise additional capital when needed, our business and operations will be materially adversely affected. Risks Relating to Ownership of our Common Stock Shareholders may be diluted by future issuances of common stock in connection with our incentive plans, acquisitions, or otherwise; future sales of such shares in the public market, or the expectations that such sales may occur, could lower our stock price. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue shares of common stock and options, rights, warrants, and appreciation rights relating to common stock for the consideration and on the terms and conditions established by our board of directors in its sole discretion, whether in connection with acquisitions or otherwise. Any common stock that we issue, including under our 2015 Incentive Award Plan or other equity incentive plans that we may adopt in the future, would dilute the percentage ownership of holders of our common stock. Our common stock price may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance. It is possible that an active trading market for our common stock will not be sustained, which could make it difficult for investors to sell their shares of our common stock at an attractive price or at all. Volatility in the market price of our common stock may prevent investors from being able to sell their shares at or above the price they paid for them. Many factors, which are outside our control, may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly, including those described elsewhere in this “Risk Factors” section and this Form 10-K, as well as the following: • our operating and financial performance and prospects; • our quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in our industry compared to market expectations; • conditions that impact demand for our services; • future announcements concerning our business or our competitors’ businesses; • the public’s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements, and filings with the SEC; • coverage by or changes in financial estimates by securities analysts or failure to meet their expectations; • market and industry perception of our success, or lack thereof, in pursuing our growth strategy; • strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings; • changes in laws or regulations that adversely affect our industry or us; 24 • changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations, or principles; • changes in senior management or key personnel; • issuances, exchanges or sales, or expected issuances, exchanges or sales of our capital stock; • changes in our dividend policy; • adverse resolution of new or pending litigation against us; and • changes in general market, economic, and political conditions in the U.S. and global economies or financial markets, including those resulting from the COVID-19 Pandemic, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, acts of war, civil insurrection and social unrest, and responses to such events. As a result, volatility in the market price of our common stock may prevent investors from being able to sell their common stock at or above the price they paid for it or at all. These broad market and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In addition, price volatility may be greater if the public float and trading volume of our common stock is low. As a result, investors may suffer a loss on their investment. We do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. While we have paid dividends in the past, we presently have no intention to pay dividends on our common stock at any time in the foreseeable future. Any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. Certain of our debt instruments contain covenants that restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us. In addition, we will be permitted under the terms of our debt instruments to incur additional indebtedness, which may restrict or prevent us from paying dividends on our common stock. Furthermore, our ability to declare and pay dividends may be limited by instruments governing future outstanding indebtedness we may incur. Delaware law and certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may prevent efforts by our stockholders to change the direction or management of our Company. We are a Delaware corporation, and the anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated by-laws currently contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult without the approval of our board of directors, including, but not limited to, the following: • our board of directors will be classified into three classes until our 2022 annual meeting of stockholders; • only our board of directors may call special meetings of our stockholders; and • we require advance notice and duration of ownership requirements for stockholder proposals. These provisions could discourage, delay, or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and cause us to take other corporate actions they desire. In addition, because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions could in turn affect any attempt by our stockholders to replace current members of our management team. For as long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to comply with certain reporting requirements, including those relating to accounting standards and disclosure about our executive compensation, that apply to other public companies. We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies,” including, but not limited to, (i) not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (ii) reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and (iii) exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and of stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We have elected to adopt these reduced disclosure requirements. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive as a result of our taking advantage of these exemptions and as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. We will remain an “emerging growth company” until June 30, 2021, which is the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of completion of our initial public offering. 25 The obligations associated with being a public company require significant resources and management attention, which may divert us from our business operations. As a result of our initial public offering, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly, and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we establish and maintain effective internal controls and procedures for financial reporting. As a result, we have and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses that we did not previously incur. In addition, the need to establish the corporate infrastructure demanded of a public company may divert management’s attention from implementing our business strategy, which could prevent us from improving our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We have made, and will continue to make, changes to our internal controls, including information technology controls, and procedures for financial reporting and accounting systems to meet our reporting obligations as a public company. However, the measures we take may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations as a public company. If we do not continue to develop and implement the right processes and tools to manage our changing enterprise and maintain our culture, our ability to compete successfully and achieve our business objectives could be impaired, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, we cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur to comply with these requirements. We anticipate that these costs will be material to our general and administrative expenses. Furthermore, as a public company, we have and will continue to incur additional legal, accounting, and other expenses that have not been reflected in our historical financial statements. In addition, rules implemented by the SEC and NASDAQ have imposed various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. These rules and regulations result in our incurring legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly. For example, we expect these rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to maintain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to maintain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified people to serve on our board of directors, on our board committees, or as executive officers. Our failure to achieve and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act as a public company could have a material adverse effect on our business and share price. Prior to the completion of our initial public offering, we had not operated as a public company and were not required to independently comply with Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, starting with the second annual report that we file with the SEC. We were required to meet these standards in the course of preparing our financial statements as of and for the year ended June 30, 2016, and our management is required to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for such year and annually thereafter. Additionally, once we are no longer an “emerging growth company,” our independent registered public accounting firm will be required pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis. The rules governing the standards that must be met for our management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing, and possible remediation. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. We are currently in the process of reviewing, documenting, and testing our internal control over financial reporting. We may encounter problems or delays in implementing any changes necessary to make a favorable assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, we may encounter problems or delays in completing the implementation of any requested improvements and receiving a favorable attestation in connection with the attestation to be provided by our independent registered public accounting firm after we cease to be an emerging growth company. If we cannot favorably assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide an unqualified attestation report on our internal controls after we cease to be an emerging growth company, investors could lose confidence in our financial information and the price of our common stock could decline. Additionally, the existence of any material weakness or significant deficiency may require management to devote significant time and incur significant expense to remediate any such material weaknesses or significant deficiencies and management may not be able to remediate any such material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in a timely manner. The existence of any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could also result in errors in our financial statements that could require us to make out of period adjustments, restate our financial statements, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, and cause stockholders to lose confidence in our reported financial information, all of which could materially and adversely affect our business and share price. 26 If se curities analysts do not publish research or reports about our company, or if they issue unfavorable commentary about us or our industry or downgrade our common stock, the price of our common stock could decline. The trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that third-party securities analysts publish about our company and our industry. We may be unable or slow to attract research coverage and if one or more analysts cease coverage of our company, we could lose visibility in the market. In addition, one or more of these analysts could downgrade our common stock or issue other negative commentary about our company or our industry. As a result of one or more of these factors, the trading price of our common stock could decline. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS. None. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES. As of June 30, 2020, all our MasterCraft and Aviara boats are manufactured and lake-tested at our 250,000-square-foot manufacturing facility located on approximately 60 acres of lakefront land in Vonore, Tennessee. In addition, we own a 35,000 square-foot facility in Vonore where we manufacture trailers, and we lease a 3,000 square-foot warehouse facility in West Yorkshire, England for warehousing of parts. All our NauticStar boats are manufactured in our 200,000-square-foot manufacturing facility located on 17 acres of land in Amory, Mississippi. All our Crest boats are manufactured in a more than 140,000-square-foot manufacturing facility located on approximately 63 acres in Owosso, Michigan. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. None. ITEM 4.

Market Information Our common stock has been publicly traded on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol “MCFT” since July 17, 2015. Prior to that time, there was no public market for our common stock. On September 10, 2020, the last reported sale price on the NASDAQ Global Market of our common stock was $17.91 per share. As of September 4, 2020, we had approximately 6,700 holders of record of our common stock. Capital Allocation Policy We presently intend to retain our earnings, if any, to finance the development and growth of our business and operations and do not anticipate declaring or paying cash dividends on our common stock, or repurchasing stock, in the foreseeable future. Any future determination as to the declaration and payment of dividends, or the repurchase of stock, if any, will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on then-existing conditions, including our operating results, financial condition, contractual restrictions, capital requirements, business prospects, and other factors our board of directors may deem relevant. See Item 1A “Risk Factors” — Risks Relating to Ownership of Our Common Stock. Stock Performance Graph This performance graph shall not be deemed “soliciting material” or to be “filed” with the SEC for purposes of Section 18 of the Exchange Act of 1934, or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that section, and shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any filing of ours under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act. The following stock performance graph illustrates the cumulative total shareholder return on our common stock for the period from July 17, 2015 (the first day of trading for our common stock) to June 30, 2020, as compared to the Russell 2000 Index and the Dow Jones US Recreational Products Index. 28 The comparison assumes (i) a hypothetical investment of $100 in our common stock and the two above mentioned indices on July 17, 2015 and (ii) the full reinvestme nt of all dividends. The comparisons in the graph are not intended to be indicative of possible future performance of our common stock.

For definitions of our non-GAAP measures and a reconciliation of each to net income, see Item 7 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 30 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. The following discussion and analysis should be read together with the sections entitled “Risk Factors,” “Selected Financial Data,” and the financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. In addition, the statements in this discussion and analysis regarding industry outlook, our expectations regarding the performance of our business, anticipated financial results, liquidity and the other non-historical statements are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described in “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and in “Risk Factors” above. Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements. This section generally discusses 2020 and 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019. Discussions of 2018 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018 are not included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and can be found in Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2019, which was filed with the SEC on September 13, 2019. Key Performance Measures From time to time we use certain key performance measures in evaluating our business and results of operations and we may refer to one or more of these key performance measures in this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” These key performance measures include: • Unit sales volume — We define unit sales volume as the number of our boats sold to our dealers during a period. • Net sales per unit — We define net sales per unit as net sales divided by unit sales volume. • Gross margin — We define gross margin as gross profit divided by net sales, expressed as a percentage. • Adjusted EBITDA — We define Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization (“EBITDA”), as further adjusted to eliminate certain non-cash charges and unusual items that we do not consider to be indicative of our core/ongoing operations. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, see “Non-GAAP Measures” below. • Adjusted EBITDA margin — We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by net sales, expressed as a percentage. • Adjusted Net Income — We define Adjusted Net Income as net income adjusted to eliminate certain non-cash charges and other items that we do not consider to be indicative of our core/ongoing operations and adjusted for the impact to income tax expense (benefit) related to non-GAAP adjustments. For a reconciliation of Adjusted Net Income, see “Non-GAAP Measures” below. COVID-19 Pandemic The outbreak of a novel coronavirus throughout the world, including the United States, during early calendar year 2020 caused widespread business and economic disruption through mandated and voluntary business closings and restrictions on the movement and activities of people (“COVID-19 Pandemic”). We are subject to risks and uncertainties as a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on our business is highly uncertain and difficult to predict, as the response to the COVID-19 Pandemic is still evolving in many countries, including the United States and other markets where we operate. Capital markets and economies worldwide have been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 Pandemic, and it has caused economic downturns or recessions in the United States and other markets where we operate. Policymakers around the world continue to respond with fiscal and monetary policy actions to support the economy. The magnitude and overall effectiveness of these actions remains uncertain. Impact to Operations To balance wholesale production with the then anticipated impacts to retail demand caused by the economic impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic, we reduced production in February 2020 and, in late March 2020, temporarily suspended manufacturing operations at all of our facilities to protect the health of our employees and comply with governmental mandates. As a result of these actions, we temporarily laid off nearly all our hourly workforce. We paid lump sum severance payments to certain of our laid off employees and provided for the temporary continuation of their healthcare benefits, resulting in charges totaling approximately $1.4 million during the fiscal third and fourth quarters (the “COVID-19 Shutdown Costs”). We also initiated cash management strategies to conserve liquidity during the shutdown period. We resumed operations at reduced production levels at our manufacturing facilities by mid-May 2020 and we are continuing to ramp up production. Our facilities resumed operations with new temperature screening, social distancing, personal 31 protective equipment, and cleaning protocols to pr otect our employees and mitigate risk of further business interruption. We continue to evaluate and monitor the health and safety of our employees and will adhere to federal and local government mandates and guidelines. The disruptions caused by the COVID- 19 Pandemic , including the temporary manufacturing suspension and supplier and workforce constraints, resulted in a decline in wholesale unit sales volume of nearly 50% during the February 2020 to June 2020 period as compared to the same prior-year period . An impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets was triggered as of March 29, 2020, due to the economic outlook at that time, the significant declines in our share price, market volatility and the disruption in our operations. As a result of the analysis, we recorded impairment charges totaling $56.4 million related to the NauticStar and Crest segments (the “Impairment Charges”). The Impairment Charges were principally a result of a decline, in the fiscal third quarter, in market conditions, including our share price, and the outlook for retail and wholesale sales and operating performance, as of March 29, 2020, relative to our acquisition plans and annual impairment test performed as of June 30, 2019. See Note 6 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding the Impairment Charges. As governmental restrictions were lifted, demand in the U.S. retail marine market accelerated in May and through June 2020 resulting in strong retail demand for our boats which we are seeing continue through the key summer selling season. This increase in demand, coupled with our production shutdowns, pushed retail inventory levels for all our brands to record lows as of June 30, 2020. We ended fiscal 2020 with retail inventory levels for our brands between 40 percent to 50 percent lower than at the end of fiscal 2019. Impact to Liquidity and Capital Resources On March 19, 2020, we drew $35.0 million on our revolving credit agreement as a precautionary measure in order to increase our cash position and preserve financial flexibility in light of uncertainty in the global markets resulting from the COVID-19 Pandemic. Additionally, on May 7, 2020, we entered into Amendment No. 3 (the “Amendment”) to the Fourth Amended & Restated Credit and Guarantee Agreement (the “Credit Facility”) to strengthen our financial flexibility. Among other things, the changes effected by the Amendment provide temporary relief under our financial covenants. See Note 8 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding these changes. The performance of the business and our cash management activities provided the flexibility to repay $25.0 million of the revolving credit facility as of June 30, 2020 and we ended fiscal 2020 with what we believe to be a strong liquidity position. As of June 30, 2020, we were in compliance with our financial covenants under the Amendment to the Credit Facility. Outlook We believe strong marine retail demand, coupled with record low retail inventory levels for all our brands have created a growth opportunity for fiscal 2021 and potentially into future years. We are continuing to ramp up production at our facilities and we expect this ramp up phase to continue through fiscal 2021 in order to meet strong wholesale demand as our dealers seek to satisfy current retail order flow and replenish their stock inventory. As we navigate the unprecedented confluence of demand and disruption precipitated by the COVID-19 Pandemic, our production during this ramp up period will depend, in large part, on our suppliers’ capacity and our ability to grow and maintain a high-performing workforce. Although the consumer responses to the COVID-19 Pandemic have thus far resulted in strong demand for our products, significant uncertainty exists in the economy as a result of the unpredictable outlook for the COVID-19 Pandemic. The ultimate severity of the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on our business will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the duration, spread, severity, and impact of the pandemic, the remedial action and stimulus measures adopted by local and federal governments, the effects of the pandemic on our consumers, dealers, suppliers and workforce, and to the extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume and be sustained within the general economy, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. Our future results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity could be adversely impacted by delays in payments of outstanding receivable amounts beyond normal payment terms, supply chain or workforce disruptions and uncertain demand, additional manufacturing suspensions, additional other intangible asset impairment charges, and the impact of any initiatives that we may undertake to address financial and operational challenges faced by us and our consumers, dealers, and suppliers. Please see Item 1A, “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Business – The COVID-19 Pandemic has had, and may continue to have, certain negative impacts on our business and those of our consumers, dealers and suppliers, and such impacts may have a material adverse effect on our operations and business” and “—General economic conditions, particularly in the U.S., affect our industry, demand for our products and our business, and results of operations.” 32 Overview of Results of Operations Net sales were $363.1 million for fiscal 2020, a decrease of 22.2 percent from fiscal 2019, due to lower wholesale unit volumes as a result of the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 Pandemic, including our temporary manufacturing suspension, our pre- COVID-19 Pandemic effort to allow our dealers to right-size pipeline inventory levels, and pre- COVID-19 Pandemic softness in the overall saltwater fishing category. This decline was partially offset by the inclusion of Crest, which was acquired during the second quarter of 2019, higher average wholesale prices for all our reportable segments, fiscal 2020 Aviara sales included in our MasterCraft segment, and lower dealer incentives. Gross profit for fiscal 2020 decreased 33.4 percent from fiscal 2019, primarily due to lower wholesale unit sales volume for each reportable segment, higher depreciation expense, and $1.4 million in COVID-19 Shutdown Costs. This decline was partially offset by price increases for each reportable segment, the inclusion of Crest’s first quarter 2020 results, and lower dealer incentives. Gross margin decreased by 3.5 percentage points to 20.8 percent for fiscal 2020 from 24.3 percent for fiscal 2019, primarily due to lower overhead absorption driven by lower wholesale unit sales volume for each reportable segment, and $1.4 million of COVID-19 Shutdown Costs. Net loss was $24.0 million for fiscal 2020, compared to Net income of $21.4 million for fiscal 2019. Diluted net loss per share was $1.28, compared to Diluted net income per share of $1.14 for fiscal 2019. Net loss for fiscal 2020 included Goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges of $56.4 million, or $(3.01) per diluted share. Net income for fiscal 2019 included Goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges of $31.0 million, or $(1.65) per diluted share. CEO Transition On October 30, 2019, our Board of Directors appointed Frederick A. Brightbill, Chairman of the Board of Directors, interim Chief Executive Officer. On December 2, 2019, Mr. Brightbill was named permanent Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Brightbill replaced Terry McNew, who resigned on October 30, 2019. Aviara Brand Launch We began selling boats under the Aviara brand during the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Aviara boats are designed, engineered, and manufactured to meet the exacting specifications of consumers seeking the ultimate luxury recreational day boat experience. The brand’s first model, the AV32, began selling during the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and the AV36 began selling during the second quarter of fiscal 2020. In February 2020, we launched the third Aviara model, the AV40, which we expect to begin selling in the first half of fiscal 2021. Aviara is built in our MasterCraft facility and is part of the MasterCraft reportable segment. 33 Results of Operations The consolidated statements of operations presented below should be read together with “Selected Consolidated Financial Data,” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.

Fiscal 2020 Compared to Fiscal 2019 Net Sales . Net Sales for fiscal 2020 were $363.1 million, a decrease of $103.3 million, or 22.2 percent, compared to $466.4 million for fiscal 2019. The decrease was primarily due to: • A $65.4 million decrease for the MasterCraft segment, primarily due to lower wholesale unit volumes for the MasterCraft brand as a result of our temporary manufacturing suspension and our pre- COVID-19 Pandemic effort to reduce dealer inventory levels, partially offset by a richer mix of higher-priced and higher-contented models and lower dealer incentives. The lower dealer incentives were primarily related to discounts for our Canadian dealers as the Canadian retaliatory import tariffs on boats, first imposed in July 2018, were rescinded in May 2019 and lower rebates and discounts in the fiscal fourth quarter driven by strong retail demand. Within the MasterCraft segment, the decrease for the MasterCraft brand was also partially offset by Aviara sales in fiscal 2020; • a $23.1 million decrease for the NauticStar segment primarily as a result of our temporary manufacturing suspension, our pre- COVID-19 Pandemic effort to allow our dealers to right-size pipeline inventory levels, and softness in the overall saltwater category during the first half of fiscal 2020, partially offset by higher prices; 34 • a net $14.9 million decrease as the Crest acquisition in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 added net sales of $18.9 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 which was offset by a total $33.7 million period-over-period decrease attributable to the remaining quarters in fiscal 2020 primarily as a result of our temporary manufacturing suspensi on and our pre- COVID-19 P andemic effort to allow our dealers to right-size pipeline inventory levels, and higher pre-pandemic retail rebate discounts , partially offset by higher prices ; Gross Profit and Gross Margin. Gross profit decreased $37.8 million, or 33.4 percent, to $75.4 million compared to $113.1 million for the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to lower wholesale unit sales volume for each reportable segment, higher depreciation expense, and $1.4 million in COVID-19 Shutdown Costs. The higher depreciation expense was largely a result of investment in tooling for Aviara and NauticStar to support recent product launches and lineup expansion. These decreases were partially offset by price increases for each reportable segment, $2.6 million of gross profit attributable to Crest’s first quarter of fiscal 2020 results, and lower dealer incentives. Gross margin decreased primarily due to lower overhead absorption driven by lower wholesale unit sales volume for each reportable segment, higher warranty costs as a percentage of sales, and $1.4 million of COVID-19 Shutdown Costs. Operating Expenses . Operating expenses increased $22.1 million, or 27.6 percent, to $101.9 million for fiscal 2020 compared to $79.9 million for fiscal 2019. The increase was primarily driven by additional goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges related to our NauticStar and Crest segments recorded in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019. See Note 6 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the impairment charges. In addition, the inclusion of Crest’s results for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 added $2.2 million of operating expenses, as Crest was acquired in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. This increase was partially offset by a $3.9 million decrease at our MasterCraft segment mainly due to lower acquisition-related costs, reduced Selling and marketing and General and administrative expense resulting from cost management initiatives, lower share-based compensation expense as a result of our CEO transition and lowered performance estimates related to our incentive-based compensation plan. Interest Expense . Interest expense decreased $1.5 million, or 22.5 percent, primarily driven by lower effective interest rates during the year compared to fiscal 2019. Income Tax Expense (Benefit) . Our consolidated effective income tax rate increased to 23.9 percent for fiscal 2020 from 20.2 percent for fiscal 2019, primarily due to favorable adjustments occurring in fiscal 2019, such as permanent benefits and changes in valuation allowances, which reduced the effective tax rate for fiscal 2019. 35 Non-GAAP Measures EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin We define EBITDA as earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA further adjusted to eliminate certain non-cash charges or other items that we do not consider to be indicative of our core and/or ongoing operations. For the periods presented herein, these adjustments include Goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges, Aviara (new brand) startup costs, COVID-19 Shutdown Costs, transaction expenses associated with acquisitions and certain non-cash items including share-based compensation, an out-of-period adjustment to correct an immaterial error related to our warranty reserve, and acquisition-related inventory step-up adjustments. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA expressed as a percentage of Net sales. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income Per Share We define Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share as net income adjusted to eliminate certain non-cash charges or other items that we do not consider to be indicative of our core and/or ongoing operations and adjusted for the impact to income tax expense (benefit) related to non-GAAP adjustments. For the periods presented herein, these adjustments include Goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges, Aviara (new brand) startup costs, COVID-19 Shutdown Costs, transaction expenses associated with acquisitions, and certain non-cash items including other intangible asset amortization, share-based compensation, out-of-period adjustment to correct an immaterial error related to our warranty reserve, and acquisition-related inventory step-up adjustments. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted Net Income per share, which we refer to collectively as the Non-GAAP Measures, are not measures of net income or operating income as determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. The Non-GAAP Measures are not measures of performance in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, net income per share, or operating cash flows determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of cash flow. We believe that the inclusion of the Non-GAAP Measures is appropriate to provide additional information to investors because securities analysts and investors use the Non-GAAP Measures to assess our operating performance across periods on a consistent basis and to evaluate the relative risk of an investment in our securities. We use Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share to facilitate a comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis from period to period that, when viewed in combination with our results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than does U.S. GAAP measures alone. We believe Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share assists our board of directors, management, investors, and other users of the financial statements in comparing our net income on a consistent basis from period to period because it removes certain non-cash items and other items that we do not consider to be indicative of our core and/or ongoing operations and adjusts for the impact to income tax expense (benefit) related to non-GAAP adjustments. The Non-GAAP Measures have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are: • Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; • Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; • Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; • Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our tax expense or any cash requirements to pay income taxes; • Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest payments on our indebtedness; and • Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Net Income per share, and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters we do not consider to be indicative of our core and/or ongoing operations, but may nonetheless have a material impact on our results of operations. In addition, because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of the Non-GAAP Measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, including companies in our industry. 36 The following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss) as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP to EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA m argin for the periods indicated: (Dollars in thousands) 2020 2019 2018 Net income (loss) $ (24,047 ) $ 21,354 $ 39,653 Income tax expense (benefit) (7,565 ) 5,392 12,856 Interest expense 5,045 6,513 3,474 Depreciation and amortization 10,527 7,787 5,086 EBITDA (16,040 ) 41,046 61,069 Goodwill and other intangible asset impairment (a) 56,437 31,000 — Aviara start-up costs (b) 1,446 2,840 561 COVID-19 Shutdown Costs (c) 1,394 — — Share-based compensation 1,061 1,678 1,186 Warranty adjustment (d) — — (1,033 ) Transaction expense (e) — 2,377 1,744 Inventory step-up adjustment - acquisition related (f) — 382 501 Adjusted EBITDA $ 44,298 $ 79,323 $ 64,028 Adjusted EBITDA margin 12.2 % 17.0 % 19.2 % (a) Represents non-cash charges recorded in the NauticStar and Crest segments for impairment of goodwill and trade name intangible assets.

(d) Represents an out-of-period adjustment to correct an immaterial error related to our warranty accrual calculation identified during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. (e) Represents acquisition related costs and other integration costs associated with our acquisitions of Crest and NauticStar in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. (f) Represents post-acquisition adjustment to cost of goods sold for the fair value step up of inventory acquired all of which was sold during respective fiscal years. (g) Reflects income tax expense at a tax rate of 23.0% for fiscal 2020, 22.5% for fiscal 2019 and 29% for 2018. ( h ) Reflects the impact of rounding in the other adjustments presented. Change in Non-GAAP Financial Measure Prior to fiscal year 2020, the Company’s calculation of a diluted per share amount of Adjusted Net Income included an adjustment to fully dilute this non-GAAP measure for all outstanding share-based compensation grants. This additional dilution was incorporated by adjusting the GAAP measure, Weighted Average Shares Used for the Computation of Basic earnings (loss) per share, as presented on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, to include a dilutive effect for all outstanding RSAs, PSUs, and stock options. Beginning with the fiscal year 2020 presentation in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for all periods presented, the Company will no longer include this additional dilution impact in its calculation of Adjusted Net Income per diluted share. The Company has instead utilized the Weighted Average Shares Used for the Computation of Basic and Diluted earnings (loss) per share as presented on the Consolidated Statements of Operations to calculate Adjusted Net Income per diluted share for all periods presented herein. The Company believes that, because its outstanding share-based compensation grants no longer result in a material amount of dilution of its earnings as was the case nearer to the date of our IPO, the adjustment methodology previously used no longer provides meaningful information to management or other users of its financial statements. This change resulted in an increase of $0.02 in the year ended June 30, 2020 in the amount of Adjusted Net Income per diluted share from what would have been reported using the previous methodology. The change also resulted in an increase of $0.01 in each of the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 in the amount of Adjusted Net Income per diluted share from what was previously reported. In addition, the fiscal 2019 amount for Transaction expense, in the reconciliation of net income (loss) per diluted share to Adjusted net income per diluted share, decreased by $0.01 from what was previously reported as a result of a change in the presentation of the impact of rounding. 39 Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary liquidity and capital resource needs are to finance working capital, fund capital expenditures, and service our debt. Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash balance, cash generated from operating activities, our revolving credit agreement and the refinancing and/or new issuance of long-term debt. On March 19, 2020, we drew $35.0 million on our revolving credit agreement as a precautionary measure in order to increase our cash position and preserve financial flexibility in light of uncertainty in the global markets resulting from the COVID-19 Pandemic. The performance of the business and our cash management activities provided the flexibility to repay $25.0 million of the revolving credit facility on June 30, 2020. As of June 30, 2020, we had a cash balance of $16.3 million in addition to $25.0 million of available borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility. Additionally, on May 7, 2020, we entered into Amendment No. 3 to the Fourth Amended & Restated Credit and Guarantee Agreement (the “Amendment”) to strengthen our financial flexibility. Among other things, the changes effected by the Amendment provide temporary relief under our financial covenants. See Note 8 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding these changes. On August 13, 2020, the Company entered into an agreement to purchase certain real and personal property located in Merritt Island, Florida, for $14.0 million (the “Purchase Agreement”). The Purchase Agreement is subject to customary closing conditions and closing is expected to occur in October 2020. The Company expects to use liquidity sources existing as of June 30, 2020 to fund this purchase. See Note 7 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding the Purchase Agreement. We believe our cash balance, cash from operations, and our ability to borrow, will be sufficient to provide for our liquidity and capital resource needs. However, we are continuing to monitor the COVID-19 Pandemic and its impact on our business, dealers, consumers and industry as a whole. Please see Item 1A, “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Business – The COVID-19 Pandemic has had, and may continue to have, certain negative impacts on our business and those of our consumers, dealers and suppliers, and such impacts may have a material adverse effect on our operations and business.” The following table summarizes the cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities: (Dollars in thousands) 2020 2019 2018 Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 30,198 $ 55,886 $ 49,397 Investing activities (14,218 ) (95,786 ) (85,720 ) Financing activities (5,487 ) 37,817 40,194 Net change in cash $ 10,493 $ (2,083 ) $ 3,871 Cash Flow Our net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $25.7 million, or 46.0%, to $30.2 million for fiscal 2020 from $55.9 million in fiscal 2019. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in operating income, net of non-cash expense items, and unfavorable working capital usage. Working capital is defined as Accounts receivable, Income tax receivable, Inventories, and Prepaid expenses and other current assets net of Accounts payable, Income tax payable, and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities as presented in the consolidated balance sheets, excluding the impact of acquisitions and non-cash adjustments. Cash flows from working capital changes decreased primarily due to: • a $12.1 million decrease related to Accrued expenses and other current liabilities as a result of changes in the timing of dealer incentive payments, higher retail sales in June 2020 as compared to June 2019 which lowered certain accrued dealer incentives, and lower accrued payroll as a result of lower incentive compensation accruals; • a $3.0 million decrease related to Income tax receivable is primarily due to the decreased taxable income between the comparable periods; • a $3.9 million decrease attributable to Accounts payable as a result of lower production levels in June 2020 as compared to June 2019 and the timing of vendor payments; • partially offset by a $8.1 million increase related to Accounts receivable primarily due to lower sales volumes in June 2020 as compared to June 2019 and an improved collection cycle for Crest; and • a $5.2 million increase attributable to Inventories as high wholesale demand resulted in low finished goods levels, while lower production rates in June 2020 as compared to June 2019 resulted in lower raw materials and work-in-process inventories. 40 Net cash used in investing activities decreased primarily due to the $81.7 million Crest acquisition being included in our 2019 cash flows. Capital outlays of $14.2 million during the year ended June 30, 2020 included the purchase of the Crest manufacturing facility, expansion activities, molds, and equipment. See Note 1 1 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regardi ng the Crest facility purchase. Net financing cash flow decreased primarily as the result of lower proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt. The Crest acquisition, completed during the second quarter of 2019, was funded using $80.0 million of proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt. On March 20, 2020, we borrowed all available funds under our Revolving Credit Facility, $35.0 million, as a precautionary measure in response to the COVID-19 Pandemic and we had repaid $25.0 million as of June 30, 2020. During the year ended June 30, 2020, we also made $15.4 million of principal payments on our term loans, including $6.0 million of voluntary prepayments. See Note 8 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding our debt and liquidity. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company did not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements as of June 30, 2020. Contractual Obligations As of June 30, 2020, the Company’s contractual cash obligations were as follows: Payments Due by Period Less than More than (Dollars in thousands) Total 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years 5 years Long-Term Debt Obligations (1) $ 109,993 $ 9,420 $ 24,335 $ 76,238 $ — Interest on Long-Term Debt Obligations (2) 11,843 4,105 6,995 743 — Operating Lease Obligations 530 245 284 1 — Purchase Obligations (3) 82,848 16,325 31,365 35,158 — Other 315 183 132 — — Total Contractual Obligations (4) $ 205,529 $ 30,278 $ 63,111 $ 112,140 $ — (1) See Note 8 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Company's debt. “Long-Term Debt Obligations” refers to future cash principal payments. (2) Interest payments on variable rate debt instruments were calculated using June 30, 2020 interest rates and holding them constant for the life of the instruments. (3) Purchase obligations represent agreements with suppliers and vendors entered into as part of the normal course of business, including engine purchase commitments. (4) Unrecognized tax benefits of $3.7 million are not reflected in this table because the Company cannot predict when open income tax years will close with completed examinations. See Note 9 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Repurchase Obligations — The Company has reserves to cover potential losses associated with repurchase obligations based on historical experience and current facts and circumstances. We incurred no material impact from repurchase events during fiscal 2020, 2019, or 2018. An adverse change in retail sales, however, could require us to repurchase boats repossessed by floor plan financing companies upon an event of default by any of our dealers, subject in some cases to an annual limitation. See Note 11 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for more information related to our obligations under floor plan financing agreements. Emerging Growth Company We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act. For as long as we are an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding stockholder advisory “say-on-pay” votes on executive compensation and stockholder advisory votes on golden parachute compensation. The JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can utilize the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Pursuant to Section 107 of the JOBS Act, we have irrevocably chosen to opt out of such extended transition period and, as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for companies that are not “emerging growth companies.” 41 We will continue to be an emerging growth company until June 30, 2021, which is the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of completion of our initial public offer ing . Inflation The market prices of certain materials and components used in manufacturing our products, especially resins that are made with hydrocarbon feedstocks, copper, aluminum, and stainless steel, can be volatile. Historically, however, inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations. Significant increases in inflation, particularly those related to wages and increases in the cost of raw materials, could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. New boat buyers often finance their purchases. Inflation typically results in higher interest rates that could translate into an increased cost of boat ownership. Should inflation and increased interest rates occur, prospective consumers may choose to forego or delay their purchases or buy a less expensive boat in the event credit is not available to finance their boat purchases. Critical Accounting Policies A “critical accounting policy” is one which is both important to the understanding of our financial condition and results of operations and requires management’s most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results could differ from those estimates and cause our reported net income (loss) to vary significantly from period to period. We believe that the policies listed below involve the greatest degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, we believe these are the most critical to understand in order to evaluate fully our financial condition and results of operations. For additional information regarding these policies, see Note 1 — Significant Accounting Policies in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets — The Company does not amortize goodwill and other purchased intangible assets with indefinite lives. All of the Company’s goodwill and other intangible assets relate to our MasterCraft, NauticStar, or Crest reporting units (see Note 13 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The Company’s intangible assets with finite lives consist primarily of dealer networks and are carried at their estimated fair values at the time of acquisition, less accumulated amortization. Amortization is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets (see Note 6 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Intangible assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment using a process similar to that used to evaluate long-lived assets described below. Goodwill Goodwill results from the excess of purchase price over the net assets of businesses acquired. The Company reviews goodwill for impairment annually, at fiscal yearend, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit may be below its carrying value. As part of the annual test, the Company may perform a qualitative, rather than quantitative, assessment to determine whether the fair values of its reporting units are “more likely than not” to be greater than their carrying values. In performing this qualitative analysis, the Company considers various factors, including the effect of market or industry changes and the reporting units' actual results compared to projected results. If the fair value of a reporting unit does not meet the ""more likely than not"" criteria discussed above, the impairment test for goodwill is a quantitative test. This test involves comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, goodwill is not considered impaired. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value then the goodwill is considered impaired and an impairment loss is recognized in an amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of the goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. 42 The Company calculates the fair value of its reporting units considering both the income approach and mar ket approach. The income approach calculates the fair value of the reporting unit using a discounted cash flow approach. Internally forecasted future cash flows, which the Company believes reasonably approximate market participant assumptions, are discount ed using a weighted average cost of capital (“Discount Rate”) developed for each reporting unit. The Discount Rate is developed using market observable inputs, as well as considering whether or not there is a measure of risk related to the specific reporti ng unit’s forecasted performance. Fair value under the market approach is determined for each unit by applying market multiples for comparable public companies to the unit’s financial results. The key uncertainties in these calculations are the assumptions used in determining the reporting unit’s forecasted future performance, including revenue growth and operating margins, as well as the perceived risk associated with those forecasts in determining the Discount Rate, along with selecting representative mar ket multiples. As of June 30, 2020, only the Mastercraft reporting unit has a goodwill balance. The fair value of this reporting unit substantially exceeds its carrying value. However, it is possible that the Company’s assumptions regarding the key uncertainties in this fair value calculation could change in the near term. If actual results differ from the Company’s assumptions, it is possible that the MasterCraft reporting unit could incur goodwill impairment charges in future periods. Other Intangible Assets The Company's primary intangible assets other than goodwill are dealer networks and trade names acquired in business combinations. These intangible assets are initially valued using a methodology commensurate with the intended use of the asset. The dealer networks were valued using an income approach, which requires an estimate or forecast of the expected future cash flows from the dealer network through the application of the multi-period excess earnings approach. The fair value of trade names is measured using a relief-from-royalty approach, a variation of the income approach, which requires an estimate or forecast of the expected future cash flows. This method assumes the value of the trade name is the discounted cash flows of the amount that would be paid to third parties had the Company not owned the trade name and instead licensed the trade name from another company. The basis for future sales projections for these methods are based on internal revenue forecasts by reporting unit, which the Company believes represent reasonable market participant assumptions. The future cash flows are discounted using an applicable Discount Rate as well as any potential risk premium to reflect the inherent risk of holding a standalone intangible asset. The key uncertainties in these fair value calculations, as applicable, are: assumptions used in developing internal revenue growth and dealer expense forecasts, assumed dealer attrition rates, the selection of an appropriate royalty rate, as well as the perceived risk associated with those forecasts in determining the Discount Rate. The costs of amortizable intangible assets, including dealer networks, are recognized over their expected useful lives, approximately ten years for the dealer networks, using the straight-line method. Intangible assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment using a process similar to that used to evaluate long-lived assets described below. Intangible assets not subject to amortization are assessed for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that an asset may be impaired. The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset. During the third quarter of fiscal 2020, impairment charges were incurred for the NauticStar and Crest trade name-related intangible assets. As of our fiscal year end, which is our annual impairment testing date under ASC 360, there have been favorable changes in circumstances as compared to those existing as of the end of the third quarter, such as strong marine retail demand coupled with record low retail inventory levels that have created a growth opportunity in the near term, which we believe indicates that it is not more likely than not that the current carrying values of these assets are higher than the fair values. Changes in assumptions and estimates such as declines in projected results, however, may affect the fair value of our intangible assets and could result in additional impairment charges in future periods. Income Taxes— We are subject to income taxes in the United States of America and the United Kingdom. Our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rates, primarily due to changes in the valuation allowance and non-deductible expenses, as further described in Note 9 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, we cannot provide assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest. 43 Significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. In the event that we change our determin ation as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. Realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income in future periods. If future events cause us to conclude that it is not more likely than not that we will be able to recover the value of our deferred tax assets, we are required to establish a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets at that time. Revenue Recognition — The Company’s revenue is derived primarily from the sale of boats and trailers, marine parts, and accessories to its independent dealers. The Company recognizes revenue when obligations under the terms of a contract are satisfied and control over promised goods is transferred to a customer. For the majority of sales, this occurs when the product is released to the carrier responsible for transporting it to a customer. The Company typically receives payment within 5 business days of shipment. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration it expects to receive in exchange for a product. The Company offers dealer incentives that include wholesale rebates, retail rebates and promotions, floor plan reimbursement or cash discounts, and other allowances that are recorded as reductions of revenues in Net sales in the consolidated statements of operations. The consideration recognized represents the amount specified in a contract with a customer, net of estimated incentives the Company reasonably expects to pay. The estimated liability and reduction in revenue for dealer incentives is recorded at the time of sale. Subsequent adjustments to incentive estimates are possible because actual results may differ from these estimates if conditions dictate the need to enhance or reduce sales promotion and incentive programs or if dealer achievement or other items vary from historical trends. Accrued dealer incentives are included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Rebates and Discounts Dealers earn wholesale rebates based on purchase volume commitments and achievement of certain performance metrics. The Company estimates the amount of wholesale rebates based on historical achievement, forecasted volume, and assumptions regarding dealer behavior. Rebates that apply to boats already in dealer inventory are referred to as retail rebates. The Company estimates the amount of retail rebates based on historical data for specific boat models adjusted for forecasted sales volume, product mix, dealer and consumer behavior, and assumptions concerning market conditions. The Company also utilizes various programs whereby it offers cash discounts or agrees to reimburse its dealers for certain floor plan interest costs incurred by dealers for limited periods of time, generally ranging up to nine months. Other Revenue Recognition Matters Dealers generally have no right to return unsold boats. Occasionally, the Company may accept returns in limited circumstances and at the Company’s discretion under its warranty policy. The Company may be obligated, in the event of default by a dealer, to accept returns of unsold boats under its repurchase commitment to floor financing providers, who are able to obtain such boats through foreclosure. The repurchase commitment is on an individual unit basis with a term from the date it is financed by the lending institution through the payment date by the dealer, generally not exceeding 30 months. The Company accounts for these arrangements as guarantees and recognizes a liability based on the estimated fair value of the repurchase obligation. The estimated fair value takes into account our estimate of the loss we will incur upon resale of any repurchases. The Company accrues the estimated fair value of this obligation based on the age of inventory currently under floor plan financing and estimated credit quality of dealers holding the inventory. Inputs used to estimate this fair value include significant unobservable inputs that reflect the Company’s assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use and, therefore, this liability is classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Product Warranties — The Company offers warranties on the sale of certain products for periods of between one and five years. These warranties require us or our dealers to repair or replace defective products during the warranty period at no cost to the consumer. We estimate the costs that may be incurred under our basic limited warranty and record as a liability the amount of such costs at the time the product revenue is recognized. The key uncertainties that affect our estimate for warranty liability include anticipated rates of warranty claims and cost per claim. We periodically assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as actual claims are determined or as changes in the obligations become reasonably estimable. Repurchase Agreements — In connection with our dealers’ wholesale floor plan financing of boats, we have entered into repurchase agreements with various lending institutions. The repurchase commitment is on an individual unit basis with a term from the date it is financed by the lending institution through payment date by the dealer, generally not exceeding 30 months. Such agreements are customary in the industry and our exposure to loss under such agreements is limited by the resale value of the inventory which is required to be repurchased. We incurred no material impact from repurchase events during fiscal 2020, 2019, or 2018. 44 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATI VE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. Market risk represents the risk of changes in the value of market risk sensitive instruments caused by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, interest rates, and commodity prices. Changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in the results of our operations and cash flows. In the ordinary course of business, we are primarily exposed to interest rate risks. As of June 30, 2020, we had $108.6 million of long-term debt outstanding, bearing interest at the effective interest rate of 3.75%. See Note 8 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding our long-term debt. A hypothetical 1% increase or decrease in interest rates would have resulted in a $1.8 million change to our interest expense for fiscal 2020. ITEM 8. FINANCI AL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA. The financial statements and supplementary financial information required to be filed under this Item 8 are presented in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K. ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE. None. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. As of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-K Annual Report, we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level as of June 30, 2020. Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2020. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (""COSO"") in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) . Based on such assessment our management has concluded that, as of June 30, 2020, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria. This annual report does not include an attestation report from our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management's assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the SEC that permit emerging growth companies, which we are, to provide only management's assessment in this annual report. 45 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f), during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

F-6 MASTERCRAFT BOAT HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unless otherwise noted, dollars in thousands, except per share data and per unit data) 1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Organization – MasterCraft Boat Holdings, Inc. (“Holdings”) was formed on January 28, 2000, as a Delaware holding company and operates primarily through its wholly owned subsidiaries, MasterCraft Boat Company, LLC; MasterCraft Services, LLC; MasterCraft Parts, Ltd.; and MasterCraft International Sales Administration, Inc. (collectively “MasterCraft”); Nautic Star, LLC and NS Transport, LLC (collectively “NauticStar”); and Crest Marine, LLC (“Crest”). The Company acquired NauticStar on October 2, 2017 and Crest on October 1, 2018. Holdings and its subsidiaries collectively are referred to herein as the “Company.” Segment Information — Operating segments are identified as components of an enterprise about which discrete financial information is available for evaluation by the chief operating decision maker in making decisions on how to allocate resources and assess performance. The Company views its operations in three operating segments based on its operations and management structures: MasterCraft, NauticStar, and Crest (see Note 13). Basis of Presentation – The accompanying financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries from the dates of their acquisitions. Principles of Consolidation — The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Holdings has no independent operations and no material assets, other than its wholly owned equity interests of MasterCraft, NauticStar, and Crest, which totaled $163.0 million as of June 30, 2020 and 2019, and no material liabilities. As of June 30, 2020, Holdings had no material contingencies, long-term obligations, or guarantees other than a guarantee of the Company’s subsidiaries’ long-term debt (see Note 8). Use of Estimates — The preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and related disclosures. The Company bases these estimates on historical results and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable. The Company’s most significant financial statement estimates include warranty liability, dealer incentives liability, fair value of share-based compensation, inventory repurchase contingent obligation, unrecognized tax positions, impairment of long-lived assets and intangible assets subject to amortization, impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, and potential litigation claims and settlements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Reclassifications — Certain historical amounts have been reclassified in the accompanying consolidated financial statements to conform to the current presentation. Revenue Recognition — The Company’s revenue is derived primarily from the sale of boats and trailers, marine parts, and accessories to its independent dealers. The Company recognizes revenue when obligations under the terms of a contract are satisfied and control over promised goods is transferred to a customer. For the majority of sales, this occurs when the product is released to the carrier responsible for transporting it to a customer. The Company typically receives payment within 5 business days of shipment. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration it expects to receive in exchange for a product. The Company offers dealer incentives that include wholesale rebates, retail rebates and promotions, floor plan reimbursement or cash discounts, and other allowances that are recorded as reductions of revenues in Net sales in the consolidated statements of operations. The consideration recognized represents the amount specified in a contract with a customer, net of estimated incentives the Company reasonably expects to pay. The estimated liability and reduction in revenue for dealer incentives is recorded at the time of sale. Subsequent adjustments to incentive estimates are possible because actual results may differ from these estimates if conditions dictate the need to enhance or reduce sales promotion and incentive programs or if dealer achievement or other items vary from historical trends. Accrued dealer incentives are included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Rebates and Discounts Dealers earn wholesale rebates based on purchase volume commitments and achievement of certain performance metrics. The Company estimates the amount of wholesale rebates based on historical achievement, forecasted volume, and assumptions regarding dealer behavior. Rebates that apply to boats already in dealer inventory are referred to as retail rebates. The Company estimates the amount of retail rebates based on historical data for specific boat models adjusted for forecasted sales volume, product mix, dealer and consumer F-7 behavior, and assumptions concerning market conditions. The Company also utilizes va rious programs whereby it offers cash discounts or agrees to reimburse its dealers for certain floor plan interest costs incurred by dealers for limited periods of time, generally ranging up to nine months. Shipping and Handling Costs Shipping and handling costs includes those costs incurred to transport product to customers and internal handling costs, which relate to activities to prepare goods for shipment . The Company has elected to account for shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a customer as a fulfillment cost. The Company includes shipping and handling costs, including costs billed to customers, in Cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations. Contract Liabilities A contract liability is created when customers prepay for goods prior to the Company transferring those goods to the customer. The contract liability is reduced once control of the goods is transferred to the customer. The difference between the opening and closing balances of the Company’s contract liabilities primarily results from the timing difference between the Company’s performance and the point at which it receives pre-payment from the customer. Other Revenue Recognition Matters Dealers generally have no right to return unsold boats. Occasionally, the Company may accept returns in limited circumstances and at the Company’s discretion under its warranty policy. The Company may be obligated, in the event of default by a dealer, to accept returns of unsold boats under its repurchase commitment to floor financing providers, who are able to obtain such boats through foreclosure. The repurchase commitment is on an individual unit basis with a term from the date it is financed by the lending institution through the payment date by the dealer, generally not exceeding 30 months. The Company accounts for these arrangements as guarantees and recognizes a liability based on the estimated fair value of the repurchase obligation. The estimated fair value takes into account our estimate of the loss we will incur upon resale of any repurchases. The Company accrues the estimated fair value of this obligation based on the age of inventory currently under floor plan financing and estimated credit quality of dealers holding the inventory. Inputs used to estimate this fair value include significant unobservable inputs that reflect the Company’s assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use and, therefore, this liability is classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The Company has excluded sales and other taxes assessed by a governmental authority in connection with revenue-producing activities from the determination of the transaction price for all contracts. The Company has not adjusted Net sales for the effects of a significant financing component because the period between the transfer of the promised goods and the customer's payment is expected to be one year or less. Accounts Receivable — Accounts receivable represents amounts billed to customers under credit terms customary in its industry. The Company normally does not charge interest on its accounts receivable. The Company determines its allowance for doubtful accounts by considering a number of factors, including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due, the Company’s previous loss history, the customer’s current ability to pay its obligation to the Company, and the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole. The Company writes-off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible, and payments subsequently received on such receivables are credited to bad debt recovery. Amounts recorded as bad debt expense, write-offs, and recoveries were not material for the years ended June 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018. Cash and Cash Equivalents — The Company considers all highly-liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents. The Company’s cash deposits may at times exceed federally insured amounts. The Company had no cash equivalents at June 30, 2020 and 2019. Concentrations of Credit and Business Risk — Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of trade receivables. Credit risk on trade receivables is mitigated as a result of the Company’s use of trade letters of credit, dealer floor plan financing arrangements, and the geographically diversified nature of the Company’s customer base. Supplier Concentrations The Company is dependent on the ability of its suppliers to provide products on a timely basis and on favorable pricing terms. The loss of certain principal suppliers or a significant reduction in product availability from principal suppliers could have a material adverse effect on the Company. Business risk insurance is in place to mitigate the business risk associated with sole suppliers for sudden disruptions such as those caused by natural disasters. F-8 The Company is dependent on third-party equipment manufacturers, distributors, and dealers for certain parts and materials utilized in the manufacturing process. During the years ended June 30, 2020 , 2019 , and 2018 the Company purchased all engines for its MasterCraft performance sport boats under a supply agreement with a single vendor. Total purchases to this vendor were $27.6 million , $39.3 million, and $34.7 million for the years ended June 30, 2020 , 2019 , and 2 018 , respectively. During the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 , the Company purchased a majority of engines for its NauticStar boats under a supply agreement with one vendor. Total purchases from this vendor were $15.2 million , $23.7 million, and $19.7 m illion for the years ended June 30, 2020 . 2019 , and 2018 , respectively . During the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 , the Company purchased a majority of the engines for its Crest boats under a supply agreement with a single vendor. Total purchases from this vendor were $15.5 million and $20.4 million for the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively . Inventories — Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value and are shown net of an inventory allowance in the consolidated balance sheet. Inventory cost includes material, labor, and manufacturing overhead and is determined based on the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Provisions are made as necessary to reduce inventory amounts to their net realizable value or to provide for obsolete inventory. Property, Plant, and Equipment — Property, plant, and equipment are recorded at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives. Repairs and maintenance are charged to operations as incurred, and expenditures for additions and improvements that increase the asset’s useful life are capitalized. Ranges of asset lives used for depreciation purposes are: Buildings and improvements 7 - 40 years Machinery and equipment 3 - 7 years Furniture and fixtures 3 - 7 years Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets — The Company does not amortize goodwill and other purchased intangible assets with indefinite lives. The Company’s intangible assets with finite lives consist primarily of dealer networks and are carried at their estimated fair values at the time of acquisition, less accumulated amortization. Amortization is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets (see Note 6). Intangible assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment using a process similar to that used to evaluate long-lived assets described below. All of the Company’s goodwill and other intangible assets relate to our MasterCraft, NauticStar, or Crest reporting units (see Note 13). Goodwill Goodwill results from the excess of purchase price over the net identifiable assets of businesses acquired. The Company reviews goodwill for impairment annually, at fiscal yearend, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit may be below its carrying value. As part of the annual test, the Company may perform a qualitative, rather than quantitative, assessment to determine whether the fair values of its reporting units are “more likely than not” to be greater than their carrying values. In performing this qualitative analysis, the Company considers various factors, including the effect of market or industry changes and the reporting units' actual results compared to projected results. If the fair value of a reporting unit does not meet the ""more likely than not"" criteria discussed above, the impairment test for goodwill is a quantitative test. This test involves comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, goodwill is not considered impaired. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value then the goodwill is considered impaired and an impairment loss is recognized in an amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of the goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The Company calculates the fair value of its reporting units by considering both the income approach and market approach. The income approach calculates the fair value of the reporting unit using a discounted cash flow method. Internally forecasted future cash flows, which the Company believes reasonably approximate market participant assumptions, are discounted using a weighted average cost of capital (“Discount Rate”) developed for each reporting unit. The Discount Rate is developed using observable market inputs, as well as considering whether or not there is a measure of risk related to the specific reporting unit’s forecasted performance. Fair value under the market approach is determined for each unit by applying market multiples for comparable public companies to the unit’s financial results. The key uncertainties in these calculations are the assumptions used in determining the reporting unit’s forecasted future performance, including revenue growth and operating margins, as well as the perceived risk associated with those forecasts in determining the Discount Rate, along with selecting representative market multiples. F-9 During the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company performed quantitative impairment tests for all three reporting units and determined that goodwill attributable to the NauticStar and Crest reporting units was impaired. As a result, the Company recognized associated i mpairment charges during each of those fiscal years (see Note 6) . The Company recognized no impairments related to goodwill for the year ended June 30, 2018. Other Intangible Assets The Company's primary intangible assets other than goodwill are dealer networks and trade names acquired in business combinations. These intangible assets are initially valued using a methodology commensurate with the intended use of the asset. The dealer networks were valued using an income approach, which requires an estimate or forecast of the expected future cash flows from the dealer network through the application of the multi-period excess earnings approach. The fair value of trade names is measured using a relief-from-royalty approach, a variation of the income approach, which requires an estimate or forecast of the expected future cash flows. This method assumes the value of the trade name is the discounted cash flows of the amount that would be paid to third parties had the Company not owned the trade name and instead licensed the trade name from another company. The basis for future sales projections for these methods are based on internal revenue forecasts by reporting unit, which the Company believes represent reasonable market participant assumptions. The future cash flows are discounted using an applicable Discount Rate as well as any potential risk premium to reflect the inherent risk of holding a standalone intangible asset. The key uncertainties in these fair value calculations, as applicable, are: assumptions used in developing internal revenue growth and dealer expense forecasts, assumed dealer attrition rates, the selection of an appropriate royalty rate, as well as the perceived risk associated with those forecasts in determining the Discount Rate. The costs of amortizable intangible assets, including dealer networks, are recognized over their expected useful lives, approximately ten years for the dealer networks, using the straight-line method. Intangible assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment using a process similar to that used to evaluate long-lived assets described below. Intangible assets not subject to amortization are assessed for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that an asset may be impaired. The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset. During the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company performed quantitative impairment tests for intangible assets and determined that trade names attributable to the NauticStar and Crest were impaired. As a result, the Company recognized associated impairment charges during each of those fiscal years (see Note 6). The Company recognized no impairments related to other intangible assets for the year ended June 30, 2018. Long-Lived Assets Other than Intangible Assets — The Company assesses the potential for impairment of its long-lived assets if facts and circumstances, such as declines in sales, earnings, or cash flows or adverse changes in the business climate, suggest that they may be impaired. The Company performs its review by comparing the book value of the assets to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the assets. If any impairment in the carrying value of its long-lived assets is indicated, the assets would be adjusted to an estimate of fair value. The Company incurred no such impairments during the years ended June 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018. Income Taxes — Income tax expense is the total of the current year income tax due or refundable and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Company records its global tax provision based on the respective tax rules and regulations for the jurisdictions in which it operates. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are the expected future tax amounts for the temporary differences between carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities, computed using enacted tax rates. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. Significant judgment is required in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets. The realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income. A tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is “more likely than not” that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the “more likely than not” test, no tax benefit is recorded. The Company recognizes interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. In determining the amount of current and deferred tax the Company takes into account the impact of uncertain tax positions and whether additional taxes, interest and penalties may be due. The Company believes that its accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open tax years based on its assessment of many factors, including interpretations of tax law and prior experience. This assessment relies on F-10 estimates and assumptions and may involve a ser ies of judgments about future events. New information may become available that causes the Company to change its judgment regarding the adequacy of existing tax liabilities; such changes to tax liabilities will have an impact on tax expense in the period t hat such a determination is made. The income tax effects of the differences we identify are classified as deferred tax assets and liabilities in our c onsolidated b alance s heets . Product Warranties — The Company offers warranties on the sale of certain products for periods of between one and five years. These warranties require us or our dealers to repair or replace defective products during the warranty period at no cost to the consumer. We estimate the costs that may be incurred under our basic limited warranty and record as a liability the amount of such costs at the time the product revenue is recognized. Factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of units sold, historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims, and cost per claim. We periodically assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as actual claims are determined or as changes in the obligations become reasonably estimable. Research and Development — Research and development expenditures are expensed as incurred. Research and development expense for the years ended June 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018 was $5.2 million, $5.6 million, and $4.9 million, respectively, and is included in Operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. Self-Insurance — The Company is self-insured for certain losses relating to product liability claims and employee medical claims. The Company has purchased stop-loss coverage in order to limit its exposure to any significant levels under these plans. Losses are accrued based on the Company’s estimates of the aggregate liability for self-insured claims incurred using certain actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and the Company’s historical experience. Deferred Debt Issuance Costs — Certain costs incurred to obtain financing are capitalized and amortized over the term of the related debt using the effective interest method. For the years ended June 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018 the Company incurred deferred financing costs of $0.3 million, $0.7 million, and $1.2 million, respectively. For the years ended June 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018 the Company recorded related amortization expense of $0.6 million, $0.6 million, and $0.5 million, respectively. Share-Based Compensation — The Company records amounts for all share-based compensation, including grants of restricted stock awards, performance stock units, and nonqualified stock options over the vesting period in the consolidated statements of operations based on their fair values at the date of the grant. Forfeitures of share-based compensation, if any, are recognized as they occur. Share-based compensation costs are included in Selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of Operations. See Note 10 – Share-Based Compensation for a description of the Company's accounting for share-based compensation plans. Advertising — Advertising costs are expensed when the advertising first takes place. Advertising expense recognized during the years ended June 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018, was $7.0 million, $9.3 million, and $6.8 million, respectively, and is included in Selling and marketing expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. F-11 Fair Value Measurements — The Company measures certain of its financial assets and liabilities at fair value and utilizes the established framework for measuring fair value and disclosing information about fair value measurements. Fair value is the exchange price that would be r eceived for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. There are three levels of inputs that m ay be used to measure fair values: Level 1 — Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity has the ability to access as of the measurement date. Level 2 — Significant other observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. Level 3 — Significant unobservable inputs that reflect a company’s own assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. When measuring fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. When possible, the Company looks to active and observable markets to price identical assets. When identical assets are not traded in active markets, the Company looks to market observable data for similar assets. The Company’s most significant financial asset or liability measured at fair value on a recurring basis is its inventory repurchase contingent obligation (see “Revenue Recognition - Other Revenue Recognition Matters” and Note 11). Fair Value of Financial Instruments — The carrying amounts of the Company’s financial instruments, consisting of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and other liabilities, approximate their estimated fair values due to the relative short-term nature of the amounts. The carrying amount of debt approximates fair value due to variable interest rates at customary terms and rates the Company could obtain in current financing. Earnings Per Common Share — Basic earnings per common share reflects reported earnings divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted earnings per common share include the effect of dilutive stock options and restricted share awards, unless inclusion would not be dilutive. Postretirement Benefits – The Company has a defined contribution plan and makes contributions including matching and discretionary contributions which are based on various percentages of compensation, and in some instances are based on the amount of the employees' contributions to the plans. The expense related to the defined contribution plans was $1.2 million, $1.2 million, and $0.8 million for the years ended June 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Comparability between the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 was impacted, primarily, by the acquisition of Crest and NauticStar during the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively (See Note 3). COVID-19 Pandemic — The outbreak of a novel coronavirus throughout the world, including the United States, during early calendar year 2020 has caused widespread business and economic disruption through mandated and voluntary business closings and restrictions on the movement and activities of people (“COVID-19 Pandemic”). We are subject to risks and uncertainties as a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Company's business is highly uncertain and difficult to predict, as the response to the COVID-19 Pandemic is rapidly evolving in many countries, including the United States and other markets where the Company operates. It is expected that many of the Company's consumers, dealers, and suppliers could be impacted by these closings and restrictions which could materially and adversely affect demand for our products, our ability to obtain or deliver inventory, and our ability to collect accounts receivables as our dealers and financing counterparties face higher liquidity and solvency risk. Furthermore, capital markets and economies worldwide have also been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 Pandemic, and it has caused economic downturns or recessions in the U.S. and other markets where the Company operates. Such economic disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business as retail demand for our products could decline which would in-turn reduce wholesale demand from our dealers. Policymakers around the world have responded with fiscal and monetary policy actions to support the economy. The magnitude and overall effectiveness of these actions remains uncertain. To balance wholesale production with the then anticipated impacts to retail demand caused by the economic impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic, we reduced production in February 2020 and, in late March 2020, temporarily suspended manufacturing operations at all of our facilities to protect the health of our employees and comply with governmental mandates. As a result of this action, the Company temporarily laid off nearly all of its hourly workforce. We resumed operations at all our manufacturing facilities by mid-May 2020. Our facilities resumed operations with new temperature screening, social distancing, personal protective equipment, and cleaning protocols to protect our employees and mitigate risk of further business interruption. The Company continues to evaluate and monitor the health and safety of its employees and will adhere to federal and local government mandates and guidelines. F-12 The severity of the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Company's business will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the duration, spread, severity, and impact of the pandemic, the remedial actions and stimulus measures adopted by local and federal govern ments, the effects of the pandemic on the Company's consumers , dealers , suppliers and workforce , and to the extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. The Company's future results of oper ations, cash flows, and liquidity could be adversely impacted by delays in payments of outstanding receivable amounts beyond normal payment terms, supply chain or workforce disruptions and uncertain demand, additional goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges (see Note 6), and the impact of any initiatives that the Company may undertake to address financial and operational challenges faced by it and its consumers , dealers, and suppliers. As of the date of issuance of these consolidated finan cial statements, the extent to which the COVID-19 Pandemic may materially impact the Company's financial condition, liquidity, or results of operations is uncertain. New Accounting Pronouncements Issued And Adopted Leases — In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2016-02, Leases, (“ASC 842”) which, among other things, requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for all operating leases. On July 1, 2019, the Company adopted ASC 842 and all related amendments. The Company elected the optional transition method provided by the FASB in ASU 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements , and as a result, has not restated its consolidated financial statements for prior periods presented. The Company has elected the package of practical expedients upon transition which allowed the Company to retain the lease classification for any leases that existed prior to adoption, to not reassess whether any contracts entered into prior to adoption are leases, and to not reassess initial direct costs for any leases that existed prior to adoption. In addition, the Company elected not to record on the consolidated balance sheet any lease with a term of twelve months or less. ASC 842 did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated statements of operations. The cumulative effect of the changes made to the Company's consolidated balance sheet as of July 1, 2019 for the adoption of ASC 842 was as follows: Balance as of Adjustments Balance as of June 30, 2019 Due to ASC 842 July 1, 2019 Assets Other long-term assets $ 253 $ 3,931 $ 4,184 Current liabilities Accrued expenses and other current liabilities 41,421 547 41,968 Long-term liabilities Other long-term liabilities — 3,384 3,384 The Company leases various equipment under operating lease arrangements. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at lease inception. Operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date. Because the rates implicit in the Company's lease contracts are not readily determinable, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of future payments. The incremental borrowing rate is estimated to approximate the interest rate on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments, and in economic environments where the leased asset is located. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any initial direct costs and lease payments made prior to lease commencement and excludes lease incentives incurred. The Company's lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company may enter into lease agreements that contain both lease and non-lease components, which it has elected to account for as a single lease component for all asset classes. See Note 11 for information regarding the Company’s leases. Share-Based Compensation — In June 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU 2018-07 , Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting . This guidance provides clarity and reduces complexity when applying the guidance in Topic 718, Compensation—Stock Compensation to the term or condition of share-based payments to nonemployees. ASU 2018-07 is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods therein, beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company adopted this guidance for its fiscal year beginning July 1, 2019. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. F-13 New Accounting Pronouncements Issued But Not Yet Adopted Fair Value Measurements — In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework—Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement . This guidance modifies the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements in Topic 820 by removing disclosures regarding transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, by modifying the measurement uncertainty disclosure, and by requiring additional disclosures for Level 3 fair value measurements, among others. The amendments are effective for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company does not expect the adoption of this new guidance to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. Current Expected Credit Loss — In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments , which updated the ASC to use an impairment model that is based on expected losses rather than incurred losses. The Company will adopt this guidance for its fiscal year beginning July 1, 2020. Our evaluation of this guidance is substantially complete, and the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 2. REVENUE RECOGNITION The following table presents the Company’s revenue by major product category for each reportable segment. Year Ended June 30, 2020 Year Ended June 30, 2019 MasterCraft NauticStar Crest (a) Total MasterCraft NauticStar Crest (a) Total Major Product Categories: Boats and trailers $ 236,108 $ 54,473 $ 60,888 $ 351,469 $ 301,010 $ 77,896 $ 75,742 $ 454,648 Parts 9,731 448 591 10,770 9,471 85 498 10,054 Other revenue 616 9 209 834 1,349 14 316 1,679 Total $ 246,455 $ 54,930 $ 61,688 $ 363,073 $ 311,830 $ 77,995 $ 76,556 $ 466,381 (a) Crest was acquired on October 1, 2018. Sales outside of North America accounted for 4.8%, 5.2%, and 7.5% of the Company’s net sales for the years ended June 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. The Company had no significant concentrations of sales to individual dealers or in countries outside of North America during the years ended June 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018. Contract Liabilities As of June 30, 2019, the Company had $0.8 million of contract liabilities associated with customer deposits. During the year ended June 30, 2020, all of this amount was recognized as revenue. As of June 30, 2020, total contract liabilities were $0.6 million, were reported in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet and are expected to be recognized as revenue during the year ended June 30, 2021. See Note 1 for a description of the Company’s significant revenue recognition policies. 3. ACQUISITIONS Fiscal 2019 Acquisition On October 1, 2018, the Company completed its acquisition of Crest for $81.7 million. Crest, a manufacturer of pontoons, expands the Company’s product portfolio. Proceeds from the $80.0 term loan (see Note 8) were used to fund this acquisition. The following table is a summary of the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and net cash consideration paid for Crest during fiscal 2019: F-14 Fair Value Accounts receivable $ 5,215 Inventories 9,853 Other current assets 179 Property, plant and equipment 1,840 Identifiable intangible assets (a) 35,245 Current liabilities (6,841 ) Fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 45,491 Goodwill (a) 36,238 Net cash consideration paid $ 81,729 (a) The goodwill and other intangible assets recorded for the Crest acquisition are deductible for tax purposes. Fair Value Estimated Useful Life (in years) Definite-lived intangible assets: Dealer network $ 18,000 10 Software 245 5 Indefinite-lived intangible asset: Trade name 17,000 Total identifiable intangible assets $ 35,245 Related Party Transactions In connection with the operations of Crest, the Company made rental payments to Crest Marine Real Estate LLC (“Real Estate”) for a manufacturing facility, storage and office building (the “Crest Facility”). One of the minority owners of Real Estate is a member of the Crest management team. The lease was to expire on September 30, 2028, and was subject to four consecutive, five-year renewal periods. The lease terms included an option for the Company to purchase the Crest Facility for an amount equal to its fair market value, as determined by appraisals and negotiation between the Company and Real Estate (the “Purchase Option”). The annual rent under the lease was $0.3 million for the first five years of the lease term, and was to increase to $0.4 million for the remaining five years. Additionally, at the beginning of each of the optional renewal terms the rent was to be adjusted based on the change in the Consumer Price Index. In accordance with the Purchase Option, on October 24, 2019 the Company purchased the Crest Facility for $4.1 million. See Note 11 for additional information regarding the purchase. Crest purchases fiberglass component parts from a supplier whose minority owner was the same member of the Crest management team that has a minority ownership interest in Real Estate. On January 31, 2020 this minority ownership interest was divested and this supplier ceased being a related party. During the period beginning July 1, 2019 and ending January 31, 2020, the Company purchased $1.8 million of products from the supplier. During the year ended June 30, 2019, the Company purchased $2.8 million of products from the supplier. Pro Forma Financial Information The following unaudited pro forma consolidated results of operations for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, assumes that the acquisition of NauticStar (acquired on October 2, 2017) and Crest (acquired on October 1, 2018) occurred as of the beginning of the earliest period presented in the consolidated financial statements. The unaudited pro forma financial information combines historical results of MasterCraft, NauticStar, and Crest with adjustments for depreciation and amortization attributable to fair value estimates on acquired tangible and intangible assets for the respective periods. Non-recurring pro forma adjustments associated with the fair value step up of inventory were included in the reported pro forma cost of sales and earnings. The unaudited pro forma financial information is not indicative of the results of operations that would have been achieved if the acquisitions had taken place at the beginning of fiscal year 2018, or the results that may occur in the future: Fiscal Years Ended 2019 2018 Net sales $ 487,374 $ 423,630 Net income $ 21,619 $ 38,269 Basic earnings per share $ 1.16 $ 2.06 Diluted earnings per share $ 1.15 $ 2.04 F-15 4. INVENTORIES Inventories consisted of the following: As of June 30, 2020 2019 Raw materials and supplies $ 18,318 $ 20,034 Work in process 3,866 4,571 Finished goods 4,876 7,207 Obsolescence reserve (1,424 ) (1,152 ) Total inventories $ 25,636 $ 30,660 5. PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT Property, plant, and equipment, net consisted of the following: As of June 30, 2020 2019 Land and improvements $ 3,030 $ 1,901 Buildings and improvements 22,366 15,652 Machinery and equipment 38,262 29,804 Furniture and fixtures 2,229 1,719 Construction in progress 1,312 4,866 Total property, plant, and equipment 67,199 53,942 Less accumulated depreciation (26,718 ) (20,306 ) Property, plant, and equipment, net $ 40,481 $ 33,636 Depreciation expense for the years ended June 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018 was $6.6 million, $4.3 million, and $3.5 million, respectively. Subsequent Event On August 13, 2020, the Company entered into an agreement to purchase certain real and personal property located in Merritt Island, Florida, including a 140,000 sq. ft. boat manufacturing facility, (the “Property”) for $14.0 million (the “Purchase Agreement”). The Company plans to use the Property to expand its boat building capacity. The Purchase Agreement is subject to customary closing conditions and closing is expected to occur in October 2020. The Company expects to use liquidity sources existing as of June 30, 2020 to fund this purchase. F-16 6 . GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS Goodwill and Other Intangible Asset Impairment The current economic environment, including the significant share price and market volatility, as well as disruptions to supply chains resulting from the COVID-19 Pandemic, triggered an interim impairment analysis for the Company’s intangible assets including goodwill. As a result of this analysis, the Company recorded impairment charges totaling $56.4 million during the three months ended March 29, 2020 related to the NauticStar and Crest segments. As of June 30, 2020, our annual impairment test date, the Company performed a qualitative assessment and identified no events or circumstances that indicated that there existed a more likely than not probability of impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets. The impairment charges recorded for each segment are detailed below and are included in Goodwill and other intangible asset impairment on the consolidated statement of operations. The impairment recorded in fiscal 2020 was principally a result of a decline, in the fiscal third quarter, in market conditions, including our share price, and the then current outlook for sales and operating performance relative to the Company’s acquisition plans and impairment test performed as of June 30, 2019. During our fiscal 2019 annual assessment of intangible assets including goodwill, the Company recorded impairment charges of $31.0 million related to the NauticStar segment. The impairment was principally a result of a decline, in the fiscal fourth quarter, in the outlook for sales and operating performance relative to our acquisition plan. See Note 1 for a discussion of the methods used to determine the fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets. In assessing the need for goodwill and intangible impairment, management utilizes a number of estimates, including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, transactions and marketplace data. Accordingly, these fair value measurements fall in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges for the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 were as follows: 2020 2019 NauticStar Crest Consolidated NauticStar Consolidated Goodwill $ 8,199 $ 36,238 $ 44,437 $ 28,000 $ 28,000 Trade name 5,000 7,000 12,000 3,000 3,000 Total $ 13,199 $ 43,238 $ 56,437 $ 31,000 $ 31,000 While the extent and duration of the economic impact from the COVID-19 pandemic remain unclear, changes in assumptions and estimates may affect the fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets and could result in additional impairment charges in future periods.

Beginning on April 1, 2020, the financing agreement is payable in eleven monthly installments of principal and interest of approximately $0.1 million. The agreement bears interest at 3.6%. The balance of the insurance premium financing as of June 30, 2020 was $0.7 million and is recorded in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. 8. LONG-TERM DEBT Long-term debt outstanding was as follows: As of June 30, 2020 2019 Revolving credit facility $ 10,000 $ — Term loans 99,993 115,349 Debt issuance costs on term loans (1,395 ) (1,608 ) Total debt 108,598 113,741 Less current portion of long-term debt 9,420 9,167 Less current portion of debt issuance costs on term loans (488 ) (442 ) Long-term debt, net of current portion $ 99,666 $ 105,016 Previously Existing Credit Facility On October 2, 2017, the Company entered into a Third Amended and Restated Credit and Guaranty Agreement with a syndicate of certain financial institutions (the “Third Amended Credit Agreement”). The Third Amended Credit Agreement replaced and paid off the Company’s Prior Credit Agreement, dated May 27, 2016. The Third Amended Credit Agreement provided the Company with a $145.0 million senior secured credit facility, consisting of a $115.0 million term loan and a $30.0 million revolving credit facility. A portion of the proceeds from the Third Amended Credit Agreement were used for the Company’s acquisition of NauticStar. The Third Amended Credit Agreement bore interest, at the Company’s option, at either the prime rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.75% to 1.75% or at an adjusted LIBOR plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.75% to 2.75%, in each case based on the Company’s Total Net Leverage Ratio. Current Credit Facility On October 1, 2018, the Company entered into a Fourth Amended and Restated Credit and Guaranty Agreement with a syndicate of certain financial institutions (the “Fourth Amended Credit Agreement”), which replaced the credit facility discussed above. The Fourth Amended Credit Agreement provides the Company with a $190.0 million senior secured credit facility, consisting of a $75.0 million term loan, and an $80.0 million term loan (together, the “Term Loans”), and a $35.0 million revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”). Proceeds from the $80.0 million term loan were used to fund the Crest acquisition. The Fourth Amended Credit Agreement is secured by substantially all the assets of the Company. Holdings is a guarantor on the Fourth Amended Credit Agreement and the Fourth Amended Credit Agreement contains covenants that restrict the ability of Holdings’ subsidiaries to make distributions to Holdings. The Term Loans will mature and all remaining amounts outstanding thereunder will be due and payable on October 1, 2023. F-19 Amendment to Fourth Amended Credit Agreement On May 7, 2020, the Company entered into Amendment No. 3 to the Fourth Amended Credit Agreement (the “Amendment”). The changes effected by the Amendment include, among others, the temporary removal and replacement of the Company’s financial covenants, the addition of a 50 basis point floor on LIBOR, modifications to the range of applicable LIBOR and prime interest rate margins, and a revision of the Total Net Leverage Ratio calculation. Under the Amendment, the Total Net Leverage Ratio covenant and Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio covenant of the Fourth Amended Credit Agreement are temporarily replaced with three separate covenants: (i) an Interest Coverage Ratio, (ii) a Minimum Liquidity threshold, and (iii) a Maximum Unfinanced Capital Expenditures limitation (the “Package of Financial Covenants”). The Package of Financial Covenants are in place through the quarter ended March 31, 2021, at which time the Total Net Leverage Ratio covenant and Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio covenant will be reinstated and the Package of Financial Covenants will sunset, and with the minimum liquidity covenant being tested on the last day of each fiscal month through May 31, 2021. In addition, the Total Net Leverage Ratio calculation was temporarily revised to include all unrestricted cash balances, without limitation, until June 30, 2021. Pursuant to the Amendment, the Company’s debt bore interest at LIBOR, subject to a 50 basis point floor, plus 3.25% through June 30, 2020. Beginning on July 1, 2020, the applicable margin, at the Company’s option, is at either the prime rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.5% to 2.25% or at an adjusted LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.5% to 3.25%, in each case based on the Company’s Total Net Leverage Ratio. As of June 30, 2020 and 2019, the effective interest rate on borrowings outstanding was 3.75% and 4.48%, respectively. Revolving Credit Facility On March 19, 2020, the Company drew $35.0 million on its Revolving Credit Facility as a precautionary measure in order to increase its cash position and preserve financial flexibility in light of uncertainty in the global markets resulting from the COVID-19 Pandemic. As of June 30, 2020, the Company had $10.0 million of borrowings outstanding on its Revolving Credit Facility and the availability under the Revolving Credit Facility was $25.0 million. All amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility mature in October 2023. As of June 30, 2020, the Company was in compliance with its financial covenants under the Amendment to the Fourth Amended Credit Agreement. Maturities for the Term Loans and Revolving Credit Facility subsequent to June 30, 2020 are as follows: 2021 $ 9,420 2022 11,775 2023 12,560 2024 76,238 Total $ 109,993 F-20 9 . INCOME TAXES Earnings before income taxes by jurisdiction were all in the U.S. except for income of approximately $0.1 million during each of the years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018. For the years ended June 30, the components of the provision for income taxes are as follows: 2020 2019 2018 Current income tax expense: Federal $ 2,096 $ 10,405 $ 12,140 State 666 1,892 276 Benefit of current year tax credits (554 ) (171 ) (117 ) Total current tax expense $ 2,208 $ 12,126 $ 12,299 Deferred tax (benefit) expense: Federal $ (8,887 ) $ (5,837 ) $ 525 State (886 ) (897 ) 32 Total deferred tax (benefit) expense (9,773 ) (6,734 ) 557 Income tax (benefit) expense $ (7,565 ) $ 5,392 $ 12,856 The difference between the statutory and the effective federal tax rate for the periods below is attributable to the following: 2020 2019 2018 Statutory income tax rate 21.00 % 21.00 % 28.06 % State taxes (net of federal income tax benefit and valuation allowance) 1.67 % 2.48 % 2.32 % Tax credits 4.49 % (3.39 %) (0.44 %) Revalue of deferred taxes for change in federal tax rate — — (1.23 %) Change in valuation allowance — (0.57 %) — Permanent differences (0.74 %) (2.54 %) (2.41 %) Uncertain tax positions (2.49 %) 3.10 % (1.73 %) Other — 0.08 % (0.09 %) Effective income tax rate 23.93 % 20.16 % 24.48 % F-21 As of June 30, 2020, and 2019 , a summary of the significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities was as follows: 2020 2019 Deferred tax assets: Goodwill and other intangible asset basis difference $ 13,776 $ 2,306 Warranty reserves 4,616 3,848 Accrued selling 850 1,354 Unrecognized tax benefits 566 520 Stock compensation 402 704 Repurchase agreements 261 427 State net operating loss 14 144 Foreign net operating loss 63 79 Credits 65 48 Other 570 — Valuation allowance (65 ) (81 ) Total deferred tax assets 21,118 9,349 Deferred tax liabilities: Depreciation (4,839 ) (3,037 ) Other (199 ) (72 ) Total deferred tax liabilities (5,038 ) (3,109 ) Net deferred tax assets $ 16,080 $ 6,240 On March 27, 2020, President Trump signed into law the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (H.R. 748) (the “CARES Act”). Among the changes to the U.S. federal income tax rules, the CARES Act included a revision to depreciation rules enacted as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. In addition to impacting the current fiscal year, the CARES Act results in the ability to retroactively apply these regulations to certain assets placed in service during the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2019. The Company has evaluated the impacts of the aforementioned provisions and incorporated the necessary changes to tax depreciation methods. We have not identified any material effect on results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Reform Act”), which became effective December 22, 2017, overhauled U.S. corporate income tax law by lowering the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% (blended rate in year one for fiscal year filers), implementing a territorial tax system, imposing a one time “deemed repatriation” tax on all untaxed offshore earnings, and adding/modifying/deleting several major tax deductions significant to the Company. As of June 30, 2020, the Company has state net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards of $0.3 million that expire in varying years ranging from June 30, 2024 to June 30, 2029, and foreign NOL carryforwards of $0.3 million that can be carried forward indefinitely. However, the Company determined that it is more likely than not that the benefit from certain state and foreign NOL carryforwards will not be realized. In recognition of this risk, the Company has provided a partial valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets relating to these state and foreign NOL carryforwards. Unrecognized Tax Benefits A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits, excluding accrued amounts for interest and penalties, is as follows: 2020 2019 Balance at July 1 $ 2,504 $ 1,711 Additions based on tax positions related to the current year 110 889 Additions for tax positions of prior years 713 473 Reductions for tax positions of prior years (164 ) (25 ) Settlements of tax positions from prior years (170 ) (544 ) Balance at June 30 $ 2,993 $ 2,504 F-22 Of this total, $ 2.1 million and $ 1.9 million as of June 30, 2020 and 2019 , respectively , represent the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably affect the effective income tax rate in future periods. The total amount of interest and penalties recorded in the consolidated statements of operations for the years e nded June 30, 2020 , and 2019 was a n expense of $ 0.3 million and $ 0.1 million , respectively. The amounts accrued for interest and penalties at June 30, 2020 and 2019 were $ 0.7 million and $ 0.4 million respectively and is presented in unrecognized tax positi ons on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. In general, it is the practice and intention of the Company to reinvest the earnings of its non-U.S. subsidiaries in those operations. As of June 30, 2020, the Company has not made a provision for U.S. or additional foreign withholding taxes on investments in foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested. Generally, such amounts become subject to U.S. taxation upon the remittance of dividends and under certain other circumstances. The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal income tax, as well as various other state income taxes and foreign income taxes. The Company is no longer subject to examination by taxing authorities for years before June 30, 2017. The Company expects the total amount of unrecognized benefits to increase by approximately $0.2 million in the next twelve months. The Company records unrecognized tax benefits as liabilities and adjusts these liabilities when its judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. Because of the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the unrecognized tax benefit liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which new information is available. 10. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION The 2015 Incentive Award Plan (“2015 Plan”) provides for the grant of stock options, including incentive stock options, and nonqualified stock options (“NSOs”), restricted stock, dividend equivalents, stock payments, restricted stock units, restricted stock awards (“RSAs”), deferred stock, deferred stock units, performance awards, stock appreciation rights, performance stock units (“PSUs”), and cash awards. As of June 30, 2020, there were 1,485,683 shares available for issuance under the 2015 Plan. The following table presents the components of share-based compensation expense by award type for the years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018. 2020 2019 2018 Restricted stock awards $ 1,285 $ 913 $ 616 Performance stock units (233 ) 563 355 Stock options 9 201 215 Share-based compensation expense $ 1,061 $ 1,677 $ 1,186 Adjustment to Share-Based Compensation In conjunction with the resignation of an executive officer in October 2019, approximately $0.5 million of share-based compensation expense recognized in prior periods was reversed during fiscal 2020 for RSAs and PSUs that were forfeited. Additionally, based upon current economic trends, the probability of attaining the performance criteria of the PSUs has been lowered. The amount of compensation cost the Company recognizes over the requisite service period is based on the Company’s best estimate of the achievement of the performance conditions. The amount of compensation expense is adjusted on a cumulative basis; therefore, this adjustment lowered the amount of share-based compensation expense recognized during the year ended June 30, 2020. The following table presents the income tax benefit related to share-based compensation expense recognized by award type. 2020 2019 2018 Restricted stock awards $ 290 $ 217 $ 190 Performance stock units (53 ) 134 110 Stock options 2 48 66 Share-based compensation expense $ 239 $ 399 $ 366 Restricted Stock Awards Beginning in the year ended June 30, 2018, all RSAs granted to non-employee directors vest over the remainder of that fiscal year, and all RSAs granted to employees vest over a period of between one to three years. Generally, non-vested RSAs are forfeited if employment F-23 is terminated prior to vesting. RSAs are granted at a per share fair value equal to the market value of the Company’s common stock on the grant date. The Company recognizes the cost of no n-vested RSAs ratably over the requisite service period. The total grant date fair value of RSAs vested during the years ended June 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018 was $1.0 million , $0.7 million and $0.4 million, respectively. A summary of RSA activity for the years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, is as follows: Number of Restricted Stock Awards Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Total Non-vested Restricted Stock Awards at June 30, 2017 26,417 $ 12.22 Granted 47,651 19.88 Vested (25,870 ) 16.79 Forfeited (4,888 ) 15.89 Total Non-vested Restricted Stock Awards at June 30, 2018 43,310 17.28 Granted 51,995 26.79 Vested (33,093 ) 21.54 Forfeited (8,408 ) 23.08 Total Non-vested Restricted Stock Awards at June 30, 2019 53,804 22.94 Granted 138,457 17.41 Vested (50,570 ) 20.09 Forfeited (34,797 ) 20.24 Total Non-vested Restricted Stock Awards at June 30, 2020 106,894 18.01 As of June 30, 2020, there was $1.2 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested RSAs. The Company expects this expense to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.71 years. Performance Stock Units During the years ended June 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018, the Company granted performance shares to certain employees. The awards will be earned based on the Company’s achievement of certain performance criteria over a three-year performance period. The performance period for the awards commence on July 1 of the fiscal year in which they were granted and continue for a three-year period, ending on June 30 of the applicable year. The probability of achieving the performance criteria is assessed quarterly. Following the determination of the Company’s achievement with respect to the performance criteria, the amount of shares awarded will be subject to adjustment based on the application of a total shareholder return (“TSR”) modifier. The grant date fair value is determined based on both the assessment of the probability of the Company’s achieving the performance criteria and an estimate of the expected TSR modifier. The TSR modifier estimate is determined by using a Monte Carlo Simulation model, which considers the likelihood of all possible outcomes of long-term market performance. The amount of compensation cost the Company recognizes over the requisite service period is based on management’s best estimate of the achievement of the performance criteria. The fair value of PSUs vested during the year ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 was $0.2 million and $0.4 million. No PSUs vested during the years ended June 30, 2018. F-24 A summary of PSU activity for the years ending June 30, 2020 , 2019 and 2018 , is as follows: Number of Performance Stock Units Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Total Non-vested Performance Stock Units at June 30, 2017 40,612 $ 11.85 Granted 26,416 19.62 Forfeited (7,700 ) 14.42 Total Non-vested Performance Stock Units at June 30, 2018 59,328 14.98 Granted 35,122 25.70 Vested (32,373 ) 11.85 Forfeited (11,456 ) 19.73 Total Non-vested Performance Stock Units at June 30, 2019 50,621 23.34 Granted 72,048 18.18 Vested (8,383 ) 19.40 Forfeited (46,882 ) 20.82 Total Non-vested Performance Stock Units at June 30, 2020 67,404 20.02 As of June 30, 2020, there was $0.2 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested PSUs. The Company expects this expense to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.0 years. Nonqualified Stock Options In July 2015, the Company granted 137,786 NSOs to certain employees. As of July 2019, all outstanding options were fully vested and exercisable. The fair value of NSOs vested during each of the years ended June 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018 was $0.2 million. A summary of NSO activity for the years ending June 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018 is as follows: Weighted Weighted Average Average Remaining Aggregate Exercise Contractual Intrinsic Shares Price Term (Yrs.)

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Operating Leases The Company has lease agreements for certain personal and real property. Leases with an initial lease term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. Our lease agreements do not include any significant renewal options. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. Upon adoption of ASC 842 on July 1, 2019, the Company’s most significant lease was for the Crest manufacturing facility, which was classified as an operating lease. This lease included a purchase option for the Company to acquire the premises. During the three months ended September 29, 2019, the decision was made to exercise the purchase option which resulted in $2.8 million of operating lease assets and liabilities being reclassified to finance lease assets and liabilities on the September 29, 2019 condensed consolidated balance sheet. In addition, the decision to exercise the purchase option resulted in the remeasurement of the related lease balances which added $1.3 million of additional finance lease assets and finance lease liabilities to the September 29, 2019 condensed consolidated balance sheet. In accordance with the purchase option, on October 24, 2019 the Company completed the purchase of the Crest manufacturing facility for $4.1 million. Upon completion of this purchase, the Company recognized approximately $4.1 million in Property, plant and equipment, net and derecognized approximately $4.1 million of both Finance lease assets and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. The purchase price of the Crest Facility was determined by appraisal and negotiation between the Company and the seller, whose minority ownership included a member of the Crest management team. The Company funded the purchase by utilizing cash from operations. Total lease cost, including immaterial amounts of variable and short-term lease cost, for the year ended June 30, 2020 was $0.5 million and was primarily recognized in Cost of sales. As of June 30, 2020, the total weighted-average discount rate and remaining lease term for the Company's operating leases were 4.73% and 2.26 years, respectively. For the year ended June 30, 2020, total operating cash flows related to operating leases were $0.5 million. As of June 30, 2020, future payments due under the Company’s operating leases total $0.5 million and are immaterial in each of the next five years. Prior to the adoption of ASC 842, future minimum rental payments under all non-cancelable operating leases with remaining lease terms in excess of one year at June 30, 2019, were as follows: 2020 $ 703 2021 690 2022 628 2023 402 2024 402 Thereafter 1,806 Total $ 4,631 Repurchase Obligations Under certain conditions, the Company is obligated to repurchase new inventory repossessed from dealerships by financial institutions that provide credit to the Company’s dealers. See Note 1 for more information regarding the terms and accounting policies related to this obligation. The maximum obligation of the Company under such floor plan agreements totaled approximately $131.4 million as of June 30, 2020. We incurred no material impact from repurchase events during the years ended June 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018. The Company recorded a repurchase liability of $1.1 million and $1.9 million as of June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Purchase Commitments The Company is engaged in an exclusive contract with a single vendor to provide engines for its MasterCraft performance sport boats. This contract makes this vendor the only supplier to MasterCraft for in-board engines and expires June 30, 2023. The Company is obligated to purchase a minimum number of engines for each model year under this contract. The Company could also be required to pay a penalty to this vendor in order to maintain exclusivity if annual purchases under the agreement fail to meet a certain volume threshold. Legal Proceedings F-26 The Company is involved in certain claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of these matters is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial con dition , results of operations or cash flows . 12. EARNINGS PER SHARE The factors used in the earnings per share computation are as follows: 2020 2019 2018 Net income (loss) $ (24,047 ) $ 21,354 $ 39,653 Weighted average shares — basic 18,734,482 18,653,892 18,619,793 Dilutive effect of assumed exercises of stock options — 45,799 38,835 Dilutive effect of assumed restricted share awards/units — 68,516 55,904 Weighted average outstanding shares — diluted 18,734,482 18,768,207 18,714,531 Basic net income (loss) per share $ (1.28 ) $ 1.14 $ 2.13 Diluted net income (loss) per share $ (1.28 ) $ 1.14 $ 2.12 For the year ended June 30, 2020, the dilutive effect of approximately 45,000 outstanding RSAs, PSUs and NSOs have been excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share as the effect would have been anti-dilutive because of the net loss for the year ended June 30, 2020. For the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, an immaterial number of shares were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share as the effect would have been anti-dilutive. 13. SEGMENT INFORMATION The Company designs, manufactures, and markets recreational performance sport boats, luxury day boats, and outboard boats under three operating and reportable segments: MasterCraft, NauticStar, and Crest. The Company’s segments are defined by the Company’s operational and reporting structures. • The MasterCraft segment produces boats under two product brands, MasterCraft and Aviara, at its Vonore, Tennessee facility. MasterCraft boats are premium recreational performance sport boats primarily used for water skiing, wakeboarding, wake surfing, and general recreational boating. Aviara boats are luxury day boats primarily used for general recreational boating. Production of Aviara boats began during the year ended June 30, 2019 and the Company began selling these boats in July 2019. • The NauticStar segment produces boats at its Amory, Mississippi facility. NauticStar’s boats are primarily used for saltwater fishing and general recreational boating. • The Crest segment produces pontoon boats at its Owosso, Michigan facility. Crest’s boats are primarily used for general recreational boating. Each segment distributes its products through its own dealer network. The Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) regularly reviews the operating performance of each segment including measures of performance based on operating income. Each segment has its own management structure which is responsible for the operations of the segment and which is directly accountable to the CODM. The Company files a consolidated income tax return and does not allocate income taxes and other corporate-level expenses, including interest, to operating segments. All material corporate costs are allocated to the MasterCraft segment.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION Our fiscal year begins on July 1 and ends on June 30 with the interim quarterly reporting periods consisting of thirteen weeks. Therefore, the quarter end will not always coincide with the date of the end of the calendar month. We refer to our fiscal years based on the calendar-year in which they end. Accordingly, references to fiscal 2019, fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 represent our financial results for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2019, June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017, respectively. For ease of reference, we identify our fiscal years in this Form 10-K by reference to the period from July 1 to June 30 of the year in which the fiscal year ends. For example, “fiscal 2019” refers to our fiscal year ended June 30, 2019. MasterCraft Boat Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”), a Delaware corporation, operates primarily through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, MasterCraft Boat Company, LLC, MasterCraft Services, LLC, MasterCraft Parts, Ltd., and MasterCraft International Sales Administration, Inc (collectively “MasterCraft”); Nautic Star, LLC and NS Transport, LLC (collectively “NauticStar”); and Crest Marine, LLC (“Crest”). Unless the context otherwise requires, the Company and its subsidiaries collectively are referred to as the “Company”, “we”, or “us” in this Form 10-K. Effective November 7, 2018, the name of the Company was changed from MCBC Holdings, Inc. to MasterCraft Boat Holdings, Inc. 1 PART I ITEM 1. BUSINESS We are a leading designer, manufacturer, and marketer of recreational powerboats sold under four brands – MasterCraft, NauticStar, Crest, and Aviara. We operate under three operating and reportable segments: MasterCraft, NauticStar, and Crest. The MasterCraft segment includes both our MasterCraft and Aviara brands. Our MasterCraft brand is a world-renowned innovator, designer, manufacturer, and marketer of premium performance sport boats, with a leading market position in the U.S., a strong international presence, and dealers in 46 countries around the world. Our boats are used for water skiing, wakeboarding, wake surfing, as well as general recreational boating. We believe that MasterCraft is the most recognized brand name in the performance sport boat category. In October 2017 we acquired NauticStar, a leading manufacturer and distributor of high-quality outboard bay boats, deck boats and offshore center console boats. NauticStar’s product portfolio provides diversification and expands our direct addressable market into the outboard category, the largest powerboat industry category in terms of retail units, according to the National Marine Manufacturers Association (“NMMA”). In October 2018 we acquired Crest, a leading manufacturer of pontoon boats, providing us with additional product diversification and direct addressable market expansion. With the acquisition of Crest, we expanded our product portfolio and now operate in three of the fastest growing segments of the powerboat industry – performance sport boats, outboard saltwater fishing boats and pontoon boats. In February 2019 we introduced a new brand, Aviara, specifically designed, engineered and manufactured to meet the exacting specifications of consumers seeking the ultimate luxury recreational day boat experience. Partnering with the largest dealership in the U.S., MarineMax, Aviara began shipping and retailing in July 2019. With three anticipated models ranging from 32 – 40 feet in length, using both outboard and sterndrive propulsion, the Aviara brand continues our track record of product diversification and addressable market expansion, both through acquisitions and utilization of our in-house product development capabilities. Aviara will be built in our MasterCraft plant and will be part of the MasterCraft reportable segment. We are committed to delivering an extraordinary boating experience to our customers. From pioneering innovations that improve enjoyment on the water to offering products that promote rapid development of skills, our mission is to help our customers generate memories that will last a lifetime. We utilize a comprehensive product development process in order to build the most relevant and exciting products for our customers, year after year. We believe that our commitment to quality is unsurpassed, and we engage in operational excellence to deploy flexible and effective production systems that ensure we design and build the highest quality boats in the market. All of our boats, from hull to upholstery, are hand-crafted by our skilled workforce at our corporate headquarters near Knoxville, Tennessee, and our facilities in Amory, Mississippi and Owosso, Michigan. In recent years, we have made significant investments in improving design, engineering, manufacturing, and operational processes as we strive to be the most efficient boat manufacturer in the industry. We believe our MasterCraft facility is the only boat manufacturing plant to achieve compliance with all three of the International Standard for Organization (“ISO”) 9001 (Quality Management Systems), 14001 (Environmental Management Systems), and 18001 (International Occupational Health and Safety Management System) standards. MasterCraft’s industry-leading operations result in world-class quality, which enables us to offer, what we believe is a best-in-class five-year factory warranty and results in MasterCraft boats typically maintaining higher aftermarket resale value than our competitors’ boats. We sell our boats through an extensive network of independent dealers in North America and internationally. Our MasterCraft boats are the exclusive performance sport boats offered by the majority of our dealers. Our acquisition of NauticStar and Crest, along with the introduction of our Aviara brand, has allowed us to expand our dealer network over the past two years. We devote significant time and resources to find, develop, and improve the performance of our dealers. We continuously cultivate and strengthen our dealer relationships with marketing, training, and service programs designed to increase our dealers’ sales and profitability. We believe the strength of our dealer network and our proactive efforts to help our dealers improve their businesses give us a distinct competitive advantage in our industry. Our History MasterCraft was founded in 1968 when we built our first custom hull ski boat in a two-stall horse barn on a farm in Maryville, Tennessee. Dissatisfied with the large wakes and pull of other ski boats, we designed a hull that had the smallest wake in the industry: 2 smooth and low at slalom and jump speeds yet well-defined at trick speeds. Our roots in performance water ski boats were reinforced as we evolved over the next 50 years to produce leading pe rformance-oriented boats in the wakeboarding and wake surfing categories. Today, we continue to produce the industry’s premier competitive water ski, wakeboarding, and wake surfing performance boats that also address our customers’ needs for versatility, f lexibility, fun, and functionality. NauticStar, which we acquired in October 2017, was founded in 2002 and is located in Amory, Mississippi. With more than 15 years of boat manufacturing experience—including a 200,000 square-foot manufacturing facility—NauticStar has a reputation for reliability, quality and consistency, with a loyal network of dealers and customers including professional and sport fishermen, and recreational and pleasure boating enthusiasts. Crest, which we acquired in October 2018, was founded in 1957 and is located on approximately 55 acres in Owosso, Michigan. With nearly 150,000 square feet of manufacturing floor space, Crest is one of the top producers of innovative, high-quality pontoon boats ranging from 20 to 29 feet. Aviara is a de novo brand, developed in-house, and focused on serving the luxury recreational day boat segment of the powerboat industry. Introduced at the Miami Boat Show in February 2019, Aviara will initially feature three models utilizing both outboard and sterndrive propulsion. Aviara creates an elevated open water experience by fusing progressive style and effortless comfort in its modern luxury vessels. Our Market Opportunity During 2018, retail sales of new powerboats in the U.S. totaled $10.5 billion. Of the powerboat categories tracked by the NMMA, our MasterCraft brand corresponds most directly to the inboard ski/wakeboard category, which we refer to as the performance sport boat category. The category that most directly corresponds to our NauticStar and Crest brand is the outboard category. Aviara will most directly correspond to the outboard and sterndrive categories. Given our product diversification driven by acquisitions and internal product development, we believe our addressable market also includes similar and adjacent powerboat categories identified by the NMMA, including sterndrive boats, inboard cruiser boats and jet boats. We believe we are well-positioned to benefit from several trends underway in our addressable market, including: • performance sport boats are taking a greater share of the overall fiberglass powerboat category; • outboard boats are taking a greater share of the overall powerboat category; • premium bowriders between 30’ – 40’ in length, both outboard and sterndrive, are taking a greater share of the overall fiberglass powerboat category; • inventory of two to five-year-old pre-owned boats has become limited, driving consumers to purchase new boats; • ease-of-use and performance innovations have accelerated product cycles driving consumer demand for new products; and • higher consumer confidence influenced by improving macroeconomic conditions, including increased home values, greater workforce participation and lower corporate and individual federal income tax rates, has helped to drive increased consumer demand for powerboats. As growth in the general economy and overall boating industry has continued since the economic downturn that commenced in 2008, the performance sport boat and outboard categories have experienced a robust recovery. According to the NMMA, new unit sales of performance sport boats in the U.S. increased at a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 10.7% from 2014 to 2018 while new unit sales of all outboard boats and pontoons grew at a CAGR of 6.2% in the U.S. over the same period. Total new unit sales of powerboats in the U.S. (excluding personal water craft and jet boats) increased at a CAGR of 5.6% from 2014 to 2018. We believe the performance sport boat and outboard boat categories have grown at a faster rate than the rest of the powerboat industry due to increased innovation in the features, designs, and layouts of performance sport boats and outboard propulsion boats. These innovations have improved the performance, functionality, and versatility of these boats as compared with other recreational boats, particularly boats in the sterndrive category, which have not experienced the same degree of innovation. We believe inboard boats are superior to sterndrive boats for tow sports such as water skiing, wakeboarding, and wake surfing for several reasons, including (i) the larger and more propulsive wakes that only inboard engine configurations can enable, (ii) enhanced rider safety as a result of the location of the inboard propeller underneath the boat instead of protruding from the stern, as is generally the case with boats in the sterndrive category, and (iii) relatively more passenger and storage space due to the location of the inboard engine housing. We believe outboard boats are superior to sterndrive boats for recreational boating uses such as fishing and family boating for several reasons, including (i) relatively more passenger and storage space due to the location of the outboard engine housing, (ii) engine noise is significantly reduced in an outboard engine compared to a sterndrive engine, (iii) outboard engines are easier to access and maintain compared to a sterndrive engine, and (iv) outboard engines perform better and have greater durability in saltwater conditions. The expanding popularity of boating has also contributed to the strong recovery in volumes. We believe we are well-positioned to benefit from the increased popularity of recreational boating and the resulting larger prospective customer base. 3 Our Strengths Iconic MasterCraft Brand Synonymous with Quality, Innovation, and Performance. We believe the MasterCraft brand is well-known among boating enthusiasts for high performance, premier quality, and relentless innovation. We believe that the market recognizes MasterCraft as a premier brand in the powerboat industry due to the overall superior value proposition that our boats deliver to our customers. The MasterCraft brand is built on a carefully crafted set of defining principles, including Legacy, Power, Precision and Progression. We work tirelessly every day to maintain our iconic brand reputation relative to our competition. The rigorous attention to detail with which we design and manufacture our products results in high quality boats that command significant resale premiums to comparable competitor boats. Leading Market Share Position in Performance Sport Boat, Outboard, and Pontoon Categories. Over the last decade, we have consistently held a leading market share position in the U.S. among manufacturers of premium performance sport boats based on unit volume. According to the Statistical Surveys, Inc. (“SSI”), our performance sport boat U.S. market share in December 2018 was 21.6%. Per SSI, our U.S. market share for deck boats and saltwater fishing boats in the 15’ – 35’ segment, sold by our NauticStar brand, was 4.5%. Per SSI, Crest’s pontoon boat market share was 3.4%. As of December 2018, based on SSI data, MasterCraft has the #1 market share, by brand, in the performance sport boat segment; NauticStar has the #6 market share, by brand, in the highly-fragmented deck and saltwater fishing segment; and Crest has the #8 market share, by brand, in the highly-fragmented pontoon segment. We believe our sales have grown as dealers and customers continue to recognize the superior quality, performance, styling, and value of our recently released boats and that we are just starting to realize the market share benefits of the many recent new product offerings and product enhancement initiatives that our management team has implemented during the past several years. Industry-Leading Product Design and Innovation. We believe that our innovation in the design of new boat models and new features has been a key to our success, helping us maintain our market share, command higher price points, and generally broaden the appeal of our products among recreational and fishing boaters. As a result of the features we have introduced, we believe that our boats are used for an increasingly wide range of activities. Our commitment to consistently developing new boat models and introducing new features is reflected in several notable recent achievements, including NMMA Innovation Awards for our MasterCraft ProStar water skiing boat, Gen 2 integrated surf system, X24 performance tow boat, and the DockStar Handling System. Our entire MasterCraft product portfolio has been renewed in the past five years, giving us the newest overall product offering in the performance sport boat category. Since acquiring NauticStar, we have introduced four new models, with future plans to introduce several new models over the coming years. At Crest, we are in the beginning stages of designing and engineering new models that we believe will drive innovation in the pontoon segment. Our Aviara brand, designed and engineered completely in-house, features several new innovations that we plan to introduce to the marketplace over the coming years. Highly Efficient Product Development and Manufacturing. We believe that a key to our success has been our renewed focus on operational improvements and world-class business processes. We believe our new product development capabilities are industry-leading and enable us to consistently create unique high-performance hull shapes and product features in shorter design iterations and at lower development costs than our competitors. These capabilities enable us to precisely design custom hulls and performance features that enhance each boat’s unique performance characteristics and increase our speed to market with exciting new products. Our acquisition of NauticStar and Crest allows us to leverage this internal product development and manufacturing expertise to capitalize on operational improvement opportunities at our Amory, Mississippi and Owosso, Michigan facilities. Our Aviara brand will be built in our existing MasterCraft facility, benefiting from the industry-leading quality, safety, and manufacturing process we already have in place there. Strong Dealer Network. We have worked extensively with our dealers to develop what we believe is one of the strongest dealer networks in the performance sport boat, outboard, and pontoon categories. We target our distribution to the market segments’ highest performing dealers. We have established operating processes focused on optimizing dealers’ financial performance and service, and with a track record of balancing wholesale inventory and retail sales we are better able to manage dealer inventory, allowing for more transparent sales estimates and strong dealer relationships. We believe our warranty programs are more transparent than those of our competitors and provide consumers with greater peace of mind. Transparent and thorough warranty programs encourage customers to continue to visit our dealers for servicing, creating additional opportunities for boat trade-ins and purchases of accessories, thereby improving our dealers’ sales rates and financial health. These actions have strengthened our existing dealer network and are driving increased interest from new potential dealers who want to join the MasterCraft, NauticStar and Crest platforms. For our Aviara brand, we have exclusively partnered with MarineMax, the largest marine dealership in the U.S., to market our luxury recreational day boats. We believe introducing a new brand with an established dealer base provides the Aviara brand with instant credibility and the greatest opportunity for long-term success in the marketplace. 4 Differentiated Sales and Marketing Capabilities. We believe our marketing efforts support each of our brand promises by focusing on superior value proposition and differentiating the performance and fe atures of our boats. Our marketing efforts are conducted using an array of strategies, which include digital advertising, social media engagement, advertisements in endemic media and the sponsorship of boating and water sport events. To highlight our Maste rCraft performance credibility and generate additional brand excitement, we sponsor a number of nationally ranked athletes. We believe our superior sales and marketing capabilities effectively communicate our performance, styling, quality, authenticity, an d lifestyle, resulting in increased overall customer engagement. Highly Experienced Executive Team. We have a highly seasoned and effective executive team. With an average of close to 30 years of boating industry experience, our management team has proven its ability to develop and integrate new product lines, enhance operations, strengthen our distribution network, and recruit industry talent. Senior management additions over the past few years have driven improvements to our manufacturing, quality, and product development systems and processes, which have collectively accelerated performance improvements as unit volumes have increased. Our President and Chief Executive Officer, Terry McNew, has 32 years of boating industry experience. He joined MasterCraft in August 2012 after serving as Executive Vice President of Brunswick Corporation’s recreational boat group, where he was in charge of manufacturing, product development, and engineering and quality systems. His leadership has helped us implement dramatic process improvements contributing to superior results. Tim Oxley, our Chief Financial Officer, has spent 29 years in the boating industry, including 13 years with MasterCraft, following 16 years with Brunswick Corporation where he served as Chief Financial Officer of several operating divisions. Jay Povlin, President of NauticStar since March 2019, is a 26-year marine industry veteran and joined MasterCraft in 2013. He brings considerable marine executive business leadership experience from both domestic and international markets. During his many years in the marine industry, he has also held numerous senior leadership positions with Brunswick Corporation and in those roles provided strategic direction for business unit performance, manufacturing operations, sales and marketing efforts, and product development initiatives. Patrick May, President of Crest, oversees sales, marketing, product development and manufacturing activities. Before its acquisition by MasterCraft, he served as COO and CFO of Crest since April 2010. Our Strategy Continue to Develop New and Innovative Products. As a leading innovator, designer, manufacturer, and marketer of premium performance sport boats, and high-quality bay, deck and center console outboard boats, we strive to design new and inventive products that appeal to a broad customer base. Since fiscal 2013, we have successfully launched a number of new products and features with best-in-class quality leading to increased sales and significant margin expansion. Furthermore, our unique new product development process enables us to renew our product portfolio with innovative offerings at a rate that we believe will be difficult for our competitors to match without significant additional capital investments. Our process involves each department in collaborative full “team” product launches that enable us to release several new models per year, per brand, while maintaining superior quality and controlling costs. Our entire MasterCraft product portfolio has been renewed in the past five years, and we have released four new models at NauticStar since our acquisition in October 2017. We intend to bring this product development process and discipline to Crest, and any future brands we may acquire, by continuing to release new products and features multiple times during the year, which we believe will further enhance our reputation as a cutting-edge boat manufacturer and consumer interest in our products. Capture Additional Share from Adjacent Boating Categories. Our NauticStar, Crest, and Aviara brands provide us with direct access to the outboard and sterndrive categories, with outboards representing the largest category of the powerboat industry with $7.0 billion of sales in 2018, per the NMMA, and provides diversification from our existing MasterCraft product portfolio. The additions of NauticStar, Crest, and Aviara, combined with our culture of innovation, enhances our ability to introduce new products with increased versatility, functionality, and performance to a more expansive customer base that values boats for competitive and recreational fishing, and general recreational boating purposes. Ultimately, the versatile boating experience delivered by our MasterCraft, NauticStar, Crest, and Aviara boats allows us to attract customers from other boating categories, most notably from the sterndrive categories. We intend to further enhance the performance, comfort, and versatility of our products to target additional customers seeking high performance water sport, fishing and general recreational activity. Continuous Operational Improvement to Drive Margin Expansion. We continue to implement a number of initiatives to reduce our cost base and to improve the efficiency of our manufacturing process. These process improvements have lowered re-work, warranty claims, material waste, and inventory levels, reducing our costs, and have driven improved on-time delivery rates. Since acquiring NauticStar and Crest, we have worked to revamp each of their respective manufacturing and product development processes, which should lead to operational efficiencies and drive margin expansion going forward. Additionally, we have fostered a culture of operational improvement within our highly engaged workforce, at MasterCraft, NauticStar and Crest. These processes are now ingrained in our culture, leading to a Company-wide focus on driving further margin expansion through continuous improvement. We believe these important process improvements and culture of operational excellence provide us with a strong operational foundation and margin improvement opportunities in the future. 5 Effecti vely Manage Dealer Inventory and Further Strengthen Our Dealer Network. Our goal is to achieve and maintain a leading market share in each of the markets in which we operate. We view our dealers as our partners and product champions. Therefore, we devote significant time and resources to finding high quality dealers and developing and improving their performance over time. We actively manage field inventory levels, as demonstrated by healthy and consistent inventory retail turns and balanced wholesale and retail unit sales, which leads to better margins and improved financial health for our dealers. Additionally, our warranty programs for our products and predictable new product development cycles across our portfolio ensure that our dealers have high quali ty, compelling, and relevant products to sell to their customers. We believe the quality and trust in our dealer relationships are more beneficial to our long-term success than the quantity of dealers. We continue to leverage that dealer base while proacti vely developing strategies that will strengthen our overall network. For example, we intend to strengthen our current footprint by selectively recruiting market-leading dealers. We believe our targeted initiatives to enhance and grow our dealer network wil l increase unit sales in the future. Increase Our Sales in International Markets. We currently have an extensive international distribution network with 45 international dealers in 76 locations around the world. We believe MasterCraft is the most well-known brand in the performance sport boat category globally, and that NauticStar, Crest, and Aviara have the potential for global growth. Based on our brand recognition, innovative product offerings, and distribution strengths, we believe we are well positioned to leverage our reputation and capture additional international sales. We believe that we will increase our international sales by promoting our new products in developed markets where we have a well-established dealer base and in international markets where rising consumer incomes are expected to increase demand for recreational products, such as Australia, Europe, Israel, Dubai, and Brazil. We are also developing new product offerings that will specifically target certain product demand from our international consumers and that we believe will drive further sales growth in international markets. Net sales outside of North America represented 5.2% of net sales in fiscal 2019. Our Products We design, manufacture, and sell premium recreational performance sport boats, outboard, and sterndrive boats that we believe deliver superior performance for water skiing, wakeboarding, wake surfing, and fishing, as well as general recreational boating. In addition, we offer various accessories, including trailers and aftermarket parts. We market our boats under four brands: MasterCraft, NauticStar, Crest, and Aviara. Our MasterCraft portfolio of Star Series, XSeries, XTSeries and NXT boats are designed for the highest levels of performance, styling, and enjoyment for both recreational and competitive use. The Star Series and XSeries are geared towards the consumer seeking the most premium and highest performance boating experience that we offer, and generally command a price premium over our competitors’ boats at retail prices ranging from approximately $62,000 to $220,000. The MasterCraft XT line was introduced in July 2016 as a multi-sport, category-defying crossover, with retail prices ranging from approximately $80,000 to $135,000. Unveiled in January 2014, the MasterCraft NXT line introduced the quality, performance, styling, and innovation of the MasterCraft brand to the entry-level consumer, with retail prices ranging from approximately $62,000 to $90,000. We have strategically designed and priced the MasterCraft NXT line to target the fast-growing entry-level customer group that is distinct from our traditional customer base, while maintaining our core MasterCraft brand attributes at profit margins comparable to our other offerings. Our NauticStar portfolio of Nautic Bay Boats, Sport Deck Boats, Offshore Boats and Legacy Series boats are designed for a variety of uses, including recreational and competitive sport fishing in freshwater lakes or saltwater, and general recreational enjoyment. The Nautic Bay Boats and Offshore Boats are geared towards the consumer seeking unmatched quality and features for fishability and family friendly comfort. The Sport Deck Boat line caters to consumers seeking the drive and ride of a V-hull, large capacity, and the styling and efficiency of a runabout. The Legacy Series line is geared towards the consumer seeking the most premium and highest performance boating experience that NauticStar offers. NauticStar’s retail prices range from approximately $25,000 to $195,000. Our Crest portfolio of pontoon boats are designed for the ultimate in comfort and recreational pleasure boating. Crest’s pontoon boats are designed to offer consumers the best in luxury, style and performance without compromise across a diverse product portfolio. Crest’s retail prices range from approximately $25,000 to $190,000. Our Aviara portfolio of luxury recreational day boats was designed in-house with the vision to create pleasure crafts that defy compromise. The Aviara brand drew on MasterCraft’s 50-year legacy of quality and will be built in our award-winning MasterCraft facility. Aviara’s boat designs were inspired by our four product design principles – Progressive Style, Elevated Control, Modern Comfort and Quality Details. Aviara’s first model, the AV32, is a 32-foot luxury bowrider and is expected to have a retail price of approximately $300,000. Future models to be introduced over the next year include the AV36, a 36-foot luxury bowrider, and the AV40, the brand’s flagship 40-foot luxury bowrider for the ultimate on-the-water experience. All models will be available in either outboard or sterndrive propulsion, and will be exclusively sold at MarineMax dealerships across the U.S. 6 Our Dealer Network We rely on an extensive network of independent dealers to sell our products in North America and internationally. For MasterCraft, NauticStar, Crest, and Aviara, we target our distribution to the market segment’s highest performing dealers. The majority of our MasterCraft dealers are exclusive to our MasterCraft product lines within the performance sport boat category, highlighting the commitment of our key dealers to MasterCraft boats. We establish performance criteria that our dealers must meet as part of their dealer agreements to ensure the continued quality of our dealer network. As members of our network, dealers in North America may qualify for floor plan financing programs, rebates, seasonal discounts, promotional co-op payments, and other allowances. We consistently review our distribution network to identify opportunities to expand our geographic footprint and improve our coverage of the market. We constantly monitor the health and strength of our dealers by analyzing each dealer’s retail sales and inventory frequently and have established processes to identify underperforming dealers in order to assist them in improving their performance or to allow us to switch to a more effective dealer. These processes also allow us to better manage dealer inventory levels and product turns and contribute to a healthier dealer network that is better able to stock and sell our products. We believe our outstanding dealer network and our proactive approach to dealer management allow us to distribute our products more efficiently than our competitors and will help us capitalize on growth opportunities as our industry volumes continue to increase. For fiscal 2019 the Company’s top ten dealers accounted for approximately 25% of our net sales and none of our dealers accounted for more than 3% of our total sales volume. North America. In North America, our MasterCraft brand, had a total of 112 dealers across 147 locations as of June 30, 2019. Our NauticStar brand had a total of 76 dealers across 99 locations in North America as of June 30, 2019. Our Crest brand had a total of 112 dealers across 125 locations in North America as of June 30, 2019. We do not have a significant concentration of sales among our dealers. Outside of North America. As of June 30, 2019, through our MasterCraft brand, we had a total of 45 international dealers in 76 locations and through our NauticStar brand we had one international dealer with a single location. We are present in Europe, Australia, Africa, Asia, including Hong Kong and the Middle East. We generated 4.2%, 6.6% and 9.1% of our unit sales outside of North America in fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. Dealer Management We have developed a system of financial incentives for our dealers based on achievement of key benchmarks. In addition, we provide our dealers with comprehensive sales training and a complete set of technology-based tools designed to help dealers maximize performance. Our dealer incentive program has been refined through years of experience with some of the key elements including performance incentives, discounts paid for achieving volume and purchase scheduling targets, and cash discounts to encourage balanced demand throughout the year. In addition, at MasterCraft, we pay incentives for attending our annual dealer meeting, an event featuring a robust program of dealer training seminars that focus on areas such as sales growth, inventory management, and retail strategy, in addition to product-oriented information. This incentive payment is based on participation by all salespeople from a dealership, not solely the principals. Beyond our incentive programs, we have developed a proprietary web-based management tool that is used by our dealers on a day-to-day basis to improve their own businesses as well as enhance communication with our factory and sales management teams. Our proprietary DealerLink online business-to-business application efficiently executes many critical functions, including warranty registrations, warranty claims, boat ordering and tracking, parts ordering, technical support, and inventory reporting. This system facilitates communication between our sales team and the dealer network and allows our manufacturing department to review customer demand in real time. Sales Cycles and Floor Plan Financing We manage our annual sales plan through distinct buying periods. Our rebates are tiered so that dealers have a financial incentive to take the stocking risk for boats purchased prior to the traditional retail selling season (April - June). These incentives, accompanied by floor plan subsidies for up to nine months from the date of invoice, drive “level loading” of production. During this first part of the model year, many of the dealers’ orders are standard configurations for their showrooms. In the second part of the model year, more boats are customized by retail customers. Many of these custom orders are placed during boat shows, which occur from January through early April across North America. 7 We offer our dealers the opportunity to purchase boats with cash or through floor plan financing programs wit h third-party floor plan financing providers. We incentivize our dealers to purchase in cash by offering them a cash discount. The floor plan financing programs allow dealers to establish lines of credit with third-party lenders to purchase inventory. Upon purchase of a boat, dealers draw on the floor plan facility and the lenders pay the invoice price of the boat directly to us typically within 5 business days. Consistent with industry practice, we offer various manufacturer-sponsored floor plan interest p rograms under which we agree to reimburse our dealers for certain floor plan interest costs incurred for up to nine months from the date of invoice. In some cases, cash discounts are offered as an alternative to floor plan subsidies. These programs encoura ge dealers to rapidly replenish inventories during the spring and summer retail season, maintain sufficient inventories during the non-peak season, and balance wholesale purchases throughout the year. Pursuant to the terms of the floor plan financing, if a dealer defaults on the terms of its credit line, we agree to repurchase new inventory repossessed from dealerships. Our obligation to repurchase such repossessed products for the unpaid balance of our original invoice price for the boat is subject to reduction or limitation based on the age and condition of the boat at the time of repurchase, and in certain cases, by an aggregate cap on repurchase obligations associated with a particular floor plan financing program. We incurred no material impact from repurchase events during fiscal 2019, 2018, or 2017. Marketing and Sales Marketing We believe that our differentiated marketing capabilities and our multi-channel, content-driven marketing strategies align with our strategic focus on product innovation, performance, and quality to attract aspiring and enthusiast consumers to our brands and products. These sales and marketing efforts allow us to more effectively launch and support our products, help drive actionable sales leads for our dealers, and reinforce our MasterCraft, NauticStar, Crest, and Aviara brand and lifestyle attributes. Our over 50-year history of manufacturing and design leadership has made MasterCraft one of the most well-known and iconic brands in the boating industry. We believe the MasterCraft brand is widely recognized even among non-enthusiasts. Our NauticStar and Crest brands are relatively young compared to MasterCraft but have quickly established themselves as strong brands dedicated to innovation, style and quality. We are focused on enhancing the power of our brands through a multifaceted marketing strategy. Our addressable market is targeted through a variety of specialized means, ranging from event sponsorships to far-reaching strategic alliances. We have created a unified print and digital advertising strategy that is refreshed each year, featuring the unique attributes of each of our products while maintaining focus on the MasterCraft, NauticStar, Crest, and Aviara brands. We maintain a meaningful presence for our product lines in several endemic water sports and boating publications. Given the prevalence of our products in the markets these publications target, we also benefit from significant unpaid impressions in these industry publications, as our boats frequently appear in feature stories and advertisements for other products. In addition to these traditional marketing channels, in the last several years we have created an active and highly successful digital advertising and social media platform, including the use of Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, and Vimeo to deliver content to our target audience, increase awareness of our brands, foster loyalty, and build a community of MasterCraft, NauticStar and Crest enthusiasts. In addition, we benefit from numerous user-generated videos and photos that are uploaded to these websites. An important component of this strategy has been our investment in our own mastercraft.com, nauticstarboats.com, crestpontoonboats.com, and aviaraboats.com websites. The sites are designed to allow significant interaction between us and our customer base through marketing content delivery, message boards, news and event postings, and product updates and specifications. Our popular “Design-a-Boat” functionality allows consumers to design a boat and request a dealer quote. The custom-designed product can be transmitted directly to our closest independent dealer as well as our in-house concierge who follows up directly with our dealer leads for MasterCraft and Aviara. Our leading position in the performance sport boat category is further supported by our sponsorship of some of the most recognizable and successful athletes in water sports, as well as a number of highly visible competitions and events around the world. Our activities in this area serve to deepen the penetration of our brands within the professional and enthusiast community, while also supporting the growth of the sports. The events which we sponsor and in which we and our dealers participate feature the most popular figures in wakeboarding and water skiing, drawing large audiences of enthusiasts to a variety of sites around the country. Furthermore, we sponsor top ranked professional wakeboarding athletes, water ski jumpers, and water skiers. In addition to the advertising generated by the athletes’ success in their sports, we also leverage our sponsorship of these athletes by having them attend boat shows and dealer events and appear in creative media events, in which they garner public relations interest, build our MasterCraft brand, and in many cases help sell our products directly to consumers. 8 Sales Our sales organization’s primary role is to manage our network of existing dealers and work with them to increase sales of our products, as well as identifying and recruiting new and replacement dealers that we believe will provide enhanced sales and customer service for our end consumers. We employ proactive processes to monitor the health and performance of our dealers, and to help them improve their businesses and their sales of our products. Our strategy is to improve the individual market shares of each of our dealers in their respective markets, and to add new dealers in new markets or replace dealers in existing markets where we believe we can achieve improved market share and customer service. We utilize regular performance reviews to drive improvement in underperforming dealers and to determine how to transition to new dealers when necessary. In addition, we employ a number of tools to assist our dealers in improving their performance, including product, sales, and service training, marketing materials and content, and direct interaction with prospective customers such as our factory concierge service. We encourage and expect our sales representatives to serve as advisors to our dealers, and believe this proactive sales approach leads to better dealer relationships and higher sales of our products. Manufacturing All of our MasterCraft and Aviara boats are designed, manufactured, and lake-tested in our Vonore, Tennessee facility. All of our NauticStar boats are designed and manufactured in our Amory, Mississippi facility. All of our Crest boats are designed and manufactured in our Owosso, Michigan facility. We believe MasterCraft is the only boat manufacturing facility to achieve compliance with all three of the ISO 9001 (Quality Management Systems), 14001 (Environmental Management Systems), and 18001 (International Occupational Health and Safety Management System) standards. The rigorous attention to detail with which we design and manufacture our MasterCraft products results in boats of high quality, which allows us to offer a “stem-to-stern” five-year warranty that comprehensively covers more parts of our boats than warranties offered by any of our competitors. In recognition of our operational excellence, MasterCraft was named a 2015 IndustryWeek Best Plant in North America Recipient—the only boat manufacturer ever to receive that honor. Our boats are built through a continuous flow manufacturing process that encompasses fabrication, assembly, quality management, and testing. We manufacture certain components and subassemblies for our boats, such as upholstery, and procure other components from third-party vendors and install them on the boat. We have several exclusive supplier partnerships for critical purchased components, such as aluminum billet, towers, and engine packages. For MasterCraft, we also build custom trailers that match the exact size and color of our boats. Research and Development, Product Development and Engineering We are strategically and financially committed to innovation, as reflected in our dedicated product development and engineering groups and evidenced by our track record of new product introduction. At MasterCraft and Aviara, our product development and engineering group comprises 24 professionals. At NauticStar, our product development and engineering group comprises seven professionals. At Crest, our product development and engineering group comprises five professionals. These individuals bring to our product development efforts significant expertise across core disciplines, including boat design, computer-aided design, naval engineering, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering. They are responsible for execution of all facets of our new product strategy, starting with design and development of new boat models and innovative features, engineering these designs for manufacturing, and integrating new boats and innovations into production without disruption, at high quality, on time and on budget. Our product development and engineering functions work closely with our Strategic Portfolio Management Team which includes senior leadership from Sales, Marketing and Finance, all working together to develop our long-term product and innovation strategies. We take a disciplined approach to the management of our product development strategy. We have structured processes to obtain voices of the customer, dealer, and management to guide our long-term product lifecycle and portfolio planning. In addition, extensive testing and coordination with our manufacturing group are important elements of our product development process, which we believe enable us to leverage the lessons from past launches and minimize the risk associated with the release of new products. We have developed a strategy to launch several new models a year, which will allow us to renew our product portfolio with innovative offerings at a rate that we believe will be difficult for our competitors to match without significant additional capital investments. In addition to our new product strategy, we manage a separate innovation development process which allows us to design innovative new features for our boats in a disciplined manner and to launch these innovations in a more rapid time frame and with higher quality. These enhanced processes have reduced the time to market for our new product pipeline. Our research and product development expense for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $5.6 million, $4.9 million, and $3.6 million, respectively. 9 Suppliers We purchase a wide variety of raw materials from our supplier base, including resins, fiberglass, hydrocarbon feedstocks, and steel, as well as product parts and components such as engines and electronic controls. We maintain long-term contracts with preferred suppliers and informal arrangements with other suppliers. We have not experienced any material shortages in any of our raw materials, product parts, or components. Temporary shortages, when they do occur, usually involve manufacturers of these products adjusting model mix, introducing new product lines, or limiting production in response to an industry-wide reduction in boat demand. We are focused on developing our supply chain to enable cost improvement, world-class quality, and continuous product innovation. We have engaged our top suppliers in collaborative preferred supplier relationships and have developed processes including annual cost reduction targets, regular reliability projects, and extensive product testing requirements to ensure that our suppliers produce at low cost and to the highest levels of quality expected of our brands. These collaborative efforts begin at the design stage, with our key suppliers integrated into design and development planning well in advance of launch, which allows us to control costs and to leverage the expertise of our suppliers in developing product innovations. We believe these collaborative relationships with our most important suppliers have contributed to our significant improvements in product quality, innovation, and profitability. The most significant components used in manufacturing our boats, based on cost, are engine packages. For our MasterCraft brand, Ilmor Engineering, Inc. (“Ilmor”) is MasterCraft’s exclusive engine supplier, and for our NauticStar brand, Yamaha Motor Corporation (“Yamaha”) is our largest engine supplier, while Mercury Marine (“Mercury”) is Crest’s largest engine supplier. Mercury also provides outboard engines available on our Aviara brand. We maintain strong and long-standing relationships with Ilmor, Yamaha, and Mercury. As of June 30, 2019, Ilmor is our largest overall supplier. In addition to performance sport boat engines, Ilmor’s affiliates produce engines used in a number of leading racing boats and race cars. Ilmor maintains a full-time customer service and warranty staff located at our MasterCraft office, resulting in extremely efficient management of all engine-related matters, mitigating potential warranty risk. We work closely with Ilmor to remain at the forefront of engine design, performance, and manufacturing. Engine packages are the most expensive single item input in the MasterCraft and Aviara boat-building process and we believe our long-term relationship with Ilmor is a key competitive advantage. Transportation We utilize third party logistics and transportation services along with a fleet of leased tractor trailers at NauticStar, to deliver our boats to our dealer network. A select few dealers near our manufacturing facilities have elected to manage transportation and arrange for boats to be picked up directly from our manufacturing facilities. Following delivery to port, international shipments are transferred to a third-party logistics provider who schedules them for shipment via ocean freight to their destination country. Information Technology Over the last several years, we have made a significant investment in information technology. Our information technology strategy is to fully integrate IT into our business processes and planning initiatives, including not only our internal information management and communications processes but also our marketing and dealer management efforts. Our IT team has been integral to our marketing efforts through website functionality such as the “Build-a-Boat” and “Factory Tour” features, helping us to develop stronger engagement between us and our end consumers. In addition, our IT infrastructure is an essential component of our dealer management initiatives, allowing for efficient and timely communications with our dealers and a transparent and effective system for dealer orders and production planning. We will continue to invest in our IT infrastructure in order to continue to leverage technology in support of our product development, manufacturing, and marketing strategies. Insurance and Product Warranties We purchase insurance to cover standard risks in our industry, including policies that cover general product liability, workers’ compensation, auto liability, and other casualty and property risks. Our insurance rates are based on our safety record as well as trends in the insurance industry. We also maintain workers’ compensation insurance and auto insurance policies that are retrospective in that the cost per year will vary depending on the frequency and severity of claims in the policy year. We face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that, among other things, the use of our products results in injury. With respect to product liability coverage, we carry customary insurance coverage. Our coverage involves self-insured retentions with primary and excess liability coverage above the retention amount. We have the ability to refer claims to our suppliers and their insurers to pay the costs associated with any claims arising from such suppliers’ products. Our insurance covers such claims that are not adequately covered by a supplier’s insurance and provides for excess secondary coverage above the limits provided by our suppliers. We provide product warranties for all of our boat models. During the warranty period, we reimburse dealers and authorized service facilities for all or a portion of the cost of repair or replacement performed on the products. Some materials, components or parts of the boat that are not covered by our product warranties are separately warranted by their manufacturers or suppliers. These other warranties include warranties covering engines, among other components. 10 Intellectual Propert y We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, and copyright protection, trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, and contractual provisions to protect our rights in our brands, products, and proprietary technology. We also protect our vessel hull designs through vessel hull design registrations. This is an important part of our business and we intend to continue protecting our intellectual property. We currently hold 27 U.S. patents and five foreign patents, including utility and design patents for our transom surf seating, our DockStar handling system, and our Gen 2 surf system technology. Provided that we comply with all statutory maintenance requirements, our patents are expected to expire between 2021 and 2037. We also have 14 pending U.S. patent applications and four pending foreign patent applications. We also own in excess of 95 trademark registrations in various countries around the world, most notably for the MasterCraft, NauticStar, and Aviara names and logos, as well as numerous model names in MasterCraft’s Star Series, X Series, XT Series, and NXT Series product families, and we have over 15 pending applications for additional registrations. Such trademarks may endure in perpetuity on a country-by-country basis provided that we comply with all statutory maintenance requirements, including continued use of each trademark in each such country. In addition, we own 38 registered U.S. copyrights. Finally, we have registered more than 30 vessel hull designs with the U.S. Copyright Office, the most recent of which will remain in force through 2027. From time to time, we are involved in intellectual property litigation, either accusing third parties of infringing our intellectual property rights, or defending against third-party claims that we are infringing the intellectual property of others. We are not currently involved in any outstanding intellectual property litigation that we believe, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. However, we cannot predict the outcome of any pending or future litigation, and an unfavorable outcome could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Competition The powerboat industry, including the performance sport boat, outboard, and pontoon categories, are highly fragmented, resulting in intense competition for customers and dealers. Competition affects our ability to succeed in both the market segments we currently serve and new market segments that we may enter in the future. We compete with several large manufacturers that may have greater financial, marketing, and other resources than we do. We also compete with a wide variety of small privately held independent manufacturers. Competition in our industry is based primarily on brand name, price, innovative features, design, and product performance. Please see Item 1A, “Risk Factors” — Risks Related to Our Business — Our industry is characterized by intense competition, which affects our sales and profits. Seasonality Our operating results are subject to annual and seasonal fluctuations resulting from a variety of factors, including: • seasonal variations in retail demand for boats, with a significant majority of sales occurring during peak boating season, which we attempt to manage by providing incentive programs and floor plan subsidies to encourage dealer purchases throughout the year, which may include offering off-season retail promotions to our dealers in seasonally slow months, during and ahead of boat shows, to encourage retail demand; • product mix, which is driven by boat model mix and higher option order rates; while sales of all our boats generate comparable margins, sales of larger boats and boats with optional content produce higher absolute profits; • inclement weather, which can affect production at our manufacturing facilities as well as consumer demand; • competition from other recreational boat manufacturers; • general economic conditions. Environmental, Safety, and Regulatory Matters Our operations are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations, including those concerning product safety, environmental protection, and occupational health and safety. We believe that our operations and products are in compliance with these regulatory requirements. Historically, the cost of achieving and maintaining compliance with applicable laws and regulations has not been material. However, we cannot provide assurance that future costs and expenses required for us to comply with such laws and regulations, including any new or modified regulatory requirements, or to address newly discovered environmental conditions, will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, or cash flows. We have not been notified of and are otherwise currently not aware of any contamination at our current or former facilities for which we could be liable under environmental laws or regulations and we currently are not undertaking any remediation or investigation activities in connection with any contamination. However, future spills or accidents or the discovery of currently unknown conditions or non-compliances may give rise to investigation and remediation obligations or related liabilities and damage claims, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, or cash flows. The regulatory programs that impact our business include the following: 11 Hazardous Substance an d Waste Regulations Certain materials used in our manufacturing, including the resins used in production of our boats, are toxic, flammable, corrosive, or reactive and are classified by the federal and state governments as “hazardous materials.” Control of these substances is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and state pollution control agencies under the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and related state programs. Storage of these materials must be maintained in appropriately labeled and monitored containers, and disposal of wastes requires completion of detailed waste manifests and recordkeeping requirements. Any failure by us to properly store or dispose of our hazardous materials could result in liability, including fines, penalties, or obligations to investigate and remediate any contamination originating from our operations. OSHA The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Act imposes standards of conduct for and regulates workplace safety, including limits on the amount of emissions to which an employee may be exposed without the need for respiratory protection or upgraded plant ventilation. Our facilities are regularly inspected by OSHA and by state and local inspection agencies and departments. We believe that our facilities comply in all material aspects with these regulations. We have made a considerable investment in safety awareness programs and provide ongoing safety training for all of our employees. We have implemented a program that requires frequent safety inspections of our facilities by managers and an internal safety committee. The safety committee, which is led by a dedicated health and safety professional, prepares a monthly action plan based on its findings. Clean Air Act The Clean Air Act (the “CAA”) and corresponding state rules regulate emissions of air pollutants. Because our manufacturing operations involve molding and coating of fiberglass materials, which involves the emission of certain volatile organic compounds, hazardous air pollutants, and particulate matter, we are required to maintain and comply with a CAA operating permit (or “Title V” permit). Our Title V Permit requires us to monitor our emissions and periodically certify that our emissions are within specified limits. To date, we have not had material difficulty complying with those limits. In addition to the regulation of our manufacturing operations, the EPA has adopted regulations stipulating that many marine propulsion engines meet an air emission standard that requires fitting a catalytic converter to the engine. The engines used in our products, all of which are manufactured by third parties, are warranted by the manufacturers to be in compliance with the EPA’s emission standards. The additional cost of complying with these regulations has increased our cost to purchase the engines and, accordingly, has increased the cost to manufacture our products. If we are not able to pass these additional costs along to our customers, it may have a negative impact on our business and financial condition. Boat Safety Standards Powerboats sold in the U.S. must be manufactured to meet the standards of certification required by the U.S. Coast Guard. In addition, boats manufactured for sale in the European Union must be certified to meet the European Union’s imported manufactured products standards. These certifications specify standards for the design and construction of powerboats. We believe that all our boats meet these standards. In addition, safety of recreational boats is subject to federal regulation under the Boat Safety Act of 1971, which requires boat manufacturers to recall products for replacement of parts or components that have demonstrated defects affecting safety. In the past, we have instituted recalls for defective component parts produced by us or certain of our third-party suppliers. None of these recalls has had a material adverse effect on the Company. Employees We believe we maintain excellent relations with our employees, treating them as business partners and focusing on building their careers. We have approximately 1,195 employees as of June 30, 2019, 605 of whom work at our MasterCraft/Aviara facility in Tennessee, 307 of whom work at our NauticStar facility in Mississippi, and 283 of whom work at our Crest facility in Michigan. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and since MasterCraft’s founding in 1968, we have never experienced a labor-related work stoppage. Other Information We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware under the name MCBC Holdings, Inc. on January 28, 2000. In July 2015, we completed an initial public offering of our common stock. Effective November 7, 2018, the name of the Company was changed from 12 MCBC Holdings, Inc. to MasterCraft Boat Holdings, Inc. We maintain a website with the address www.mastercraft.com. We are not including the information contained in our website as part of, or incorporating it by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We make available, free of charge through our website, our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to these reports as soon as reasonably p racticable after we electronically file these materials with, or otherwise furnish them to, the SEC. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. RISK FACTORS Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as other information in this Form 10-K, before deciding whether to invest in shares of our common stock. The occurrence of any of the events described below could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects. In such an event, the trading price of our common stock may decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. Risks Related to Our Business General economic conditions, particularly in the U.S., affect our industry, demand for our products and our business, and results of operations. Demand for premium sport boat, outboard boat brands and pontoon boats can be, and in the past have been, significantly influenced by weak economic conditions, low consumer confidence, high unemployment, and increased market volatility worldwide, especially in the U.S. In times of economic uncertainty and contraction, consumers tend to have less discretionary income and tend to defer or avoid expenditures for discretionary items, such as our products. Sales of our products are highly sensitive to personal discretionary spending levels. Our business is cyclical in nature and its success is impacted by economic conditions, the overall level of consumer confidence and discretionary income levels. Any substantial deterioration in general economic conditions that diminishes consumer confidence or discretionary income may reduce our sales and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Corporate restructurings, layoffs, declines in the value of investments and residential real estate, higher fuel and energy prices, higher interest rates, and increases in federal and state taxation may also each materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Consumers often finance purchases of our products, and as a result, consumer credit market conditions influence demand for our boats. If credit conditions worsen, and adversely affect the ability of consumers to finance potential purchases at acceptable terms and interest rates, it could result in a decrease in the sales of our products. Our annual and quarterly financial results are subject to significant fluctuations depending on various factors, many of which are beyond our control. Our sales and operating results can vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year depending on various factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to: • seasonal consumer demand for our products; • discretionary spending habits; • changes in pricing in, or the availability of supply in, the used powerboat market; • failure to maintain a premium brand image; • disruption in the operation of our manufacturing facilities; • variations in the timing and volume of our sales; • the timing of our expenditures in anticipation of future sales; • sales promotions by us and our competitors; • changes in competitive and economic conditions generally; 13 • consumer preferences and competition for consumers’ leisure time; • impact of unfavorable weather conditions; • changes in trade policy or the imposition of additional tariffs; • changes in the cost or availability of our labor; and • increased fuel prices. Due to these and other factors, our results of operations may decline quickly and significantly in response to changes in order patterns or rapid decreases in demand for our products. We anticipate that fluctuations in operating results will continue in the future. Unfavorable weather conditions may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, especially during the peak boating season. Adverse weather conditions in any year in any particular geographic region may adversely affect sales in that region, especially during the peak boating season. Sales of our products are generally stronger just before and during spring and summer, which represent the peak boating months in most of our markets, and favorable weather during these months generally has a positive effect on consumer demand. Conversely, unseasonably cool weather, excessive rainfall, reduced rainfall levels, or drought conditions during these periods may close area boating locations or render boating dangerous or inconvenient, thereby generally reducing consumer demand for our products. Our annual results would be materially and adversely affected if our net sales were to fall below expected seasonal levels during these periods. We may also experience more pronounced seasonal fluctuation in net sales in the future as we continue to expand our businesses. Additionally, to the extent that unfavorable weather conditions are exacerbated by global climate change or otherwise, our sales may be affected to a greater degree than we have previously experienced. There can be no assurance that weather conditions will not have a material effect on the sales of any of our products. We depend on our network of independent dealers, face increasing competition for dealers, and have little control over their activities. Substantially all of our sales are derived from our network of independent dealers. Our agreements with dealers in our networks typically provide for one-year terms, although some agreements have a term of up to three years. For fiscal 2019, our top ten dealers accounted for 25% of our total net sales. The loss of one or more of these dealers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The number of dealers supporting our products and the quality of their marketing and servicing efforts are essential to our ability to generate sales. Competition for dealers among performance sport boat manufacturers continues to increase based on the quality, price, value, and availability of the manufacturers’ products, the manufacturers’ attention to customer service, and the marketing support that the manufacturer provides to the dealers. We face intense competition from other premium performance sport, outboard boat, and pontoon boat manufacturers in attracting and retaining dealers (some of whom also sell products from other premium performance sport and outboard boat manufacturers), affecting our ability to attract or retain relationships with qualified and successful dealers. Although our management believes that the quality of our products in the premium performance sport, outboard boat, and pontoon boat industries should permit us to maintain our relationships with our dealers and our market share position, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or improve our relationships with our dealers or our market share position. In addition, independent dealers in the powerboat industry have experienced significant consolidation in recent years, which could result in the loss of one or more of our dealers in the future if the surviving entity in any such consolidation purchases similar products from a competitor. A substantial deterioration in the number of dealers or quality of our network of dealers would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our success depends, in part, on the financial health of our dealers and their continued access to financing. Because we sell nearly all of our products through dealers, their financial health is critical to our success. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected if the financial health of the dealers that sell our products suffers. Their financial health may suffer for a variety of reasons, including a downturn in general economic conditions, rising interest rates, higher rents, increased labor costs and taxes, compliance with regulations, and personal financial issues. In addition, our dealers require adequate liquidity to finance their operations, including purchases of our products. Dealers are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could unfavorably affect their liquidity positions, including, among other things, continued access to adequate financing sources on a timely basis on reasonable terms. These sources of financing are vital to our ability to sell products through our distribution network. Access to floor plan financing generally facilitates our dealers’ ability to purchase boats from us, and their financed purchases reduce our working capital requirements. If floor plan financing were not available to our dealers or if the cost of the financing increases, our sales and our working capital levels would be adversely affected. The availability and terms of financing offered by our dealers’ floor plan financing providers will continue to be influenced by: 14 • their ability to access certain capital markets and to fund their operations in a cost-effective manner; • changes in interest rates; • the performance of their overall credit portfolios; • their willingness to accept the risks associated with lending to dealers; and • the overall creditworthiness of those dealers. We may be required to repurchase inventory of certain dealers. Many of our dealers have floor plan financing arrangements with third-party finance companies that enable the dealers to purchase our products. In connection with these agreements, we may have an obligation to repurchase our products from a finance company under certain circumstances, and we may not have any control over the timing or amount of any repurchase obligation nor have access to capital on terms acceptable to us to satisfy any repurchase obligation. This obligation is triggered if a dealer defaults on its debt obligations to a finance company, the finance company repossesses the boat and the boat is returned to us. Our obligation to repurchase a repossessed boat for the unpaid balance of our original invoice price for the boat is subject to reduction or limitation based on the age and condition of the boat at the time of repurchase, and in certain cases, by an aggregate cap on repurchase obligations associated with a particular floor plan financing program. In addition, applicable laws regulating dealer relations may also require us to repurchase our products from our dealers under certain circumstances, and we may not have any control over the timing or amount of any repurchase obligation nor have access to capital on terms acceptable to us to satisfy any repurchase obligation. If we were obligated to repurchase a significant number of units under any repurchase agreement or under applicable dealer laws, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected. If we fail to manage our manufacturing levels while still addressing the seasonal retail pattern for our products, our business and margins may suffer. The seasonality of retail demand for our products, together with our goal of balancing production throughout the year, requires us to manage our manufacturing and allocate our products to our dealer network to address anticipated retail demand. Our dealers must manage seasonal changes in consumer demand and inventory. If our dealers reduce their inventories in response to weakness in retail demand, we could be required to reduce our production, resulting in lower rates of absorption of fixed costs in our manufacturing and, therefore, lower margins. As a result, we must balance the economies of level production with the seasonal retail sales pattern experienced by our dealers. Failure to adjust manufacturing levels adequately may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We have a large fixed cost base that will affect our profitability if our sales decrease. The fixed cost levels of operating a powerboat manufacturer can put pressure on profit margins when sales and production decline. Our profitability depends, in part, on our ability to spread fixed costs over a sufficiently large number of products sold and shipped, and if we make a decision to reduce our rate of production, gross or net margins could be negatively affected. Consequently, decreased demand or the need to reduce production can lower our ability to absorb fixed costs and materially impact our financial condition or results of operations. Our industry is characterized by intense competition, which affects our sales and profits. The premium performance sport boat, outboard and pontoon boat categories and the powerboat industry as a whole are highly competitive for consumers and dealers. We also compete against consumer demand for used boats. Competition affects our ability to succeed in both the markets we currently serve and new markets that we may enter in the future. Competition is based primarily on brand name, price, product selection, and product performance. We compete with several large manufacturers that may have greater financial, marketing, and other resources than we do and who are represented by dealers in the markets in which we now operate and into which we plan to expand. We also compete with a variety of small, independent manufacturers. We cannot provide assurance that we will not face greater competition from existing large or small manufacturers or that we will be able to compete successfully with new competitors. Our failure to compete effectively with our current and future competitors would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our sales may be adversely impacted by increased consumer preference for used boats or the supply of new boats by competitors in excess of demand. During the economic downturn that commenced in 2008, we observed a shift in consumer demand toward purchasing more used boats, primarily because prices for used boats are typically lower than retail prices for new boats. If this were to occur again, it could have the 15 effect of reducing demand among retail purchasers for our new boats. Also, while we have taken steps designed to balance production volumes for our boats with demand, our competitors could choose to reduce the price of their products, which could have the effect of reducing demand for our new boats. Reduced demand for new boats could lead to reduced sales by us, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Our sales and profitability depend, in part, on the successful introduction of new products. Market acceptance of our products depends on our technological innovation and our ability to implement technology in our boats. Our sales and profitability may be adversely affected by difficulties or delays in product development, such as an inability to develop viable or innovative new products. Our failure to introduce new technologies and product offerings that consumers desire could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Also, we have been able to achieve higher margins in part as a result of the introduction of new features or enhancements to our existing boat models. If we fail to introduce new features or those we introduce fail to gain market acceptance, our margins may suffer. In addition, some of our direct competitors and indirect competitors may have significantly more resources to develop and patent new technologies. It is possible that our competitors will develop and patent equivalent or superior technologies and other products that compete with ours. They may assert these patents against us and we may be required to license these patents on unfavorable terms or cease using the technology covered by these patents, either of which would harm our competitive position and may materially adversely affect our business. We also cannot be certain that our products or features have not infringed or will not infringe the proprietary rights of others. Any such infringement could cause third parties, including our competitors, to bring claims against us, resulting in significant costs and potential damages. Our international markets require significant management attention, expose us to difficulties presented by international economic, political, legal, and business factors, and may not be successful or produce desired levels of sales and profitability. We currently sell our products throughout the world. International markets have been, and will continue to be, a focus for sales growth. We believe many opportunities exist in the international markets, and over time we intend for international sales to comprise a larger percentage of our total revenue. Several factors, including weakened international economic conditions, could adversely affect such growth and there can be no assurance that we will be able to sustain our current international sales levels in the future. The expansion of our existing international operations and entry into additional international markets require significant management attention. Some of the countries in which we market, and in which our distributors or licensee(s) sell our products, are subject to political, economic, or social instability. Our international operations expose us and our representatives, agents, and distributors to risks inherent in operating in foreign jurisdictions. These risks include, but are not limited to: • increased costs of customizing products for foreign countries; • unfamiliarity with local demographics, consumer preferences, and discretionary spending patterns; • difficulties in attracting customers due to a reduced level of customer familiarity with our brand; • competition with new, unfamiliar competitors; • the imposition of additional foreign governmental controls or regulations, including rules relating to environmental, health, and safety matters and regulations, and other laws applicable to publicly-traded companies, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA; • new or enhanced trade restrictions and restrictions on the activities of foreign agents, representatives, and distributors; • the imposition of increases in costly and lengthy import and export licensing and other compliance requirements, customs duties and tariffs, license obligations, and other non-tariff barriers to trade; • changes to the U.S.’s participation in, withdrawal out of, renegotiation of certain international trade agreements or other major trade related issues including the non-renewal of expiring favorable tariffs granted to developing countries, tariff quotas, and retaliatory tariffs, trade sanctions, new or onerous trade restrictions, embargoes and other stringent government controls; • the relative strength of the U.S. dollar compared to local currency, making our products less price-competitive relative to products manufactured outside of the U.S.; • laws and business practices favoring local companies; • longer payment cycles and difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems; • difficulties in enforcing or defending intellectual property rights; and 16 • insurrection or war that may disrupt or limit our relationships with our foreign customers. Our international operations may not produce desired levels of total sales, or one or more of the foregoing factors may harm our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Our results after acquisitions may suffer if we do not effectively manage our expanded operations following our recent acquisitions. The size of our business has increased significantly as a result of our acquisitions. Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to manage this expanded business, which will pose substantial challenges for management, including challenges related to the management and monitoring of additional operations and associated increased costs and complexity. There can be no assurances we will be successful or that we will realize the expected benefits currently anticipated from these or any other acquisitions. We have and will continue to incur significant acquisition-related integration costs and transaction expenses in connection with the acquisitions and the related financing transactions. We are currently implementing a plan to integrate the operations of our recent acquisitions of NauticStar and Crest. In connection with those plans, we have incurred, and anticipate that we may continue to incur, certain non-recurring charges. However, we cannot currently identify the timing, nature and amount of all such charges. Further, we incurred significant transaction costs relating to negotiating and completing the acquisitions. These integration costs and transaction expenses are and will continue to be charged as an expense in the period incurred. The significant transaction costs and integration costs could materially affect our results of operations in the period in which such charges are recorded. Although we believe that the elimination of duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the business, will offset incremental transaction and integration costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, or at all. The acquisitions may underperform relative to our expectations. We may not be able to maintain the levels of revenue, earnings or operating efficiency as a combined business that MasterCraft, NauticStar, and Crest have previously achieved or might achieve separately. The business and financial performance of the acquisitions are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including the risk of the loss of, or changes to, its relationships with its dealers and suppliers, increased product liability and warranty claims, and negative publicity or other events that could diminish the value of the NauticStar or Crest brand, which in turn could also adversely affect the MasterCraft brand. If we are unable to achieve the same growth, revenues and profitability that our acquisitions have achieved in the past, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected. In relation to such acquisitions, we have recognized significantly higher amounts of intangible assets, including goodwill. These intangible assets will be subject to impairment testing, and we could incur a significant impact to our financial statements in the form of impairment charges if assumptions and expectations related to our acquisitions are not realized. Rising concern regarding international tariffs could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. The current political landscape has introduced significant uncertainty with respect to future trade regulations and existing international trade agreements, as shown by the recent U.S.-initiated renegotiation of the North America Free Trade Agreement, and Brexit in Europe. This uncertainty includes the possibility of imposing tariffs or penalties on products manufactured outside the U.S., including the recent announcement of the U.S. government’s institution of tariffs on a range of products from China, and the potential for increased trade barriers between the UK and the European Union. The institution of global trade tariffs carries the risk of negatively affecting global economic conditions, which could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations. In addition, U.S. initiated tariffs on certain foreign goods, including raw materials, commodities, and products manufactured outside the United States that are used in our manufacturing processes may cause our manufacturing cost to rise, which would have a negative impact on our business and results of operations. The unaudited pro forma financial information we filed on Form 8-K/A on December 7, 2018 may not be indicative of our future results with Crest. The unaudited pro forma financial information we filed on Form 8-K/A on December 7, 2018 may not reflect what our results of operations, financial position and cash flows would have been after giving effect to the acquisition of Crest, as well as the related financing during the periods presented or be indicative of what our results of operations, financial position and cash flows may be in the future. The unaudited pro forma financial information has been derived from our historical financial statements and the historical 17 financial statements of Crest , as well as adjustments and assumptions made regarding the combined entity following the transaction. While we believe these assumptions and adjustments are reasonable, they are preliminary in nature and difficult to make with accuracy. Moreover, the unaudited pro forma financial statements do not reflect all costs that may be incurred by the combined company in connection with the transaction. The assump tions used and adjustments made in preparing the unaudited pro forma financial information may prove to be inaccurate. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could result in declines in our reported sales and net earnings. The changing relationships of primarily the U.S. dollar to the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar, the Euro, the British pound sterling, the Japanese yen, and certain other foreign currencies have from time to time had a negative impact on our results of operations. Fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to these foreign currencies can adversely affect the price of our products in foreign markets and the costs we incur to import certain components for our products. We will often attempt to offset these higher prices with increased discounts, which can lead to reduced net sales per unit. We compete with a variety of other activities for consumers’ scarce leisure time. Our boats are used for recreational and sport purposes, and demand for our boats may be adversely affected by competition from other activities that occupy consumers’ leisure time and by changes in consumer lifestyle, usage pattern, or taste. Similarly, an overall decrease in consumer leisure time may reduce consumers’ willingness to purchase and enjoy our products. Our success depends on the continued strength of our brands and the value of our brands, and sales of our products could be diminished if we, the athletes who use our products, or the sports and activities in which our products are used are associated with negative publicity. We believe that our brands are a significant contributor to the success of our business and that maintaining and enhancing our brands is important to expanding our consumer and dealer base. Failure to continue to protect our brands may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Negative publicity, including that resulting from severe injuries or death occurring in the sports and activities in which our products are used, could negatively affect our reputation and result in restrictions, recalls, or bans on the use of our products. Further, actions taken by athletes associated with our products that harm the reputations of those athletes could also harm our brand image and adversely affect our financial condition. If the popularity of the sports and activities for which we design, manufacture, and sell products were to decrease as a result of these risks or any negative publicity, sales of our products could decrease, which could have an adverse effect on our net sales, profitability, and operating results. In addition, if we become exposed to additional claims and litigation relating to the use of our products, our reputation may be adversely affected by such claims, whether or not successful, including by generating potential negative publicity about our products, which could adversely impact our business and financial condition. We may not be able to execute our manufacturing strategy successfully, which could cause the profitability of our products to suffer. Our manufacturing strategy is designed to improve product quality and increase productivity, while reducing costs and increasing flexibility to respond to ongoing changes in the marketplace. To implement this strategy, we must be successful in our continuous improvement efforts, which depend on the involvement of management, production employees, and suppliers. Any inability to achieve these objectives could adversely impact the profitability of our products and our ability to deliver desirable products to our consumers. Our ability to meet our manufacturing workforce needs is crucial to our results of operations and future sales and profitability. We rely on the existence of an available hourly workforce to manufacture our boats. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to attract and retain qualified employees to meet current or future manufacturing needs at a reasonable cost, or at all. Although none of our employees are currently covered by collective bargaining agreements, we cannot provide assurance that our employees will not elect to be represented by labor unions in the future, which could increase our labor costs. Additionally, with unemployment rates at low levels, competition for qualified employees could require us to pay higher wages to attract a sufficient number of employees. Significant increases in manufacturing workforce costs could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. We rely on third-party suppliers and, in particular, suppliers of the engine packages used in the manufacturing of our boats. We depend on third-party suppliers to provide components and raw materials essential to the construction of our boats. While we believe that our relationships with our current suppliers are sufficient to provide the materials necessary to meet present production demand, we cannot provide assurance that these relationships will continue or that the quantity or quality of materials available from these suppliers will be sufficient to meet our future needs, irrespective of whether we successfully implement our growth strategy. As production 18 increases, our need for raw materials and supplies will increase. Our suppliers must be prepared to ramp up operations and, in many cases, hire additional workers and/or expand capacity in order to fulfill the orders placed by us and other customers. Operational and financial difficulties that our suppliers may face in the future could adversely affect their ability to supply us with the parts and components we need, which could significantly disrupt our operations. The availability and cost of engines used in the manufacture of our boats are especially critical. For fiscal 2019, we purchased all of the inboard engine packages for our MasterCraft brand boats from Ilmor. We also maintain a strong and long-standing relationship with our primary supplier of NauticStar engine packages, Yamaha, and our primary supplier of Crest engine packages, Mercury. While we believe that our relationships with these suppliers are sufficient to provide the materials necessary to meet present production demand, there can be no assurance that these relationships will continue or that the quantity or quality of the engines provided will be sufficient to meet our future needs, irrespective of whether we successfully implement our growth strategy. If we are required to replace these suppliers, it could cause a decrease in products available for sale or an increase in the cost of goods sold, either of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition to the risk of interruption of our engine supply, these suppliers could potentially exert significant bargaining power over price, quality, warranty claims, or other terms relating to the engines we use. We are required to purchase a minimum volume of engines from Ilmor annually. In addition, MasterCraft could be required to pay a penalty to Ilmor in order to maintain exclusivity if annual purchases under the agreement fail to meet a certain threshold. While these minimums are significantly below our current volumes, there can be no assurance that we will continue to meet these minimums in the future. Termination or interruption of informal supply arrangements could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. We have informal supply arrangements with some of our suppliers, including the sole supplier of our gas and ballast tanks. In the event of a termination of a supply arrangement, there can be no assurance that alternate supply arrangements will be made on satisfactory terms. If we need to enter into supply arrangements on unsatisfactory terms, or if there are any delays to our supply arrangements, it could adversely affect our business and operating results. We depend on key personnel and we may not be able to retain them or attract, assimilate, and retain highly qualified employees in the future. Our future success will depend in significant part on the continued service of our senior management team and our continuing ability to attract, assimilate, and retain highly qualified and skilled managerial, product development, manufacturing, marketing, and other personnel. The loss of the services of any members of our senior management or other key personnel or the inability to hire or retain qualified personnel in the future could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We may attempt to grow our business through additional acquisitions or strategic alliances and new partnerships, which we may not be successful in completing or integrating . We may in the future explore acquisitions and strategic alliances that will enable us to acquire complementary skills and capabilities, offer new products, expand our consumer base, enter new product categories or geographic markets, and obtain other competitive advantages. We cannot provide assurance, however, that we will identify acquisition candidates or strategic partners that are suitable to our business, obtain financing on satisfactory terms, complete acquisitions or strategic alliances, or successfully integrate acquired operations into our existing operations. Once integrated, acquired operations may not achieve anticipated levels of sales or profitability, or otherwise perform as expected. Acquisitions also involve special risks, including risks associated with unanticipated challenges, liabilities and contingencies, and diversion of management attention and resources from our existing operations. Similarly, our partnership with leading franchises from other industries to market our products or with third-party technology providers to introduce new technology to the market may not achieve anticipated levels of consumer enthusiasm and acceptance, or achieve anticipated levels of sales or profitability, or otherwise perform as expected. Our intellectual property rights may be inadequate to protect our business. We attempt to protect our intellectual property through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, protected design, and trade secret laws. We hold patents, trademarks, copyrights, and design rights relating to various aspects of our products and believe that proprietary technical know-how is important to our business. Proprietary rights relating to our products are protected from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that they are covered by valid and enforceable patents, trademarks, or copyrights, to the extent they are protected designs, or to the extent they are maintained in confidence as trade secrets. We cannot be certain that we will be issued any patents from any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us, or that the claims allowed under any issued patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. Further, the patents we own could be 19 challenged, invalidated, or circumvented by others. F urther, we cannot provide assurance that competitors will not infringe our patents, or that we will have adequate resources to enforce our patents. We also rely on unpatented proprietary technology. It is possible that others will independently develop the same or similar technology or otherwise obtain access to our unpatented technology. To protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information, we require employees, consultants, advisors, and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements. We cannot provide assurance that these agreements will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets, know-how, or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use, misappropriation, or disclosure of such trade secrets, know-how, or other proprietary information. If we are unable to maintain the proprietary nature of our technologies, we could be materially adversely affected. Further, we have attempted to protect certain of our vessel hull designs by seeking to register those designs with the U.S. Copyright Office. We cannot provide assurance that our applications will be approved. If approved, protection of the vessel design lasts ten years. However, our protected vessel hull designs could be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented by others. Further, we cannot provide assurance that competitors will not infringe our designs, or that we will have adequate resources to enforce our rights. We rely on our trademarks, trade names, and brand names to distinguish our products from the products of our competitors and have registered or applied to register many of these trademarks. We cannot provide assurance that our trademark applications will be approved. Third parties may also oppose our trademark applications, or otherwise challenge our use of the trademarks. In the event that our trademarks are successfully challenged, we could be forced to rebrand our products, which could result in loss of brand recognition, and could require us to devote resources to advertising and marketing new brands. Further, we cannot provide assurance that competitors will not infringe our trademarks, or that we will have adequate resources to enforce our trademarks. If third parties claim that we infringe on their intellectual property rights, our financial condition could be adversely affected. We face the risk of claims that we have infringed third parties’ intellectual property rights. Any claims of patent or other intellectual property infringement, even those without merit, could be expensive and time consuming to defend, cause us to cease making, licensing, or using products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property, require us to redesign, reengineer, or rebrand our products, if feasible, divert management’s attention and resources, or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use a third party’s intellectual property. Any royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. A successful claim of infringement against us could result in our being required to pay significant damages, enter into costly license or royalty agreements, or stop the sale of certain products, any of which could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. While we are not currently involved in any outstanding intellectual property litigation that we believe, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations, we cannot predict the outcome of any pending litigation and an unfavorable outcome could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Product liability, warranty, personal injury, property damage, and recall claims may materially affect our financial condition and damage our reputation. We are engaged in a business that exposes us to claims for product liability and warranty claims in the event our products actually or allegedly fail to perform as expected, or the use of our products results, or is alleged to result, in property damage, personal injury, or death. We have in the past incurred such liabilities and may in the future be exposed to liability for such claims. Although we maintain product and general liability insurance of the types and in the amounts that we believe are customary for the industry, we are not fully insured against all such potential claims. We may experience legal claims in excess of our insurance coverage or claims that are not covered by insurance, either of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Adverse determination of material product liability and warranty claims made against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and harm our reputation. In addition, if any of our products are, or are alleged to be, defective, we may be required to participate in a recall of that product if the defect or alleged defect relates to safety. These and other claims we may face could be costly to us and require substantial management attention. Significant product repair and/or replacement due to product warranty claims or product recalls could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. We provide a limited warranty for our products. We may provide additional warranties related to certain promotional programs, as well as warranties in certain geographical markets as determined by local regulations and market conditions. Although we employ quality control procedures, sometimes a product is distributed that needs repair or replacement. Our standard warranties require us or our dealers to repair or replace defective products during such warranty periods at no cost to the consumer. Historically, product recalls have been administered through our dealers and distributors. The repair and replacement costs we could 20 incur in connection with a recall could adversely affect our business. In addition, product recalls could harm our reputation and cause us to lose customers, particularly if recalls cause consumers to question the safety or reliability of our products. The nature of our business exposes us to workers’ compensation claims and other workplace liabilities. Certain materials we use require our employees to handle potentially hazardous or toxic substances. While our employees who handle these and other potentially hazardous or toxic materials receive specialized training and wear protective clothing, there is still a risk that they, or others, may be exposed to these substances. Exposure to these substances could result in significant injury to our employees and damage to our property or the property of others, including natural resource damage. Our personnel are also at risk for other workplace- related injuries, including slips and falls. We have in the past been, and may in the future be, subject to fines, penalties, and other liabilities in connection with any such injury or damage. Although we currently maintain what we believe to be suitable and adequate insurance in excess of our self-insured amounts, we may be unable to maintain such insurance on acceptable terms or such insurance may not provide adequate protection against potential liabilities. We may be subject to information technology system failures, network disruptions, and breaches in data security. We use many information technology systems and their underlying infrastructure to operate our business. The size and complexity of our computer systems make them potentially vulnerable to breakdown, malicious intrusion, and random attack. Likewise, data privacy breaches by employees or others with permitted access to our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. While we have invested in protection of data and information technology, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems that could adversely affect our business. An increase in energy costs may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Higher energy costs result in increases in operating expenses at our manufacturing facility and in the expense of shipping products to our dealers. In addition, increases in energy costs may adversely affect the pricing and availability of petroleum-based raw materials, such as resins and foams that are used in our products. Also, higher fuel prices may have an adverse effect on demand for our boats, as they increase the cost of ownership and operation. We are subject to U.S. and other anti-corruption laws, trade controls, economic sanctions, and similar laws and regulations, including those in the jurisdictions where we operate. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us to civil, criminal, and administrative penalties and harm our reputation. Doing business on a worldwide basis requires us to comply with the laws and regulations of various foreign jurisdictions. These laws and regulations place restrictions on our operations, trade practices, partners, and investment decisions. In particular, our operations are subject to U.S. and foreign anti-corruption and trade control laws and regulations, such as the FCPA, export controls, and economic sanctions programs, including those administered by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC. As a result of doing business in foreign countries and with foreign partners, we are exposed to a heightened risk of violating anti-corruption and trade control laws and sanctions regulations. The FCPA prohibits us from providing anything of value to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or securing any improper business advantage. It also requires us to keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect our transactions. Economic sanctions programs restrict our business dealings with certain sanctioned countries, persons, and entities. In addition, because we act through dealers and distributors, we face the risk that our dealers, distributors, or consumers might further distribute our products to a sanctioned person or entity, or an ultimate end-user in a sanctioned country, which might subject us to an investigation concerning compliance with OFAC or other sanctions regulations. Violations of anti-corruption and trade control laws and sanctions regulations are punishable by civil penalties, including fines, denial of export privileges, injunctions, asset seizures, debarment from government contracts, and revocations or restrictions of licenses, as well as criminal fines and imprisonment. We cannot provide assurance that all of our local, strategic, or joint partners will comply with these laws and regulations, in which case we could be held liable for actions taken inside or outside of the U.S., even though our partners may not be subject to these laws. Such a violation could materially and adversely affect our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition. Our continued international expansion, including in developing countries, and our development of new partnerships and joint venture relationships worldwide increase the risk of FCPA or OFAC violations in the future. 21 If we are unable to comply with environmental and other regulatory requirements, our business may be exposed to material liability and/or fines. Our operations are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations, including those concerning product safety, environmental protection, and occupational health and safety. Some of these laws and regulations require us to obtain permits and limit our ability to discharge hazardous materials into the environment. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we may be subject to civil or criminal enforcement actions that could result in the assessment of fines and penalties, obligations to conduct remedial or corrective actions, or, in extreme circumstances, revocation of our permits or injunctions preventing some or all of our operations. In addition, the components of our boats must meet certain regulatory standards, including stringent air emission standards for boat engines. Failure to meet these standards could result in an inability to sell our boats in key markets, which would adversely affect our business. Moreover, compliance with these regulatory requirements could increase the cost of our products, which in turn, may reduce consumer demand. While we believe that we are in material compliance with applicable federal, state, local, and foreign regulatory requirements, and hold all licenses and permits required thereunder, we cannot provide assurance that we will, at all times, be able to continue to comply with applicable regulatory requirements. Compliance with increasingly stringent regulatory and permit requirements may, in the future, cause us to incur substantial capital costs and increase our cost of operations, or may limit our operations, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition. As with most boat construction businesses, our manufacturing processes involve the use, handling, storage, and contracting for recycling or disposal of hazardous substances and wastes. The failure to manage or dispose of such hazardous substances and wastes properly could expose us to material liability or fines, including liability for personal injury or property damage due to exposure to hazardous substances, damages to natural resources, or for the investigation and remediation of environmental conditions. Under environmental laws, we may be liable for remediation of contamination at sites where our hazardous wastes have been disposed or at our current or former facilities, regardless of whether such facilities are owned or leased or whether the environmental conditions were created by us, a prior owner or tenant, or a third-party. While we do not believe that we are presently subject to any such liabilities, we cannot assure you that environmental conditions relating to our prior, existing, or future sites or operations or those of predecessor companies will not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition. Natural disasters, environmental disasters, the effects of climate change, or other disruptions at our manufacturing facilities or in other regions of the United States could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We rely on the continuous operation of our manufacturing facilities in Vonore, Tennessee, Armory, Mississippi, and Owosso, Michigan for the production of our products. Any natural disaster or other serious disruption to our facilities due to fire, snow, flood, earthquake, or any other unforeseen circumstance could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Changes in climate could adversely affect our operations by limiting or increasing the costs associated with equipment or fuel supplies. In addition, adverse weather conditions, such as increased frequency and/or severity of storms, or floods could impair our ability to operate by damaging our facilities and equipment or restricting product delivery to customers. The occurrence of any disruption at our manufacturing facilities, even for a short period of time, may have an adverse effect on our productivity and profitability, during and after the period of the disruption. These disruptions may also cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment, and environmental damage. Although we maintain property, casualty, and business interruption insurance of the types and in the amounts that we believe are customary for the industry, we are not fully insured against all potential natural disasters or other disruptions to our manufacturing facilities. In addition, we have dealers and third-party suppliers located in regions of the United States that have been and may be exposed to damaging storms, such as hurricanes and tornados, floods and environmental disasters. Although preventative measures may help to mitigate damage, the damage and disruption resulting from natural and environmental disasters may be significant. Such disasters can disrupt our dealers, suppliers, or customers, which can interrupt our operational processes and our sales and profits. Increases in income tax rates or changes in income tax laws or enforcement could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. Changes in domestic and international tax legislation could expose us to additional tax liability. Although we monitor changes in tax laws and work to mitigate the impact of proposed changes, such changes may negatively impact our financial results. In addition, increases in individual income tax rates would negatively affect our potential consumers’ discretionary income and could decrease the demand for our products. 22 Our credit facilities contain covenants which may limit our operating flexibility; failure to comply with covenants may result in our lenders restricting or terminating our ability to borrow under such credit facilities. In the past, we have relied on our existing credit facilities to provide us with adequate liquidity to operate our business. The availability of borrowing amounts under our credit facilities is dependent on compliance with the debt covenants set forth in our credit agreement. Violation of those covenants, whether as a result of operating losses or otherwise, could result in our lenders restricting or terminating our borrowing ability under our credit facilities. If our lenders reduce or terminate our access to amounts under our credit facilities, we may not have sufficient capital to fund our working capital and other needs, and we may need to secure additional capital or financing to fund our operations or to repay outstanding debt under our credit facilities. We cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in ensuring the availability of amounts under our credit facilities or in raising additional capital, or that any amount, if raised, will be sufficient to meet our cash needs or will be on terms as favorable as those which have been available to us historically. If we are not able to maintain our ability to borrow under our credit facilities, or to raise additional capital when needed, our business and operations will be materially adversely affected. Risks Relating to Ownership of our Common Stock Shareholders may be diluted by future issuances of common stock in connection with our incentive plans, acquisitions, or otherwise; future sales of such shares in the public market, or the expectations that such sales may occur, could lower our stock price. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue shares of common stock and options, rights, warrants, and appreciation rights relating to common stock for the consideration and on the terms and conditions established by our board of directors in its sole discretion, whether in connection with acquisitions or otherwise. We have reserved shares for issuance under the Amended and Restated MCBC Holdings, Inc. 2015 Incentive Award Plan (“2015 Incentive Award Plan”) in an amount equal to 1,613,864 shares. Any common stock that we issue, including under our 2015 Incentive Award Plan or other equity incentive plans that we may adopt in the future, would dilute the percentage ownership of holders of our common stock. Our common stock price may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance. It is possible that an active trading market for our common stock will not be sustained, which could make it difficult for investors to sell their shares of our common stock at an attractive price or at all. Volatility in the market price of our common stock may prevent investors from being able to sell their shares at or above the price they paid for them. Many factors, which are outside our control, may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly, including those described elsewhere in this “Risk Factors” section and this Form 10-K, as well as the following: • our operating and financial performance and prospects; • our quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in our industry compared to market expectations; • conditions that impact demand for our services; • future announcements concerning our business or our competitors’ businesses; • the public’s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements, and filings with the SEC; • coverage by or changes in financial estimates by securities analysts or failure to meet their expectations; • market and industry perception of our success, or lack thereof, in pursuing our growth strategy; • strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings; • changes in laws or regulations that adversely affect our industry or us; • changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations, or principles; • changes in senior management or key personnel; • issuances, exchanges or sales, or expected issuances, exchanges or sales of our capital stock; • changes in our dividend policy; • adverse resolution of new or pending litigation against us; and • changes in general market, economic, and political conditions in the U.S. and global economies or financial markets, including those resulting from natural disasters, terrorist attacks, acts of war, and responses to such events. 23 As a result, volatility in the market price of our common stock may prevent investors from being able to sell their common stock at or above the price they paid for it or at all. These broad market and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In addition, price volatility may be greater if the public float and trading volume of our common stock is low. As a result, investors may suffer a loss on their investment. We do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. While we have paid dividends in the past, we presently have no intention to pay dividends on our common stock at any time in the foreseeable future. Any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. Certain of our debt instruments contain covenants that restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us. In addition, we will be permitted under the terms of our debt instruments to incur additional indebtedness, which may restrict or prevent us from paying dividends on our common stock. Furthermore, our ability to declare and pay dividends may be limited by instruments governing future outstanding indebtedness we may incur. Delaware law and certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may prevent efforts by our stockholders to change the direction or management of our Company. We are a Delaware corporation, and the anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated by-laws currently contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult without the approval of our board of directors, including, but not limited to, the following: • our board of directors is currently classified into three classes, each of which serves for a staggered three-year term; • only our board of directors may call special meetings of our stockholders; and • we require advance notice and duration of ownership requirements for stockholder proposals. These provisions could discourage, delay, or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and cause us to take other corporate actions they desire. In addition, because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions could in turn affect any attempt by our stockholders to replace current members of our management team. For as long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to comply with certain reporting requirements, including those relating to accounting standards and disclosure about our executive compensation, that apply to other public companies. We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies,” including, but not limited to, (i) not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (ii) reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and (iii) exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and of stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We have elected to adopt these reduced disclosure requirements. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive as a result of our taking advantage of these exemptions and as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. We will remain an “emerging growth company” until the earliest of (i) the last day of fiscal year during which we had total annual gross revenues of at least $1.07 billion, (ii) June 30, 2021, which is the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of completion of our initial public offering, (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.07 billion in non-convertible debt, or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a “large accelerated filer,” as defined under the Exchange Act. 24 The obligations associated with being a public company require significant resources and management attent ion, which may divert us from our business operations. As a result of our initial public offering, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly, and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we establish and maintain effective internal controls and procedures for financial reporting. As a result, we have and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses that we did not previously incur. In addition, the need to establish the corporate infrastructure demanded of a public company may divert management’s attention from implementing our business strategy, which could prevent us from improving our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We have made, and will continue to make, changes to our internal controls, including information technology controls, and procedures for financial reporting and accounting systems to meet our reporting obligations as a public company. However, the measures we take may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations as a public company. If we do not continue to develop and implement the right processes and tools to manage our changing enterprise and maintain our culture, our ability to compete successfully and achieve our business objectives could be impaired, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, we cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur to comply with these requirements. We anticipate that these costs will be material to our general and administrative expenses. Furthermore, as a public company, we have and will continue to incur additional legal, accounting, and other expenses that have not been reflected in our historical financial statements. In addition, rules implemented by the SEC and NASDAQ have imposed various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. These rules and regulations result in our incurring legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly. For example, we expect these rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to maintain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to maintain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified people to serve on our board of directors, on our board committees, or as executive officers. Our failure to achieve and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act as a public company could have a material adverse effect on our business and share price. Prior to the completion of our initial public offering, we had not operated as a public company and were not required to independently comply with Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, starting with the second annual report that we file with the SEC. We were required to meet these standards in the course of preparing our financial statements as of and for the year ended June 30, 2017, and our management is required to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for such year and annually thereafter. Additionally, once we are no longer an “emerging growth company,” our independent registered public accounting firm will be required pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis. The rules governing the standards that must be met for our management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing, and possible remediation. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. We are currently in the process of reviewing, documenting, and testing our internal control over financial reporting. We may encounter problems or delays in implementing any changes necessary to make a favorable assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, we may encounter problems or delays in completing the implementation of any requested improvements and receiving a favorable attestation in connection with the attestation to be provided by our independent registered public accounting firm after we cease to be an emerging growth company. If we cannot favorably assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide an unqualified attestation report on our internal controls after we cease to be an emerging growth company, investors could lose confidence in our financial information and the price of our common stock could decline. Additionally, the existence of any material weakness or significant deficiency may require management to devote significant time and incur significant expense to remediate any such material weaknesses or significant deficiencies and management may not be able to remediate any such material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in a timely manner. The existence of any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could also result in errors in our financial statements that could require us to make out of period adjustments, restate our financial statements, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, and cause stockholders to lose confidence in our reported financial information, all of which could materially and adversely affect our business and share price. 25 If securities analysts do not publish re search or reports about our company, or if they issue unfavorable commentary about us or our industry or downgrade our common stock, the price of our common stock could decline. The trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that third-party securities analysts publish about our company and our industry. We may be unable or slow to attract research coverage and if one or more analysts cease coverage of our company, we could lose visibility in the market. In addition, one or more of these analysts could downgrade our common stock or issue other negative commentary about our company or our industry. As a result of one or more of these factors, the trading price of our common stock could decline. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS. None. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES. All our MasterCraft and Aviara boats are designed, manufactured, and lake-tested at our 250,000-square-foot manufacturing facility located on approximately 60 acres of lakefront land we own in Vonore, Tennessee.

Market Information Our common stock has been publicly traded on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol “MCFT” since July 17, 2015. Prior to that time, there was no public market for our common stock. On September 10, 2019, the last reported sale price on the NASDAQ Global Market of our common stock was $17.59 per share. As of September 6, 2019, we had approximately 5,700 holders of record of our common stock. Capital Allocation Policy We presently intend to retain our earnings, if any, to finance the development and growth of our business and operations and do not anticipate declaring or paying cash dividends on our common stock, or repurchasing stock, in the foreseeable future. Any future determination as to the declaration and payment of dividends, or the repurchase of stock, if any, will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on then-existing conditions, including our operating results, financial condition, contractual restrictions, capital requirements, business prospects, and other factors our board of directors may deem relevant. See Item 1A “Risk Factors” — Risks Relating to Ownership of Our Common Stock. We do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. Stock Performance Graph This performance graph shall not be deemed “soliciting material” or to be “filed” with the SEC for purposes of Section 18 of the Exchange Act of 1934, or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that section, and shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any filing of ours under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act. The following stock performance graph illustrates the cumulative total shareholder return on our common stock for the period from July 17, 2015 (the first day of trading for our common stock) to June 30, 2019, as compared to the Russell 2000 Index and the Dow Jones US Recreational Products Index. 27 The comparison assumes (i) a hypothetical investment of $100 in our common stock and the two above mentioned indices on July 17, 2015 and (ii) the full reinvestment of all dividends. The comparisons in the graph and table are required by the SEC and are not in tended to be indicative of possible future performance of our common stock. Securities Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans For information regarding securities authorized for issuance under our equity compensation plans, see Note 13—Share-Based Compensation in Item 8 and Item 12: Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters.

(3) During fiscal 2019 and 2018, the Company acquired Crest and NauticStar, respectively, as described in Notes 5 and 16 in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (4) On June 30, 2012, the Company sold the trade name, tooling, certain machinery, and finished goods of our Hydra-Sports business to Hydra-Sports Custom Boats, LLC, an unaffiliated third party. We concurrently entered into an agreement with the purchaser to contract manufacture a specified number of Hydra-Sports models annually at established prices, using certain of the tooling and machinery assets sold to Hydra-Sports Custom Boats, LLC which remained in use by the Company at the Company’s manufacturing facility for the duration of the manufacturing contract. This manufacturing agreement expired on June 30, 2015 and we did not renew it. ( 5 ) Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA margin are non-GAAP financial measures. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA expressed as a percentage of net sales. For definitions of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and a reconciliation of each to net income, see Item 7 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. The following discussion and analysis should be read together with the sections entitled “Risk Factors,” “Selected Financial Data,” and the financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. In addition, the statements in this discussion and analysis regarding industry outlook, our expectations regarding the performance of our business, anticipated financial results, liquidity and the other non-historical statements are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the successful integration of NauticStar and Crest into our business and the risks and uncertainties described in “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and in “Risk Factors” above. Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements. Overview Fiscal 2019 was a record year, with net sales of $466.4 million, an increase of 40.2% from fiscal 2018, primarily due to strong boat sales from our MasterCraft brand, the October 2018 acquisition of Crest, and the inclusion of NauticStar in our fiscal 2019 first quarter results. Full year net income of $21.4 million was a decrease of 46.2% from fiscal 2018, with diluted earnings per share decreasing 46.2% to $1.14 per share. The significant decrease was driven by the negative impact of a $31.0 million non-cash goodwill and other intangible asset impairment at NauticStar principally as a result of a decline, in the fiscal fourth quarter, in the outlook for sales and operating performance relative to our acquisition plan. For more information regarding this impairment charge, see Note 8 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. NauticStar’s core industry category, the value-brand saltwater fishing boat segment, has experienced a recent slowing in demand, especially for boats less than 24 feet in length, which represent a material percentage of NauticStar’s current model mix. The decrease in net income and diluted earnings per share were offset by the Crest acquisition, which added $76.6 million in net sales, and continued strong operating results at MasterCraft. Recent Transactions Acquisition of Crest Marine, LLC On October 1, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Crest. The purchase price was $81.7 million, including customary adjustments for the amount of working capital in the acquired business at the closing date. A portion of the purchase price was deposited into an escrow account in order to secure certain post-closing obligations of the former members of Crest. The Company’s results of operations presented herein include Crest’s results from October 1, 2018 through June 30, 2019. Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement On October 1, 2018, we entered into a Fourth Amended and Restated Credit and Guaranty Agreement with a syndicate of certain financial institutions (the “Fourth Amended Credit Agreement”). The Fourth Amended Credit Agreement replaced the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated October 2, 2017. The Fourth Amended Credit Agreement provides us with a $190 million senior secured credit facility, consisting of a $75 million term loan and an $80 million term loan (together, the “Term Loans”) and a $35 million revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”). Proceeds from the $80 million term loan were used to fund a portion of the purchase price for the Crest acquisition. Key Performance Measures From time to time we use certain key performance measures in evaluating our business and results of operations and we may refer to one or more of these key performance measures in this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” These key performance measures include: • Unit volume — We define unit volume as the number of our boats sold to our dealers during a period. • Net sales per unit — We define net sales per unit as net sales divided by unit volume. 30 • Gross margin — We define gross margin as gross profit divided by net sales, expressed as a percentage. • Adjusted EBITDA — We define Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization, as further adjusted to eliminate certain non-cash charges and unusual items that we do not consider to be indicative of our ongoing operations. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, see “Non-GAAP Measures” below. • Adjusted Net Income — We define Adjusted Net Income as net income excluding income taxes adjusted to eliminate certain non-cash charges and unusual items that we do not consider to be indicative of our ongoing operations and an adjustment for income tax expense at a normalized annual effective tax rate. For a reconciliation of Adjusted Net Income, see “Non-GAAP Measures” below. Components of Results of Operations Net Sales We generate sales from the sale of boats, trailers, and accessories to our dealers. The substantial majority of our net sales are derived from the sale of boats, including optional features included at the time of the initial wholesale purchase of the boat. Net sales consist of the following: • Gross sales, which are derived from: • Boat sales — sales of boats to our dealer network. In addition, nearly all of our boat sales include optional feature upgrades, which increase the average selling price of our boats; and • Trailers, parts and accessories, and other revenues — sales of boat trailers, replacement and aftermarket boat parts and accessories, and transportation charges to our dealer network. • Net of: • Dealer programs and flooring subsidies — incentives, including rebates and subsidized flooring, we provide to our dealers to drive volume and level dealer purchases throughout the year. If a dealer meets certain volume levels over the course of the year during certain defined periods, the dealer will be entitled to a specified rebate. These rebates change annually and include volume and performance incentives. Dealers who participate in our floor plan financing program may be entitled to have their flooring costs subsidized by us to promote dealer orders in the off-season. Cost of Sales Our cost of sales includes all of the costs to manufacture our products, including raw materials, components, supplies, direct labor, and factory overhead. For components and accessories manufactured by third-party vendors, our costs are the amounts invoiced to us by the vendors. Cost of sales includes shipping and handling costs, depreciation expense related to manufacturing equipment and facilities, and warranty costs associated with the repair or replacement of our boats under warranty. Operating Expenses Our operating expenses include selling and marketing costs, general and administrative costs, amortization of intangible assets and impairment losses. These items include personnel and related expenses, non-manufacturing overhead, and various other operating expenses. Further, selling and marketing expenditures include the cost of advertising and marketing materials. General and administrative expenses include, among other things, salaries, benefits, and other personnel related expenses for employees engaged in product development, engineering, finance, information technology, human resources, and executive management. Also included are outside legal and accounting fees, investor relations, risk management (insurance), and other administrative costs. Other Expense Other expense includes interest expense. Interest expense consists of interest charged under our credit facilities, amortization of deferred debt issuance costs, and deferred debt issuance costs written off in connection with the pay down of amounts owed on our credit facilities. Income Tax Expense Our accounting for income tax expense reflects management’s assessment of future tax assets and liabilities based on assumptions and estimates for timing, likelihood of realization, and tax laws existing at the time of evaluation. We record a valuation allowance, when appropriate, to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. 31 Results of Operations The consolidated statements of operations presented below should be read together with “Selected Consolidated Financial Data,” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. We derived the consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017 from our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected in the future. For the Years Ended June 30, 2019 2018 2017 (Dollars in thousands, except unit volumes) Consolidated statement of operations : Net sales $ 466,381 $ 332,725 $ 228,634 Cost of sales 353,254 242,361 165,158 Gross profit 113,127 90,364 63,476 Operating expenses: Selling and marketing 17,670 13,011 9,380 General and administrative 27,706 19,773 20,474 Amortization of intangible assets 3,492 1,597 107 Goodwill and other intangible asset impairment 31,000 — — Total operating expenses 79,868 34,381 29,961 Operating income 33,259 55,983 33,515 Other expense: Interest expense 6,513 3,474 2,222 Income before income tax expense 26,746 52,509 31,293 Income tax expense 5,392 12,856 11,723 Net income $ 21,354 $ 39,653 $ 19,570 Additional financial and other data: Unit volume: MasterCraft 3,435 3,068 2,790 NauticStar 1,831 1,687 — Crest 2,078 — — MasterCraft net sales $ 311,830 $ 266,319 $ 228,634 NauticStar net sales 77,995 66,406 — Crest net sales 76,556 — — Consolidated net sales $ 466,381 $ 332,725 $ 228,634 Per Unit: MasterCraft sales $ 91 $ 87 $ 82 NauticStar sales 43 39 — Crest sales 37 — — Consolidated sales 64 70 82 Gross margin 24.3 % 27.2 % 27.8 % Fiscal 2019 Compared to Fiscal 2018 Net Sales. Net Sales for fiscal 2019 were $466.4 million, an increase of $133.7 million, or 40.2%, compared to $332.7 million for fiscal 2018. The gain was primarily due to: • an increase at MasterCraft of $45.5 million, or 17.1%, primarily driven by an increase in unit sales volume, favorable product mix and price increases, offset by higher discounts to support our Canadian and European Union dealers impacted by retaliatory import tariffs; • the inclusion of Crest, which grew net sales by $76.6 million; and 32 • a net $11.6 million increase in net sales for NauticStar, driven by the inclusion of NauticStar in our fiscal 2019 first quarter results, partially offset by a decrease in volume due to softnes s in NauticStar’s core market. Gross Profit. Gross profit increased $22.8 million, or 25.2%, to $113.1 million compared to $90.4 million for fiscal 2018. The increase was primarily due to: • an increase in MasterCraft unit sales volumes, price increases, and favorable product mix, offset by increased warranty costs and higher discounts to support Canadian and European Union dealers impacted by retaliatory import tariffs; • the inclusion of Crest, which contributed $13.6 million to gross profit; and partially offset by • a net $1.2 million decrease in gross profit for NauticStar, primarily driven by a decrease in volume, partially offset by the inclusion of NauticStar in our fiscal 2019 first quarter results. Given the above-mentioned factors, gross margin decreased to 24.3% for fiscal 2019 compared to 27.2% for fiscal 2018. Operating Expenses. • Operating expenses increased $45.5 million, or 132.3%, to $79.9 million for fiscal 2019 compared to $34.4 million for fiscal 2018. This increase resulted mainly from: o the $31.0 million goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge at NauticStar (see Note 8 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information); o the inclusion of Crest, which increased operating expenses by $6.5 million; o an increase of $2.3 million in startup costs related to Aviara; o the incremental inclusion of NauticStar in our fiscal 2019 first quarter results, which added $1.9 million; and o an increase of $1.9 million in intangible asset amortization, which includes the effects of both the NauticStar and Crest acquisitions, principally for dealer networks. • Operating expenses, as a percentage of net sales, increased by 6.8 percentage points to 17.1% for fiscal 2019 compared to 10.3% for fiscal 2018. This increase resulted primarily from the $31.0 million goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge at NauticStar. Excluding this non-cash impairment charge, acquisition-related and integration costs, and start-up costs for Aviara, operating expenses as a percentage of sales decreased 0.1 percentage points to 9.5% for fiscal 2019 compared to 9.6% for fiscal 2018. Other Expense. Interest expense increased $3.0 million or 87.5%, to $6.5 million for fiscal 2019 compared to $3.5 million for fiscal 2018. The increase is due to increased borrowings for the Crest acquisition under the Fourth Amended Credit Agreement compared to the principal balance owed under the term loan component of the prior credit agreement during fiscal 2018. Income Tax Expense. Our results for fiscal 2018 reflect the impact of the enactment of the Tax Reform Act, which was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The Tax Reform Act reduced federal corporate income tax rates and changed numerous other provisions. As we have a June 30 fiscal year-end, the lower corporate federal income tax rate was phased in, resulting in a U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 28.1% for our fiscal year ending June 30, 2018, and 21% for subsequent fiscal years. We have revalued our deferred tax assets and liabilities to the reduced rates based on the period in which those assets and liabilities are expected to reverse. The incorporation of the changes resulting from the Tax Reform Act in our tax related accounts during fiscal 2018 resulted in a decrease to our year to date effective tax rate due to the revaluation of our deferred tax accounts. The fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 included a year-to-date benefit of $0.6 million to reflect federal deferred taxes at the lower blended effective tax rate. Our income tax expense was $5.4 million for fiscal 2019, reflecting a reported effective tax rate of 20.2%. Our income tax expense was $12.9 million for fiscal 2018, reflecting a reported effective tax rate of 24.5%. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was lower than the 21% statutory rate primarily due to the permanent benefit associated with the foreign derived intangible income deduction, which was primarily offset by the inclusion of the state tax rate in the overall effective rate. 33 Fiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017 Net Sales . Our net sales for fiscal 2018 were $332.7 million, reflecting an increase of $104.1 million, or 45.5%, compared to $228.6 million for fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily due to: • an increase of 16.5%, or $37.7 million, attributable to MasterCraft, primarily due to an increase in unit sales volume, reduced retail rebate activity, favorable product mix and price increases; and • the inclusion of NauticStar increased net sales by 29.0%, or $66.4 million. Gross Profit . For fiscal 2018, our gross profit increased $26.9 million, or 42.4%, to $90.4 million compared to $63.5 million for fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily due to: • an increase in MasterCraft unit sales volume, price increases, lower warranty costs and reduced retail rebate activity, partially offset by higher material costs; and • the inclusion of NauticStar, which contributed $12.3 million to gross profit. Gross margin decreased to 27.2% for fiscal 2018 compared to 27.8% for fiscal 2017. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to the dilutive effect from the inclusion of NauticStar, which was partially offset by increased gross margin of MasterCraft. Operating Expenses. • Operating expenses increased $4.4 million, or 14.8%, to $34.4 million for fiscal 2018 compared to $30.0 million for fiscal 2017. This increase resulted mainly from: o the inclusion of NauticStar, which increased operating expenses by $5.6 million; o an increase in compensation costs; o an increase of $1.7 million for acquisition-related and integration costs, o and $0.6 million related to new brand startup costs; partially offset by o a decrease of $5.9 million in patent litigation costs, which was settled during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. • Operating expenses, as a percentage of net sales, decreased by 2.8 percentage points to 10.3% for fiscal 2018 compared to 13.1% for fiscal 2017. This favorable impact resulted from leverage experienced through significant net sales increases compared to the net increases in operating expenses. Other Expense. Interest expense increased $1.3 million or 56.3%, to $3.5 million for fiscal 2018 compared to $2.2 million for fiscal 2017. The increase is due to increased borrowings under the Third Term Loan compared to the principal balance owed under the term loan component of the Prior Credit Agreement during fiscal 2017. Income Tax Expense. Our results for fiscal 2018 reflect the impact of the enactment of the Tax Reform Act, which was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The Tax Reform Act reduced federal corporate income tax rates and changed numerous other provisions. As we have a June 30 fiscal year-end, the lower corporate federal income tax rate will be phased in, resulting in a U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 28.1% for our fiscal year ending June 30, 2018, and 21% for subsequent fiscal years. We have revalued our deferred tax assets and liabilities to the reduced rates based on the period in which those assets and liabilities are expected to reverse. The incorporation of the changes resulting from the Tax Reform Act in our tax related accounts during fiscal 2018 resulted in a decrease to our year to date effective tax rate due to the revaluation of our deferred tax accounts. The fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 included a year-to-date benefit of $647 to reflect federal deferred taxes at the lower blended effective tax rate. Our income tax expense was $12.9 million for fiscal 2018, reflecting a reported effective tax rate of 24.5%. Our income tax expense was $11.7 million for fiscal 2017, reflecting a reported effective tax rate of 37.5%. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 was lower than the 28.1% statutory rate primarily due to the impact of the Tax Reform Act, and a permanent benefit associated with the domestic production activities deduction, which was partially offset by the inclusion of the state tax rate in the overall effective rate. Non-GAAP Measures We define EBITDA as earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA further adjusted to eliminate certain non-cash charges and other items that we do not consider to be indicative of our ongoing operations, including goodwill and intangible impairment charges, transaction expenses associated with acquisitions, acquisition related inventory step-up adjustment, certain litigation charges, an out-of-period adjustment to correct an immaterial error related to our 34 warranty reserve, new brand startup costs, and our stock-based compensation . We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA expressed as a percenta ge of net sales. We define Adjusted Net Income as net income adjusted to eliminate certain non-cash charges and other items that we do not consider to be indicative of our ongoing operations, including goodwill and intangible impairment charges , transactio n expenses associated with acquisition s , acquisition related inventory step - up adjustment, certain litigation charges, an out-of-period adjustment to correct an immaterial error related to our warranty reserve, new brand startup costs, amortization of acqu ired intangible assets, and our stock-based compensation. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin , and Adjusted Net Income are not measures of net income or operating income as determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United State s, which we refer to as GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income are not measures of performance in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or operating cash flows determined in accordance with GAAP. Additiona lly, Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of cash flow for management’s discretionary use. We believe that the inclusion of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and Adjusted Net Income is appropriate to provide additional information to investors because securities analysts, noteholders and other investors use these non - GAAP financial measures to assess our operating performance across periods on a consistent basis and to evaluate the relative risk of an investment in our securities. W e use Adjusted Net Income to facilitate a comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis from period to period that, when viewed in combination with our results prepared in accordance with GAAP, provides a more complete understanding of fact ors and trends affecting our business than GAAP alone measures. We believe Adjusted Net Income assists our board of directors, management and investors in comparing our net income on a consistent basis from period to period because it removes non-cash ite ms and items not indicative of our ongoing operations. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of t hese limitations are: • Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; • Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; • Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; • Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our tax expense or any cash requirements to pay income taxes; • Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest payments on our indebtedness; and • Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters we do not consider to be indicative of our ongoing operations, but may nonetheless have a material impact on our results of operations. In addition, because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, including companies in our industry.

Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary liquidity and capital resource needs are to finance working capital, fund capital expenditures, service our debt, and fund potential business acquisitions. Our principal sources of funds is cash generated from operating activities and the refinance and/or issuance of long-term debt. As of June 30, 2019, we had borrowing availability of $35.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility. We believe our cash from operations, along with the ability to borrow, will be sufficient to provide for our liquidity and capital resource needs for at least the next 12 months. The following table summarizes the cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities: Fiscal Years 2019 2018 2017 (Dollars in thousands) Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 55,886 $ 49,397 $ 26,232 Investing activities (95,786 ) (85,720 ) (4,135 ) Financing activities 37,817 40,194 (18,132 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash $ (2,083 ) $ 3,871 $ 3,965 37 Operating Activities Our net cash provided by operating activities increased by $6.5 million, or 13.1%, for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018, to $55.9 million from $49.4 million. This increase was primarily due to an increase in operating income of $8.3 million, excluding the non-cash goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge of $31.0 million. Our operating income grew from an increase in MasterCraft unit sales volume, price increases, and favorable product mix, partially offset by increased warranty costs and higher discounts related to retaliatory import tariff support for our Canadian and European Union dealers. The inclusion of Crest and NauticStar’s incremental fiscal 2019 first quarter also drove the increase in our operating income. These increases were partially offset by an increase in cash paid for taxes and an increase in cash payments for interest related to the long-term debt used to fund the Crest acquisition. Our net cash provided by operating activities increased by $23.2 million, or 88.3%, for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017, to $49.4 million from $26.2 million. This increase was primarily due to an increase in operating income of $22.5 million of which $15.8 million was attributable to our MasterCraft segment. Our MasterCraft segment operating income grew from an increase in unit sales volume, price increases, lower warranty costs and reduced retail rebate activity, partially offset by higher material costs. The inclusion of NauticStar increased our operating income by $6.6 million. These increases were partially offset by an increase in cash paid for taxes and an increase in cash payments for interest related to an increase in our term loan balance when compared to the principal balance owed on our term loan during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities increased $10.0 million for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. This increase was partially due to the acquisition of Crest in October 2018, for cash consideration of $81.0 million, net of cash on hand. Remaining capital outlays consisted of purchases for manufacturing infrastructure and expansion activities, molds, and equipment. Net cash used in investing activities increased $81.7 million for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. This increase was primarily due to the acquisition of NauticStar in October 2017, for cash consideration of $80.5 million, net of cash on hand. Remaining capital outlays consisted of purchases for manufacturing infrastructure and expansion activities, molds, and equipment. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities decreased $2.8 million for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to greater principal repayments on long-term debt in fiscal 2019. Proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, net of principal repayments and debt issuance costs, was $38.0 million and $40.3 million for fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities increased $58.3 million for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to higher proceeds from issuance of long-term debt partially offset by higher principal repayments in fiscal 2018. Proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, net of principal repayments and debt issuance costs, was $40.3 million and ($18.0) million for fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. Senior Secured Credit Facility. On October 1, 2018, the Company entered into a Fourth Amended and Restated Credit and Guaranty Agreement with a syndicate of certain financial institutions (the “Fourth Amended Credit Agreement”). The Fourth Amended Credit Agreement replaced the Company’s Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated October 2, 2017. The Fourth Amended Credit Agreement provides the Company with a $190 million senior secured credit facility, consisting of a $75 million term loan, and an $80 million term loan (together, the “Term Loans”), and a $35 million revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”). Proceeds from the $80 million term loan were used to fund the Crest acquisition. The Term Loans will mature and all remaining amounts outstanding thereunder will be due and payable on October 1, 2023. The Fourth Amended Credit Agreement bears interest, at the Company’s option, at either the prime rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.5% to 1.5% or at an adjusted LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.5% to 2.5%, in each case based on the Company’s senior leverage ratio. Based on the Company’s senior leverage ratio as of June 30, 2019, the applicable margin for loans accruing interest at the prime rate is 0.75% and the applicable margin for loans accruing interest at LIBOR is 1.75%. As of June 30, 2019 and 2018, the effective interest rate on borrowings outstanding was 4.48% and 4.28%, respectively. During the year ended June 30, 2019, the Company made $41.3 million of principal repayments on the Term Loans using cash generated from operations. Of this total, $32.7 million represented voluntary prepayments. As of June 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company’s 38 unamortized debt issuance costs related to the Term Loans were $1.6 million and $1.5 million , respectively. These costs are being amortized over the term of the Fourth Amended Credit Agreement. As of June 30, 2019, the Company had no borrowings outstanding on its Revolving Credit Facility and the availability under the Revolving Credit Facility was $35 million. The Company’s unamortized debt issuance costs related to the Revolving Credit Facility was $0.5 million and $0.4 million as of June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. As of June 30, 2019, the Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants under its Fourth Amended Credit Agreement. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company did not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements as of June 30, 2019. Contractual Obligations As of June 30, 2019, the Company’s contractual cash obligations were as follows: Payments Due by Period Less than More than Total 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years 5 years (Dollars in thousands) Long-Term Debt Obligations (1) $ 115,349 $ 9,167 $ 20,626 $ 85,556 $ — Interest on Long-Term Debt Obligations (2) $ 18,760 $ 5,141 $ 9,019 $ 4,600 $ — Operating Lease Obligations $ 4,631 $ 703 $ 1,318 $ 804 $ 1,806 Purchase Obligations (3) $ 72,270 $ 16,311 $ 36,413 $ 19,546 $ — Other $ 375 $ 180 $ 195 $ — $ — Total Contractual Obligations (4) $ 211,385 $ 31,502 $ 67,571 $ 110,506 $ 1,806 (1) See Note 11 – Long-Term Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Company's debt. “Long-Term Debt Obligations” refers to future cash principal payments. (2) Interest payments on variable rate debt instruments were calculated using June 30, 2019 interest rates and holding them constant for the life of the instruments. (3) Purchase obligations represent agreements with suppliers and vendors entered into as part of the normal course of business. (4) Unrecognized tax benefits of $2.9 million are not reflected in this table because the Company cannot predict when open income tax years will close with completed examinations. See Note 12 – Income Taxes in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Repurchase Obligations — The Company has reserves to cover potential losses associated with repurchase obligations based on historical experience and current facts and circumstances. We incurred no material impact from repurchase events during fiscal 2019, 2018, or 2017. An adverse change in retail sales, however, could require us to repurchase repossessed units upon an event of default by any of our dealers, subject in some cases to an annual limitation. See Note 14 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for more information related to our obligations under our floor plan financing agreements. Emerging Growth Company We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act. For as long as we are an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding stockholder advisory “say-on-pay” votes on executive compensation and stockholder advisory votes on golden parachute compensation. The JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can utilize the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Pursuant to Section 107 of the JOBS Act, we have irrevocably chosen to opt out of such extended transition period and, as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for companies that are not “emerging growth companies.” 39 We will continue to be an emerging growth company until the earliest to occur of (i) the last day of fiscal year during which we had total annual gross revenues of at least $1.07 billion, (ii) June 30, 2021, which is the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of completion of our initial public offering, (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued m ore than $1.07 billion in non-convertible debt, or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a “large accelerated filer,” as defined under the Exchange Act. Inflation The market prices of certain materials and components used in manufacturing our products, especially resins that are made with hydrocarbon feedstocks, copper, aluminum, and stainless steel, can be volatile. Historically, however, inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations. Significant increases in inflation, particularly those related to wages and increases in the cost of raw materials, could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. New boat buyers often finance their purchases. Inflation typically results in higher interest rates that could translate into an increased cost of boat ownership. Should inflation and increased interest rates occur, prospective consumers may choose to forego or delay their purchases or buy a less expensive boat in the event credit is not available to finance their boat purchases. Critical Accounting Policies A “critical accounting policy” is one which is both important to the understanding of our financial condition and results of operations and requires management’s most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results could differ from those estimates and cause our reported net income (loss) to vary significantly from period to period. We believe that the policies listed below involve the greatest degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, we believe these are the most critical to understand in order to evaluate fully our financial condition and results of operations. For additional information regarding these policies, see Note 3 — Significant Accounting Policies in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets — The Company does not amortize goodwill and other purchased intangible assets with indefinite lives. All of the Company’s goodwill and intangible assets relate to either our MasterCraft, NauticStar, or Crest reporting units (see Note 16 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The Company’s intangible assets with finite lives consist primarily of dealer networks and are carried at their estimated fair values at the time of acquisition, less accumulated amortization. Amortization is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets (see Note 8 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Intangible assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment using a process similar to that used to evaluate long-lived assets described below. Goodwill Goodwill results from the excess of purchase price over the net assets of businesses acquired. All three of the Company's reporting units, which are also the Company's reportable segments, have a goodwill balance. The Company reviews goodwill for impairment annually, at fiscal yearend, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit may be below its carrying value. As part of the annual test, the Company may perform a qualitative, rather than quantitative, assessment to determine whether the fair values of its reporting units are “more likely than not” to be greater than their carrying values. In performing this qualitative analysis, the Company considers various factors, including the effect of market or industry changes and the reporting units' actual results compared to projected results. If the fair value of a reporting unit does not meet the ""more likely than not"" criteria discussed above, the impairment test for goodwill is a quantitative test. This test involves comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, goodwill is not considered impaired. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value then the goodwill is considered impaired and an impairment loss is recognized in an amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of the goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. 40 The Company calculates the fair value of its reporting units considering both the in come approach and market approach. The income approach calculates the fair value of the reporting unit using a discounted cash flow approach. Internally forecasted future cash flows, which the Company believes reasonably approximate market participant assu mptions, are discounted using a weighted average cost of capital (“Discount Rate”) developed for each reporting unit. The Discount Rate is developed using market observable inputs, as well as considering whether or not there is a measure of risk related to the specific reporting unit’s forecasted performance. Fair value under the market approach is determined for each unit by applying market multiples for comparable public companies to the unit’s financial results. The key uncertainties in these calculation s are the assumptions used in determining the reporting unit’s forecasted future performance, including revenue growth and operating margins, as well as the perceived risk associated with those forecasts in determining the Discount Rate, along with selecti ng representative market multiples. At June 30 th of each year, we complete our annual impairment test when there are no other triggers during the year. We conducted a quantitative test at June 30, 2019 for all three reporting segments (reporting units), and as a result, recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $28 million related to the NauticStar reporting unit. This charge is included in Goodwill and other intangible asset impairment on the June 30, 2019 consolidated statement of operations. The impairment was principally a result of a decline, in the fiscal fourth quarter, in the outlook for sales and operating performance relative to our acquisition plan. NauticStar’s core segment, the value-brand saltwater fishing boat segment, has experienced a recent slowing in demand, especially for boats less than 24 feet in length, which represent a material percentage of NauticStar’s current model mix. No goodwill impairment charges were recorded for the MasterCraft or Crest reporting units. It is possible that the Company’s assumptions regarding the key uncertainties in these fair value calculations could change in the near term. If actual results differ from the Company’s assumptions regarding the key uncertainties in these fair value calculations, it is possible that one or more of the Company’s reporting units could incur goodwill impairment charges in future periods. Other Intangible Assets The Company's primary intangible assets are dealer networks and trade names acquired in business combinations. Intangible assets are initially valued using a methodology commensurate with the intended use of the asset. The dealer networks were valued using an income approach, which requires an estimate or forecast of the expected future cash flows from the dealer network through the application of the multi-period excess earnings approach. The fair value of trade names is measured using a relief-from-royalty approach, a variation of the income approach, which requires an estimate or forecast of the expected future cash flows. This method assumes the value of the trade name is the discounted cash flows of the amount that would be paid to third parties had the Company not owned the trade name and instead licensed the trade name from another company. The basis for future sales projections for these methods are based on internal revenue forecasts by reporting unit, which the Company believes represent reasonable market participant assumptions. The future cash flows are discounted using an applicable Discount Rate as well as any potential risk premium to reflect the inherent risk of holding a standalone intangible asset. The key uncertainties in these fair value calculations, as applicable, are: assumptions used in developing internal revenue growth and customer expense forecasts, assumed customer attrition rates, the selection of an appropriate royalty rate, as well as the perceived risk associated with those forecasts in determining the Discount Rate. The costs of amortizable intangible assets, including dealer networks, are recognized over their expected useful lives, approximately ten years for the dealer networks, using the straight-line method. Intangible assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment using a process similar to that used to evaluate long-lived assets described below. Intangible assets not subject to amortization are assessed for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that an asset may be impaired. The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset. During the goodwill assessment noted above, we also analyzed indefinite-lived assets, or trade names. As a result of our analysis, we recorded an impairment charge on trade names of $3 million related to the NauticStar reporting unit. This charge was included in Goodwill and other intangible asset impairment on the consolidated statement of operations. No other intangible asset impairment loss was recorded for the MasterCraft or Crest reporting units. Income Taxes— We are subject to income taxes in the United States of America and the United Kingdom. Our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rates, primarily due to changes in the valuation allowance and non-deductible expenses, as further described in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K. Our effective tax rate was 20.2%, 24.5% and 37.5% for the fiscal years ended 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, we cannot provide assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such 41 determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest. Significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. In the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. Realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income in future periods. If future events cause us to conclude that it is not more likely than not that we will be able to recover the value of our deferred tax assets, we are required to establish a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets at that time. Revenue Recognition — The Company’s revenue is derived primarily from the sale of boats, marine parts, and accessories. The Company recognizes revenue when obligations under the terms of a contract are satisfied and control over promised goods is transferred to a customer. For the majority of sales, this occurs when the product is released to the carrier responsible for transporting it to a customer. The Company typically receives payment within 5 days of shipment. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration it expects to receive in exchange for a product. The Company offers discounts and sales incentives that include retail promotions, rebates, and floor plan reimbursement costs that are recorded as reductions of revenues in Net sales in the consolidated statements of operations. The consideration recognized represents the amount specified in a contract with a customer, net of estimated dealer and retail sales incentives the Company reasonably expects to pay. The estimated liability and reduction in revenue for sales incentives is recorded at the time of sale. The Company estimates the amount of sales incentives based on historical data for specific boat models adjusted for forecasted sales volume, product mix, customer behavior and assumptions concerning market conditions. Subsequent adjustments to incentive estimates are possible because actual results may differ from these estimates if market conditions dictate the need to enhance or reduce sales promotion and incentive programs or if dealer achievement or other items vary from historical trends. Dealer Incentives Dealer incentives include seasonal discounts, volume commitment rebates and other allowances. Dealer rebate and sales promotion incentives recorded during the years ended June 30, 2019, 2018, and 2017, were $11.6 million, $6.4 million, and $5.7 million, respectively. Rebates that apply to boats already in dealer inventory are referred to as retail rebates. Retail rebates recorded during the years ended June 30, 2019, 2018, and 2017, were $4.2 million, $1.9 million, and $5.5 million, respectively. Accrued rebates are included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Dealers generally have no rights to return unsold boats. Occasionally, the Company may accept returns in limited circumstances and at the Company’s discretion under its warranty policy (Note 9 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The Company may be obligated, in the event of default by a dealer, to accept returns of unsold boats under its repurchase commitment to floor financing providers, who are able to obtain such boats through foreclosure. The Company accrues the estimated fair value of this obligation based on the age of inventory currently under floor plan financing and estimated credit quality of dealers holding the inventory. Floor Plan Reimbursement Costs The Company participates in various programs whereby it agrees to reimburse its dealers for certain floor plan interest costs incurred by such dealers for limited periods of time, generally ranging up to nine months. Such costs are included as a reduction in net sales in the consolidated statements of operations and totaled $7.5 million, $5.1 million, and $3.7 million for the years ended June 30, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. Shipping and Handling Costs Shipping and handling costs includes those costs incurred to transport product to customers and internal handling costs, which relate to activities to prepare goods for shipment . The Company has elected to account for shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a customer as a fulfillment cost. The Company includes shipping and handling costs, including costs billed to customers, in Cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations. Contract Liabilities A contract liability is created when customers prepay for goods prior to the Company transferring those goods to the customer. The contract liability is reduced once control of the goods is transferred to the customer. The difference between the opening and closing 42 balances of the Company’s contract liabilities primarily results from the timing difference between the Company’s performance and the point at which it receives pre-payment from the customer. Other Revenue Recognition Matters The Company has excluded sales and other taxes assessed by a governmental authority in connection with revenue-producing activities from the determination of the transaction price for all contracts. The Company has not adjusted Net sales for the effects of a significant financing component because the period between the transfer of the promised goods and the customer's payment is expected to be one year or less. Product Warranties — The Company offers warranties on the sale of certain products for periods of between one and five years. These warranties require us or our dealers to repair or replace defective products during the warranty period at no cost to the consumer. We estimate the costs that may be incurred under our basic limited warranty and record as a liability the amount of such costs at the time the product revenue is recognized. The key uncertainties that affect our estimate for warranty liability include anticipated rates of warranty claims and cost per claim. We periodically assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as actual claims are determined or as changes in the obligations become reasonably estimable. Repurchase Agreements — In connection with our dealers’ wholesale floor plan financing of boats, we have entered into repurchase agreements with various lending institutions. The repurchase commitment is on an individual unit basis with a term from the date it is financed by the lending institution through payment date by the dealer, generally not exceeding two and a half years. Such agreements are customary in the industry and our exposure to loss under such agreements is limited by the resale value of the inventory which is required to be repurchased. We incurred no material impact from repurchase events during fiscal 2019, 2018, or 2017. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. Market risk represents the risk of changes in the value of market risk sensitive instruments caused by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, interest rates, and commodity prices. Changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in the results of our operations and cash flows. In the ordinary course of business, we are primarily exposed to interest rate risks. On October 1, 2018, the Company entered into a Fourth Amended and Restated Credit and Guaranty Agreement with a syndicate of certain financial institutions (the “Fourth Amended Credit Agreement”). The Fourth Amended Credit Agreement replaced the Company’s Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated October 2, 2017. The Fourth Amended Credit Agreement provides the Company with a $190 million senior secured credit facility, consisting of a $75 million term loan and an $80 million term loan (together, the “Term Loans”) and a $35 million revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”). Proceeds from the $80 million term loan were used to fund the Crest acquisition. The Term Loans will mature and all remaining amounts outstanding thereunder will be due and payable on October 1, 2023. The Fourth Amended Credit Agreement bears interest, at the Company’s option, at either the prime rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.5% to 1.5% or at an adjusted LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.5% to 2.5%, in each case based on the Company’s senior leverage ratio. Based on the Company’s current senior leverage ratio, the applicable margin for loans accruing interest at the prime rate is 0.75% and the applicable margin for loans accruing interest at LIBOR is 1.75%. As of June 30, 2019 and 2018, the effective interest rate on borrowings outstanding was 4.48% and 4.28%, respectively. A hypothetical 1% increase or decrease in interest rates would have resulted in a $1.2 million change to our interest expense for fiscal 2019. ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA. The financial statements and supplementary financial information required to be filed under this Item 8 are presented in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K and are incorporated herein by reference. ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE. None. 43 ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. As of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-K Annual Report, we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level as of June 30, 2019. Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2019. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (""COSO"") in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) . Based on such assessment our management has concluded that, as of June 30, 2019, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria. Under guidelines established by the SEC, companies are permitted to exclude an acquired business from management’s report on internal control over financial reporting for the first year subsequent to the acquisition while integrating the acquired operations. Accordingly, management has excluded Crest from its annual report on internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2019. Crest represents approximately 35% of the Company’s consolidated total assets as of June 30, 2019, 16% of the Company’s consolidated net sales for the year ended June 30, 2019, and 21% of the Company’s consolidated operating income for the year ended June 30, 2019. See Notes 5 and 16 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. This annual report does not include an attestation report from our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management's report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the SEC that permit emerging growth companies, which we are, to provide only management's report in this annual report. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Excluding the Crest acquisition, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f), during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

LEEMPUTTE Director Peter G. Leemputte September 13, 2019 49 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGIST ERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM Board of Directors and Stockholders MasterCraft Boat Holdings, Inc. Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of MasterCraft Boat Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”) and subsidiaries as of June 30, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity (deficit), and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2019, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company and subsidiaries at June 30, 2019 and 2018, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2019 , in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2015. /s/ BDO USA, LLP Atlanta, Georgia September 13, 2019 F- 1 MASTERCRAFT BOAT HOLDINGS, INC.

F- 5 MASTERCRAFT BOAT HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Dollars in thousands, except per share data and per unit data) 1. ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF BUSINESS MasterCraft Boat Holdings, Inc. (“Holdings”) was formed on January 28, 2000, as a Delaware holding company and operates primarily through its wholly owned subsidiaries, MasterCraft Boat Company, LLC; MasterCraft Services, LLC; MasterCraft Parts, Ltd.; and MasterCraft International Sales Administration, Inc. (collectively “MasterCraft”); Nautic Star, LLC and NS Transport, LLC (collectively “NauticStar”); and Crest Marine, LLC (“Crest”). Holdings and its subsidiaries collectively are referred to herein as the “Company”. On October 2, 2017, the Company acquired all of the outstanding membership interests and other equity securities of NauticStar, a Mississippi limited liability company and its subsidiaries. On October 1, 2018, the Company acquired all of the outstanding membership interest of Crest, a Michigan limited liability company. As a result of the acquisitions, the Company consolidated the financial results of NauticStar and Crest beginning on the respective dates acquired. The Company is a leading innovator, designer, manufacturer and marketer of recreational powerboats that operates in three reportable segments: MasterCraft, NauticStar and Crest. 2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION The accompanying financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Principles of Consolidation — The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Holdings has no independent operations and no material assets, other than its wholly owned equity interests of MasterCraft, NauticStar, and Crest, which totaled $163,013 and $81,160 as of June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and no material liabilities. As of June 30, 2019, Holdings had no material contingencies, long-term obligations, or guarantees other than a guarantee of the Company’s long-term debt (see Note 11). Immaterial Correction of Error — During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company recorded an out of period adjustment that effected the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended June 30, 2018. The adjustment related to improperly projecting warranty claims based on part sales rather than part costs. The impact of this adjustment resulted in an increase in net income of $1,033 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, with a corresponding decrease in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2018. During the second quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company identified two errors in how accrued warranty was calculated that resulted in a net out-of-period adjustment that decreased earnings for the three months ended December 30, 2018 and increased accrued expenses and other current liabilities as of December 30, 2018 by $225. The Company determined that inaccurate data on the cost of parts was used to estimate the warranty liability. The impact of this adjustment resulted in a $1,125 increase in earnings for the three months ended December 30, 2018, with a corresponding decrease in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 30, 2018. The Company also determined that faulty assumptions were used when estimating costs for warranty periods impacted by the change to a five-year warranty. The adjustment resulted in a $1,350 decrease in earnings for the three months ended December 30, 2018, with a corresponding increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 30, 2018. Management evaluated the effect of these adjustments on the Company’s financial statements under the provision of ASC 250: Accounting Changes and Error Corrections and Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108: Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements When Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements and concluded that it was immaterial to the current year and prior years’ annual and quarterly financial statements. Use of Estimates — The preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and related disclosures. The Company bases these estimates on historical results and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable. The Company’s most significant financial statement estimates include allowances for bad debts, warranty liability, dealer incentives liability, self-insurance liability, fair value of share-based compensation, inventory repurchase contingent obligation, unrecognized tax positions, F-6 impairment of long-lived assets and intangible assets subject to amortization, impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles, and potential litigation claims and settlements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Revenue Recognition — The Company’s revenue is derived primarily from the sale of boats, marine parts, and accessories. The Company recognizes revenue when obligations under the terms of a contract are satisfied and control over promised goods is transferred to a customer. For the majority of sales, this occurs when the product is released to the carrier responsible for transporting it to a customer. The Company typically receives payment within 5 days of shipment. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration it expects to receive in exchange for a product. The Company offers discounts and sales incentives that include retail promotions, rebates, and floor plan reimbursement costs that are recorded as reductions of revenues in Net sales in the consolidated statements of operations. The consideration recognized represents the amount specified in a contract with a customer, net of estimated dealer and retail sales incentives the Company reasonably expects to pay. The estimated liability and reduction in revenue for sales incentives is recorded at the time of sale. The Company estimates the amount of sales incentives based on historical data for specific boat models adjusted for forecasted sales volume, product mix, customer behavior and assumptions concerning market conditions. Subsequent adjustments to incentive estimates are possible because actual results may differ from these estimates if market conditions dictate the need to enhance or reduce sales promotion and incentive programs or if dealer achievement or other items vary from historical trends. Dealer Incentives Dealer incentives include seasonal discounts, volume commitment rebates and other allowances. Dealer rebate and sales promotion incentives recorded during the years ended June 30, 2019, 2018, and 2017, were $11,598, $6,361, and $5,660, respectively. Rebates that apply to boats already in dealer inventory are referred to as retail rebates. Retail rebates recorded during the years ended June 30, 2019, 2018, and 2017, were $4,220, $1,932, and $5,484, respectively. Accrued rebates are included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Dealers generally have no rights to return unsold boats. Occasionally, the Company may accept returns in limited circumstances and at the Company’s discretion under its warranty policy (Note 9). The Company may be obligated, in the event of default by a dealer, to accept returns of unsold boats under its repurchase commitment to floor financing providers, who are able to obtain such boats through foreclosure. The Company accrues the estimated fair value of this obligation based on the age of inventory currently under floor plan financing and estimated credit quality of dealers holding the inventory. Floor Plan Reimbursement Costs The Company participates in various programs whereby it agrees to reimburse its dealers for certain floor plan interest costs incurred by such dealers for limited periods of time, generally ranging up to nine months. Such costs are included as a reduction in net sales in the consolidated statements of operations and totaled $7,452, $5,143, and $3,705 for the years ended June 30, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. Shipping and Handling Costs Shipping and handling costs includes those costs incurred to transport product to customers and internal handling costs, which relate to activities to prepare goods for shipment . The Company has elected to account for shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a customer as a fulfillment cost. The Company includes shipping and handling costs, including costs billed to customers, in Cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations. Contract Liabilities A contract liability is created when customers prepay for goods prior to the Company transferring those goods to the customer. The contract liability is reduced once control of the goods is transferred to the customer. The difference between the opening and closing balances of the Company’s contract liabilities primarily results from the timing difference between the Company’s performance and the point at which it receives pre-payment from the customer. Other Revenue Recognition Matters The Company has excluded sales and other taxes assessed by a governmental authority in connection with revenue-producing activities from the determination of the transaction price for all contracts. The Company has not adjusted Net sales for the effects of a significant financing component because the period between the transfer of the promised goods and the customer's payment is expected to be one year or less. F-7 Accounts Receivable — Accounts receivable represents amounts billed to customers under credit terms customary in its industry. The Company normally does not charge interest on its accounts receivable. The Company determines its allowance for doubtful accounts by considering a number of factors, including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due, the Company’s previous loss history, the customer’s current ability to pay its obligation to the Company, and the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole. The Company writes-off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible, and payments subsequently received on such receivables are credited to bad debt recovery. Cash and Cash Equivalents — The Company considers all highly-liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents. The Company’s cash deposits may at times exceed federally insured amounts. The Company had no cash equivalents at June 30, 2019 and 2018. Concentrations of Credit and Business Risk — Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of trade receivables. Credit risk on trade receivables is mitigated as a result of the Company’s use of trade letters of credit, dealer floor plan financing arrangements, and the geographically diversified nature of the Company’s customer base. Supplier Concentrations The Company is dependent on the ability of its suppliers to provide products on a timely basis and on favorable pricing terms. The loss of certain principal suppliers or a significant reduction in product availability from principal suppliers could have a material adverse effect on the Company. Business risk insurance is in place to mitigate the business risk associated with sole suppliers for sudden disruptions such as those caused by natural disasters. The Company is dependent on third-party equipment manufacturers, distributors, and dealers for certain parts and materials utilized in the manufacturing process. In 2019, 2018, and 2017 the Company purchased all engines for its MasterCraft performance sport boats under a supply agreement with a single vendor. Total purchases to this vendor were $39,252, $34,734 and $31,075 for 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. In 2019 and 2018, the Company purchased a majority of engines for its NauticStar boats under a supply agreement with one vendor. Total purchases from this vendor were $23,718 and $19,668 for 2019 and 2018, respectively. In 2019, the Company purchased a majority of the engines for its Crest boats under a supply agreement with a single vendor. Total purchases from this vendor were $20,382 for 2019. Inventories — Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value and are shown net of an inventory allowance in the balance sheet. Inventory cost includes material, labor, and manufacturing overhead and is determined based on the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Provisions are made as necessary to reduce inventory amounts to their net realizable value or to provide for obsolete inventory. Property, Plant, and Equipment — Property, plant, and equipment are recorded at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives. Repairs and maintenance are charged to operations as incurred, and expenditures for additions and improvements that increase the asset’s useful life are capitalized. Ranges of asset lives used for depreciation purposes are: Buildings and improvements 7 - 40 years Machinery and equipment 3 - 7 years Furniture and fixtures 3 - 7 years Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets — The Company does not amortize goodwill and other purchased intangible assets with indefinite lives. All of the Company’s goodwill and intangible assets relate to either our MasterCraft, NauticStar, or Crest reporting units (see Note 16). The Company’s intangible assets with finite lives consist primarily of dealer networks and are carried at their estimated fair values at the time of acquisition, less accumulated amortization. Amortization is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets (see Note 8). Intangible assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment using a process similar to that used to evaluate long-lived assets described below. Goodwill Goodwill results from the excess of purchase price over the net identifiable assets of businesses acquired. All three of the Company's reporting units, which are also the Company's reportable segments, have a goodwill balance. F-8 The Company reviews goodwill for impairment annually , at fiscal yearend, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fai r value of a reporting unit may be below its carrying value. As part of the annual test, the Company may perform a qualitative, rather than quantitative, assessment to determine whether the fair values of its reporting units are “more likely than not” to b e greater than their carrying values. In performing this qualitative analysis, the Company considers various factors, including the effect of market or industry changes and the reporting units' actual results compared to projected results. If the fair value of a reporting unit does not meet the ""more likely than not"" criteria discussed above, the impairment test for goodwill is a quantitative test. This test involves comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, goodwill is not considered impaired. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value then the goodwill is considered impaired and an impairment loss is recognized in an amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of the goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The Company calculates the fair value of its reporting units by considering both the income approach and market approach. The income approach calculates the fair value of the reporting unit using a discounted cash flow method. Internally forecasted future cash flows, which the Company believes reasonably approximate market participant assumptions, are discounted using a weighted average cost of capital (“Discount Rate”) developed for each reporting unit. The Discount Rate is developed using observable market inputs, as well as considering whether or not there is a measure of risk related to the specific reporting unit’s forecasted performance. Fair value under the market approach is determined for each unit by applying market multiples for comparable public companies to the unit’s financial results. The key uncertainties in these calculations are the assumptions used in determining the reporting unit’s forecasted future performance, including revenue growth and operating margins, as well as the perceived risk associated with those forecasts in determining the Discount Rate, along with selecting representative market multiples. For the year ended June 30, 2019, the Company performed a quantitative test for all three reporting units and determined that the goodwill allocated to the NauticStar reporting unit was impaired. The Company recognized an associated goodwill impairment charge of $28,000 in its statement of operations for the year ended June 30, 2019 (see Note 8). The Company recognized no goodwill impairment for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017. Other Intangible Assets The Company's primary intangible assets are dealer networks and trade names acquired in business combinations. Intangible assets are initially valued using a methodology commensurate with the intended use of the asset. The dealer networks were valued using an income approach, which requires an estimate or forecast of the expected future cash flows from the dealer network through the application of the multi-period excess earnings approach. The fair value of trade names is measured using a relief-from-royalty approach, a variation of the income approach, which requires an estimate or forecast of the expected future cash flows. This method assumes the value of the trade name is the discounted cash flows of the amount that would be paid to third parties had the Company not owned the trade name and instead licensed the trade name from another company. The basis for future sales projections for these methods are based on internal revenue forecasts by reporting unit, which the Company believes represent reasonable market participant assumptions. The future cash flows are discounted using an applicable Discount Rate as well as any potential risk premium to reflect the inherent risk of holding a standalone intangible asset. The key uncertainties in these fair value calculations, as applicable, are: assumptions used in developing internal revenue growth and customer expense forecasts, assumed customer attrition rates, the selection of an appropriate royalty rate, as well as the perceived risk associated with those forecasts in determining the Discount Rate. The costs of amortizable intangible assets, including dealer networks, are recognized over their expected useful lives, approximately ten years for the dealer networks, using the straight-line method. Intangible assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment using a process similar to that used to evaluate long-lived assets described below. Intangible assets not subject to amortization are assessed for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that an asset may be impaired. The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset. For the year ended June 30, 2019, the Company recognized a $3,000 impairment charge related to the NauticStar trade name (see Note 8). The Company recognized no impairments related to other intangible assets for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017. Long-Lived Assets Other than Intangible Assets — The Company assesses the potential for impairment of its long-lived assets if facts and circumstances, such as declines in sales, earnings, or cash flows or adverse changes in the business climate, suggest that they may be impaired. The Company performs its review by comparing the book value of the assets to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows F-9 associated with the assets. If any impairme nt in the carrying value of its long-lived assets is indicated, the assets would be adjusted to an estimate of fair value. Income Taxes — Income tax expense is the total of the current year income tax due or refundable and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Company records its global tax provision based on the respective tax rules and regulations for the jurisdictions in which it operates. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are the expected future tax amounts for the temporary differences between carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities, computed using enacted tax rates. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. Significant judgment is required in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets. The realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income. A tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is “more likely than not” that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the “more likely than not” test, no tax benefit is recorded. The Company recognizes interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. In determining the amount of current and deferred tax the Company takes into account the impact of uncertain tax positions and whether additional taxes, interest and penalties may be due. The Company believes that its accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open tax years based on its assessment of many factors, including interpretations of tax law and prior experience. This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of judgments about future events. New information may become available that causes the Company to change its judgment regarding the adequacy of existing tax liabilities; such changes to tax liabilities will have an impact on tax expense in the period that such a determination is made. The income tax effects of the differences we identify are classified as long-term deferred tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Product Warranties — The Company offers warranties on the sale of certain products for periods of between one and five years. These warranties require us or our dealers to repair or replace defective products during the warranty period at no cost to the consumer. We estimate the costs that may be incurred under our basic limited warranty and record as a liability the amount of such costs at the time the product revenue is recognized. Factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of units sold, historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims, and cost per claim. We periodically assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as actual claims are determined or as changes in the obligations become reasonably estimable. Research and Development — Research and development expenditures are expensed as incurred. Research and development expense for the years ended June 30, 2019, 2018, and 2017 was $5,566, $4,933, and $3,550, respectively, and is included in operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. Self-Insurance — The Company is self-insured for certain losses relating to product liability claims and employee medical claims. The Company has purchased stop-loss coverage in order to limit its exposure to any significant levels under these plans. Losses are accrued based on the Company’s estimates of the aggregate liability for self-insured claims incurred using certain actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and the Company’s historical experience. Deferred Debt Issuance Costs — Certain costs incurred to obtain financing are capitalized and amortized over the term of the related debt using the effective interest method. For the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 the Company incurred deferred financing costs of $729 and $1,240, respectively. For the year ended June 30, 2017 the Company did not incur any deferred financing costs. For the years ended June 30, 2019, 2018, and 2017 the Company recorded amortization of $553, $496, and $361, respectively. Share-Based Compensation — The Company records amounts for all share-based compensation, including grants of restricted stock awards, performance stock units, and nonqualified stock options over the vesting period in the consolidated statements of operations based on their fair values at the date of the grant. Forfeitures of share-based compensation, if any, are recognized as they occur. Share-based compensation costs are included in Selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of Operations. See Note 13 – Share-Based Compensation for a description of the Company's accounting for share-based compensation plans. Advertising — Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense recognized during the years ended June 30, 2019, 2018, and 2017, was $9,347, $6,787, and $5,201, respectively, and is included in selling and marketing expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. F-10 Fair Value Measurements — The Company measures its financial assets and liabilities and utilizes the established framework for measuring fair valu e and disclosing information about fair value measurements. Fair value is the price expected to be received to transfer an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Measuring fair v alue involves a hierarchy of valuation inputs. This hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three levels as follows: Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for sim ilar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and, Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring a company to d evelop its own valuation assumptions. Fair Value of Financial Instruments — The carrying amounts of the Company’s financial instruments, consisting of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and other liabilities, approximate their estimated fair values due to the relative short-term nature of the amounts. The carrying amount of debt approximates fair value due to variable interest rates at customary terms and rates the Company could obtain in current financing. Repurchase Commitments — In connection with its dealers’ wholesale floor-plan financing of boats, the Company has entered into repurchase agreements with various lending institutions. The repurchase commitment is on an individual unit basis with a term from the date it is financed by the lending institution through the payment date by the dealer, generally not exceeding 30 months. The Company accounts for these arrangements as guarantees and recognizes a liability based on the estimated fair value of the repurchase obligation. The estimated fair value takes into account our estimate of the loss we will incur upon resale of any repurchases. The Company has applied these provisions to its floor plan repurchase agreements as disclosed in Notes 9 and 14. Earnings Per Common Share — Basic earnings per common share reflects reported earnings divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted earnings per common share include the effect of dilutive stock options and restricted share awards, unless inclusion would not be dilutive. Operating Leases — The Company leases its Crest production facility and various equipment under operating lease arrangements. Lease agreements may include rent holidays, rent escalation clauses, and tenant improvement allowances. The Company recognizes scheduled rent increases on a straight-line basis over the lease term beginning with the date the Company takes possession of the leased property. Postretirement Benefits – The Company has a defined contribution plan and makes contributions including matching and discretionary contributions which are based on various percentages of compensation, and in some instances are based on the amount of the employees' contributions to the plans. The expense related to the defined contribution plans was $1,208, $826, and $640 for the years ended June 30, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. Comparability between these years has been affected, primarily, by the acquisition of Crest and NauticStar during the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively (See Note 5). Segment Information — Operating segments are identified as components of an enterprise about which discrete financial information is available for evaluation by the chief operating decision maker in making decisions on how to allocate resources and assess performance. The Company views its operations in three operating segments based on its operation and management structure: MasterCraft, NauticStar, and Crest (see Note 16). New Accounting Pronouncements Issued But Not Yet Adopted In June 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued ASU 2018-07 , Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting . This guidance provides clarity and reduces complexity when applying the guidance in Topic 718, Compensation—Stock Compensation to the term or condition of share-based payments to nonemployees. ASU 2018-07 is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods therein, beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company will adopt this guidance for its fiscal year beginning July 1, 2019. The Company does not expect adoption of this standard to have a material impact on its financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) . The new standard establishes a right-of-use (“ROU”) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the statement of operations. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-11, Targeted Improvements , providing for an additional transition method by allowing entities to initially apply the new leases standard at the adoption date and recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. The Company will adopt the new standard on July 1, 2019 and use the effective date as the date of initial application. F-11 The new standard provides a number of optional practical expedients in transition. The Company expects to elect the ‘package of practical expedients’, which permits it not to reassess under the new standard the Company’s prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification, and initial direct costs. The Company does not expect to elect the use-of-hindsight or the practical expedient pertaining to land easements; the latter not being applicable to the Company. The Company expects that the most significant effects relate to the recognition of the new ROU assets and lease liabilities on the Company’s balance s heet for its building and equipment operating leases and providing significant new disclosures about its leasing activities. The Company anticipates the adoption of the standard will result in the recognition of approximately $4 ,000 in right-of-use assets and associated lease obligations on the consolidated balance sheets and will not materially impact results on the consolidated statements of operations. New Accounting Pronouncements Issued And Adopted In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) , which provides principle-based accounting guidance for revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09, as amended, became effective for public companies for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Effective July 1, 2018, the Company adopted the new revenue standard using the modified retrospective transition approach by recognizing a cumulative adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. Due to the implementation of ASU 2014-09, the Company has changed the timing of when it records retail promotions and rebates. The cumulative effect of the changes made to the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as of July 1, 2018 for the adoption of the new revenue standard was as follows: Balance as of Adjustments Balance as of June 30, 2018 Due to ASC 606 July 1, 2018 Accrued expenses and other current liabilities $ 27,866 $ 4,029 $ 31,895 Deferred income taxes 1,427 (938 ) 489 Accumulated deficit (61,717 ) (3,091 ) (64,808 ) The following table summarizes the impact of ASU 2014-09 on the Company’s consolidated statement of operations for the year ended June 30, 2019: Balances without Statement of Operations As Reported Effect of Change adoption of ASC 606 Net sales $ 466,381 $ 42 $ 466,423 Income before income tax expense 26,746 42 26,788 Income tax expense 5,392 8 5,400 Net income 21,354 34 21,388 The following table summarizes the impact of ASU 2014-09 on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2019: Balances without Balance Sheet As Reported Effect of Change adoption of ASC 606 Accrued expenses and other current liabilities $ 41,421 $ (4,071 ) $ 37,350 Income taxes 3,870 946 4,816 Accumulated deficit (43,454 ) 3,125 (40,329 ) In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments . ASU 2016-15 addresses how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows under Topic 230, Statement of Cash Flow , and other Topics. ASU 2016-15 is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods therein, beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company adopted this standard for its fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. F-12 In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04 , Intangibles—Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. This guidance eliminates Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Instead, an entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allo cated to that reporting unit. ASU 2017-04 is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods therein, beginning after December 15, 2019 . Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates afte r January 1, 2017. The Company early adopted this standard for its annual goodwill impairment tests performed on June 30, 2019. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or ca sh flows . 4. REVENUE RECOGNITION The following table presents the Company’s revenue by major product categories for the year ended June 30, 2019: MasterCraft NauticStar Crest Total Major Product Categories Boats and trailers $ 301,010 $ 77,896 $ 75,742 $ 454,648 Parts 9,471 85 498 10,054 Other revenue 1,349 14 316 1,679 Total $ 311,830 $ 77,995 $ 76,556 $ 466,381 As of July 1, 2018, the Company had $2,194 of contract liabilities associated with customer deposits. During the year ended June 30, 2019, all of this amount was recognized as revenue. As of June 30, 2019, total contract liabilities were $759 and were reported in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet and are expected to be recognized as revenue during the year ended June 30, 2020. See Note 3 for a description of the Company’s significant revenue recognition policies. 5. ACQUISITIONS Crest Acquisition On October 1, 2018, the Company completed its acquisition of Crest, a manufacturer of pontoon boats. With the acquisition of Crest, the Company expanded its product portfolio and now operates in three segments of the powerboat industry – performance sport boats, outboard saltwater fishing boats and pontoon boats. The purchase price was $81,729, including customary adjustments for working capital in the acquired business at the closing date. For accounting purposes, Crest meets the definition of a business and has been accounted for as a business combination. Beginning October 1, 2018, our consolidated statement of operations include the results of Crest. Since the date of acquisition, net sales of $76,556 and operating income of $7,055 have been included in our consolidated statement of operations. The total consideration paid has been allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values as of the date of acquisition. Amounts recorded for goodwill and intangible assets are disclosed in Note 8. The measurements of fair value were based on estimates utilizing the assistance of third-party valuation specialists. A combination of income, market and cost approaches were used for the valuation where appropriate, depending on the asset or liability being valued. Valuation inputs in these models and analyses considered market participant assumptions. F-13 Management finalized the valuation related to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed , and t he following table summarizes the purchase price allocation for the Crest acquisition : Purchase Price: Cash paid, net of cash acquired $ 81,729 Recognized amounts of identifiable assets acquired and (liabilities assumed), at fair value: Accounts receivable $ 5,215 Inventories 9,853 Other current assets 179 Property, plant and equipment 1,840 Identifiable intangible assets 35,245 Current liabilities (6,841 ) Fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 45,491 Goodwill 36,238 $ 81,729 The following table summarizes the intangible assets acquired as part of the acquisition: Estimates of Fair Value Estimated Useful Life (in years) Definite-lived intangible assets: Dealer network $ 18,000 10 Software 245 5 Indefinite-lived intangible asset: Trade name 17,000 Total identifiable intangible assets $ 35,245 The value allocated to inventories was based on the expected sales price of the inventory, less an estimated cost to complete and a reasonable profit margin. The value allocated to accounts receivable represents expected collection of those receivables. The fair value of the identifiable intangible assets was determined based on the following approaches: • Dealer Network – The value associated with Crest’s dealer network is attributed to its long-standing dealer relationships. The estimate of fair value assigned to this asset was determined using the income approach, which requires an estimate or forecast of the expected future cash flows from the dealer network through the application of the multi-period excess earnings approach. • Software – The value attributed to Crest’s software was determined using the replacement cost method, a variation of cost approach, which requires an estimate of the replacement cost and incorporates an obsolescence factor and a developer’s profit margin. • Trade Name – The value attributed to Crest’s trade name was determined using the relief from royalty method, a variation of the income approach, which requires an estimate or forecast of the expected future cash flows. The trade name has an indefinite life. The fair value of the definite-lived intangible assets are being amortized using the straight-line method to recognize the expense over the estimated useful life. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but instead are evaluated for potential impairment on an annual basis . The weighted average useful life of identifiable definite-lived intangible assets acquired was 9.9 years. Goodwill of $36,238 resulting from the acquisition consists of future growth prospects including dealer expansion into new geographic markets and capacity expansion as well as intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition. The indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill acquired are expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. The value allocated to property, plant and equipment reflects the fair value of the acquired property, plant and equipment using a combination of the income, cost, and market approaches, which are primarily based on significant Level 2 and Level 3 assumptions, such as estimates of absorption period, lease-up costs, market rent, operating expenses, and terminal capitalization and discount rates. F-14 A cquisition related costs of $ 1,510, which were incurred by the Company during the fiscal year-ended June 30 , 2019, were expensed in the period incurred, and are included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations. Crest Related Party Transactions Effective October 1, 2018, in connection with the purchase of Crest, the Company entered into a lease agreement with Crest Marine Real Estate LLC (“Real Estate”) for a manufacturing facility, storage and office building. The ten-year lease expires September 30, 2028, subject to four consecutive five year extension periods. The annual rent is $330 for the first five years of the lease term and will increase to $425 for the remaining five years. Additionally, during the option terms the rent will be adjusted every five years based on the increase in the Consumer Price Index. One of the minority owners of Real Estate is a member of the Crest management team. During the year ended June 30, 2019, the Company recognized related rent expense of $248. Crest purchases fiberglass component parts from a supplier whose minority owner is the same member of the Crest management team that has a minority ownership in Real Estate. During year ended June 30, 2019, the Company purchased $2,830 of products from the supplier. As of June 30, 2019, the outstanding balance due to the supplier was $146. NauticStar Acquisition On October 2, 2017, the Company completed its acquisition of NauticStar which adds to its product diversity. The purchase price was $80,511, including customary adjustments for the amount of working capital in the acquired business at the closing date. The Company accounted for the transaction using the acquisition method. The total consideration has been allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimates of their fair values as of the date of acquisition. The Company has recorded the goodwill and intangible assets acquired based on their fair values as of October 2, 2017. The measurements of fair value were based upon estimates utilizing the assistance of third-party valuation specialists. The following table summarizes the purchase price allocation based on the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed of NauticStar at the acquisition date: Purchase Price: Cash paid, net of cash acquired $ 80,511 Recognized amounts of identifiable assets acquired and (liabilities assumed), at fair value: Accounts receivable $ 1,773 Inventories 6,358 Other current assets 94 Indemnification asset 166 Deferred income taxes 83 Property, plant and equipment 4,945 Identifiable intangible assets 36,000 Current liabilities (4,858 ) Unrecognized tax positions (249 ) Fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 44,312 Goodwill 36,199 $ 80,511 The fair value estimates for the Company’s identifiable intangible assets acquired as part of the acquisition are as follows: Estimates of Fair Value Estimated Useful Life (in years) Definite-lived intangible: Dealer network $ 20,000 10 Indefinite-lived intangible: Trade name 16,000 Total identifiable intangible assets $ 36,000 F-15 The value allocated to inventories reflects the fair value of the acquired inventory based on the sales price of the inventory, less cost to complete and a reasonable profit margin. The value allocated to accounts receivable represents the fair value of the acquired receivables based on the expected collection of those receivables. The fair value of the identifiable intangible assets was determined based on the following approaches: • Dealer Network - The value associated with NauticStar’s dealer network is attributed to its long-standing dealer distribution network. The estimate of fair value assigned to this asset was determined using the income approach, which requires an estimate or forecast of the expected future cash flows from the dealer network through the application of the multi-period excess earnings approach. • Trade Name - The value attributed to NauticStar’s trade name was determined using the relief from royalty method, a variation of the income approach, which requires an estimate or forecast of the expected future cash flows. The trade name has an indefinite life. The fair value of the definite-lived intangible asset is being amortized using the straight-line method to amortization of intangible assets expense over the estimated useful life. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but instead are evaluated for potential impairment on an annual basis. The weighted average useful life of identifiable definite-lived intangible assets acquired was 10 years. Goodwill of $36,199 resulting from the acquisition consists of future growth prospects including dealer expansion into new geographic markets and capacity expansion as well as intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition such as an assembled workforce. The indefinite-lived intangible asset and goodwill acquired are expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. The value allocated to property, plant and equipment reflects the fair value of the acquired property, plant and equipment using a combination of the income, cost, and market approaches, which are primarily based on significant Level 2 and Level 3 assumptions, such as estimates of absorption period, lease-up costs, market rent, operating expenses, and terminal capitalization and discount rates. Acquisition related costs of $1,486, which were incurred by the Company during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, were expensed during the period, and are included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations. Pro Forma Financial Information The following unaudited pro forma consolidated results of operations for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017, assumes that the acquisition of NauticStar occurred as of July 1, 2017, and the acquisition of Crest occurred as of July 1, 2018. The unaudited pro forma financial information combines historical results of MasterCraft, NauticStar, and Crest with adjustments for depreciation and amortization attributable to preliminary fair value estimates on acquired tangible and intangible assets for the respective periods. Non-recurring pro forma adjustments associated with the fair value step up of inventory were included in the reported pro forma cost of sales and earnings. The unaudited pro forma financial information is presented for informational purposes only and is not indicative of the results of operations that would have been achieved if the acquisitions had taken place at the beginning of fiscal years 2018 and 2017, or the results that may occur in the future: Fiscal Years Ended 2019 2018 2017 Net sales $ 487,374 $ 423,630 $ 305,705 Net income $ 21,619 $ 38,269 $ 20,919 Basic earnings per common share $ 1.16 $ 2.06 $ 1.13 Diluted earnings per common share $ 1.15 $ 2.04 $ 1.12 6. INVENTORIES Inventories at June 30, 2019 and 2018 consisted of the following: 2019 2018 Raw materials and supplies $ 20,034 $ 9,587 Work in process 4,571 2,822 Finished goods 7,207 9,026 Obsolescence reserve (1,152 ) (968 ) Total inventories $ 30,660 $ 20,467 F-16 7. PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT Property, plant, and equipment — net at June 30, 2019 and 2018, consisted of the following: 2019 2018 Land and improvements $ 1,901 $ 1,725 Buildings and improvements 15,652 11,960 Machinery and equipment 29,804 22,570 Furniture and fixtures 1,719 943 Construction in progress 4,866 3,564 Total property, plant, and equipment 53,942 40,762 Less accumulated depreciation (20,306 ) (18,497 ) Property, plant, and equipment — net $ 33,636 $ 22,265 Depreciation expense for the years ended June 30, 2019, 2018, and 2017 was $4,295, $3,489, and $3,124, respectively. 8. GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS Goodwill The following table summarizes changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018. MasterCraft NauticStar Crest Total Balance as of June 30, 2017 $ 29,593 $ — $ — $ 29,593 Goodwill acquired — 36,199 — 36,199 Balance as of June 30, 2018 29,593 36,199 — 65,792 Goodwill acquired — — 36,238 36,238 Impairment charges — (28,000 ) — (28,000 ) Balance as of June 30, 2019 $ 29,593 $ 8,199 $ 36,238 $ 74,030 Goodwill acquired during the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 are related to the acquisitions as described in Note 5 and are derived from the value of the businesses acquired. The acquisitions represented operating segments added to our reporting structure and the related goodwill was assigned accordingly. For the purpose of goodwill impairment testing, the operating segments (MasterCraft, NauticStar and Crest) are considered reporting units and are tested on a stand-alone basis. We performed our annual goodwill analysis as of June 30, 2019 and elected to early adopt ASU 2017-14 (See Note 3). The goodwill impairment analysis required significant judgements to calculate the fair value for each reporting unit, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of long-term growth rate for each reporting unit, and determination of the weighted average cost of capital. A number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the discounted cash flow model to forecast operating cash flows, including market growth and market share, sales volumes and prices, costs to produce, discount rate, and estimated capital needs. Management considers historical experience and all available information at the time that the fair values of its reporting units are estimated. Assumptions in estimating future cash flows are subject to a high degree of judgment and complexity. Changes in assumptions and estimates may affect the fair value of goodwill and could result in impairment charges in future periods. As a result of our analysis, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $28,000 related to the NauticStar reporting unit. The impairment was principally a result of a decline, in the fiscal fourth quarter, in the outlook for sales and operating performance relative to our acquisition plan. This charge is included in Goodwill and other intangible asset impairment on the June 30, 2019 consolidated statement of operations. No goodwill impairment charges were recorded for the MasterCraft or Crest reporting units. It is possible that t he Company’s assumptions regarding the key uncertainties in these fair value calculations could change in the near term. If actual results differ from the Company’s assumptions regarding the key uncertainties in these fair value calculations, it is possible that one or more of the Company’s reporting units could incur goodwill impairment charges in future periods. NauticStar goodwill as of June 30, 2019 was $8,199. If our assessment of the relevant facts and circumstances change, or if the actual performance falls short of expected results, future impairment charges may be required. An impairment of goodwill may also lead us to record an impairment of other intangible assets. We completed our annual goodwill impairment review during the fiscal fourth quarters of 2018 and 2017 and concluded that there were no indicators of goodwill impairment during those periods. F-17 Other Intangible Assets We have identified intangible assets with definite and indefinite lives primarily representing dealer networks, software and trade names. In fiscal 2019 and 2018, the acquisition of Crest added $35,245 and the acquisition of NauticStar added $36,000 of intangible assets respectively. The intangible assets acquired primarily represent trade names and dealer networks with a weighted average estimated useful life of the acquired assets of 10 years. Refer to Note 5 for further discussion regarding the 2019 and 2018 acquisitions. The following table presents changes in the carrying amount of other intangible assets, net. MasterCraft NauticStar Crest Total Balance as of June 30, 2017 $ 16,643 $ — $ — $ 16,643 Amortization (107 ) (1,490 ) — (1,597 ) Intangible assets acquired — 36,000 — 36,000 Balance as of June 30, 2018 $ 16,536 $ 34,510 $ — $ 51,046 Amortization (107 ) (1,998 ) (1,387 ) (3,492 ) Intangible assets acquired — — 35,245 35,245 Impairment charges — (3,000 ) — (3,000 ) Total other intangible assets $ 16,429 $ 29,512 $ 33,858 $ 79,799 The following table presents the cost and accumulated amortization of our other intangible assets as of June 30, 2019 and 2018. June 30, 2019 Estimated Gross Useful Carrying Accumulated Net Carrying Life in Years Amount Amortization Impairment Value Dealer network 10 -14 $ 39,500 $ (5,909 ) $ — $ 33,591 Software 5 245 (37 ) — 208 Trade names Indefinite 49,000 — (3,000 ) 46,000 Total identified other intangible assets $ 88,745 $ (5,946 ) $ (3,000 ) $ 79,799 June 30, 2018 Estimated Gross Useful Carrying Accumulated Net Carrying Life in Years Amount Amortization Impairment Value Dealer network 10 -14 $ 21,500 $ (2,454 ) $ — $ 19,046 Trade names Indefinite 32,000 — — 32,000 Total identified other intangible assets $ 53,500 $ (2,454 ) $ — $ 51,046 Intangible assets that become fully amortized are removed from the accounts and are no longer represented in the gross carrying value or accumulated amortization. The trade names have been determined to have indefinite lives and are not being amortized, based on management’s expectation that trade names will generate cash flows for an indefinite period. Management expects to maintain usage of the trade names on existing products and introduce new products in the future under the trade names, thus extending their lives indefinitely. During our annual assessment of indefinite-lived intangibles, trade names, the Company recorded an impairment charge on trade names of $3,000 related to the NauticStar reporting unit. The impairment was principally a result of a decline, in the fiscal fourth quarter, in the outlook for sales and operating performance relative to our acquisition plan. This charge was included in Goodwill and other intangible asset impairment on the consolidated statement of operations. No other intangible asset impairment loss was recorded for the MasterCraft or Crest reporting units. F-18 Amortization expense fo r the fiscal years ended June 30, 201 9 , 201 8 , and 201 7 , was $ 3,492 , $ 1,597 and $ 107 , respectively. Estimated amortization expense for the five years subsequent to June 30, 201 9 , is presented in the following table: Fiscal years ending June 30, 2020 $ 3,956 2021 3,956 2022 3,956 2023 3,956 2024 3,815 and thereafter 14,160 Total $ 33,799 9. ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES Accrued expenses and other current liabilities at June 30, 2019 and 2018, consisted of the following: 2019 2018 Warranty $ 17,205 $ 13,077 Dealer incentives 12,623 4,628 Compensation and related accruals 3,494 2,997 Floor plan interest 2,060 1,228 Inventory repurchase contingent obligation 1,936 1,265 Self-insurance 606 703 Debt interest 405 244 Other 3,092 3,724 Total accrued expenses and other current liabilities $ 41,421 $ 27,866 The following table summarizes the activity in the accrued warranty liability for the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018: 2019 2018 Beginning balance $ 13,077 $ 12,237 Additions for business acquisitions 990 945 Provisions 8,056 6,523 Payments made (7,198 ) (4,427 ) Adjustments to preexisting warranties 2,280 (2,201 ) Ending balance $ 17,205 $ 13,077 10. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS Fair value is the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair values: Level 1 — Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity has the ability to access as of the measurement date. Level 2 — Significant other observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. Level 3 — Significant unobservable inputs that reflect a company’s own assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. When determining the fair value measurements for assets or liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at and/or marked to fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. When possible, the Company looks to active and observable markets to F-19 price identical assets. When identical assets are not traded in active markets, the Company looks to market observable data for similar assets. Fair Value Measurements on a Recurring Basis The following tables summarize the Company’s financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of June 30, 2019 and 2018: 2019 Fair Measurements at the End of the Reporting Period Using Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Asset — interest rate cap $ — $ 50 $ — 2018 Fair Measurements at the End of the Reporting Period Using Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Asset — interest rate cap $ — $ 525 $ — Interest Rate Cap In November 2017, the Company entered into an interest rate cap agreement (“Interest Rate Cap”) with a certain financial institution. The Interest Rate Cap provides for the Company to receive monthly payments based on (i) an amortizing notional amount and (ii) the amount by which the one-month London Inter-Bank Offered Rate exceeds 2.00%. The notional amount as of June 30, 2019 was $32,813. The Interest Rate Cap will terminate on December 31, 2020. The Interest Rate Cap is valued utilizing pricing models which use inputs such as interest rate forecasts and notional amounts. Fair value measurements for the Company’s Interest Rate Cap are classified under Level 2 because such measurements are based on significant other observable inputs. There were no transfers of assets or liabilities between Level 1 and Level 2 during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019. Fair Value Measurements on a Nonrecurring Basis NauticStar Goodwill — The Company performed its annual goodwill analysis as of June 30, 2019. As a result, the fair value of goodwill attributable to the NauticStar reporting unit was estimated to be $8,199 as of June 30, 2019. Inputs used to estimate this fair value include significant unobservable inputs that reflect the Company’s own assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use and, therefore, goodwill attributable to the NauticStar reporting unit is classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. NauticStar Trade Name — During the goodwill assessment noted above, the Company also analyzed indefinite-lived assets, or trade names. As a result, the fair value of the NauticStar trade name was estimated to be $13,000 as of June 30, 2019. Inputs used to estimate this fair value include significant unobservable inputs that reflect the Company’s own assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use and, therefore, the NauticStar trade name is classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. See Note 8 for a description of the valuation techniques and inputs used in the fair value measurement of goodwill attributable to the NauticStar reporting unit and the NauticStar trade name. F-20 11. LONG-TERM DEBT Long-term debt outstanding at June 30, 2019 and 2018 was as follows: 2019 2018 Revolving credit facility $ — $ — Senior secured term loans 115,349 76,656 Deferred debt issuance costs on term loans (1,608 ) (1,500 ) Total debt 113,741 75,156 Less current portion of long-term debt 9,167 5,475 Less current portion of deferred debt issuance costs on term loans (442 ) (406 ) Long-term debt — less current portion $ 105,016 $ 70,087 Previously Existing Credit Facilities In May 2016, the Company entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit and Guaranty Agreement with a syndicate of certain financial institutions (the “Prior Credit Agreement”). The Prior Credit Agreement replaced the Company’s First Amended Credit Agreement, dated March 13, 2015 (as amended in February 2016). The Prior Credit Agreement provided the Company with an $80,000 senior secured credit facility, consisting of a $50,000 term loan and a $30,000 revolving credit facility. The Company used the proceeds to pay a $79,945 cash dividend to common stockholders in June 2016. The cash dividend payment per share was $4.30 based on shares outstanding as of June 6, 2016. On October 2, 2017, the Company entered into a Third Amended and Restated Credit and Guaranty Agreement with a syndicate of certain financial institutions (the “Third Amended Credit Agreement”). The Third Amended Credit Agreement replaced and paid off the Company’s Prior Credit Agreement, dated May 27, 2016. The Third Amended Credit Agreement provided the Company with a $145,000 senior secured credit facility, consisting of a $115,000 term loan (the “Third Term Loan”) and a $30,000 revolving credit facility. A portion of the proceeds from the Third Amended Credit Agreement were used for the Company’s acquisition of NauticStar. The Third Amended Credit Agreement bore interest, at the Company’s option, at either the prime rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.75% to 1.75% or at an adjusted LIBOR plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.75% to 2.75%, in each case based on the Company’s senior leverage ratio. Based on the Company’s senior leverage ratio for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, the applicable margin for loans accruing interest at the prime rate was 1.0% and the applicable margin for loans accruing interest at LIBOR was 2.0%. In connection with the Third Amended Credit Agreement, the Company paid $1,240 of deferred debt issuance costs during the year ended June 30, 2018. Current Credit Facility On October 1, 2018, the Company entered into a Fourth Amended and Restated Credit and Guaranty Agreement with a syndicate of certain financial institutions (the “Fourth Amended Credit Agreement”). The Fourth Amended Credit Agreement replaced the Company’s Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated October 2, 2017. The Fourth Amended Credit Agreement provides the Company with a $190,000 senior secured credit facility, consisting of a $75,000 term loan, and an $80,000 term loan (together, the “Term Loans”), and a $35,000 revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”). Proceeds from the $80,000 term loan were used to fund the Crest acquisition. The Fourth Amended Credit Agreement is secured by substantially all the assets of the Company. Holdings is a guarantor on the Fourth Amended Credit Agreement and the Fourth Amended Credit Agreement contains covenants that restrict the ability of Holdings’ subsidiaries to make distributions to Holdings. The Term Loans will mature and all remaining amounts outstanding thereunder will be due and payable on October 1, 2023. In connection with the Fourth Amended Credit Agreement, the Company paid $729 of deferred debt issuance costs during the year ended June 30, 2019. Maturities for the Term Loans subsequent to June 30, 2019 are as follows: Fiscal years ending June 30, 2020 $ 9,167 2021 9,167 2022 11,459 2023 12,222 2024 73,334 Total $ 115,349 F-21 The Fourth Amended Credit Agreement bears interest, at the Company’s option, at either the prime rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.5% to 1.5% or at an adjusted LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.5% to 2.5%, in each case based o n the Company’s senior leverage ratio. Based on the Company’s senior leverage ratio as of June 30, 2019 , the applicable margin for loans accruing interest at the prime rate is 0.75 % and the applicable margin for loans accruing interest at LIBOR is 1.75 %. As of June 30, 2019 and 2018, the effective interest rate on borrowings outstanding was 4.48% and 4.28%, respectively. During the year ended June 30, 2019, the Company made voluntary prepayments on the Term Loans of $32,660, using cash generated from operations. As of June 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company’s unamortized debt issuance costs related to the Term Loans were $1,608 and $1,500, respectively. These costs are being amortized over the term of the Fourth Amended Credit Agreement. As of June 30, 2019, the Company had no borrowings outstanding on its Revolving Credit Facility and the availability under the Revolving Credit Facility was $35,000. The Company’s unamortized debt issuance costs related to the Revolving Credit Facility was $451 and $383 as of June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. As of June 30, 2019, the Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants under its Fourth Amended Credit Agreement. 12. INCOME TAXES Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and equity by jurisdiction were all in the U.S. except for income of $70 and $112 and a loss of $53 in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. For the years ended June 30, the components of the provision for income taxes are as follows: For the Years Ended June 30, 2019 2018 2017 Current income tax expense: Federal $ 10,405 $ 12,140 $ 5,803 State 1,892 276 1,584 Benefit of operating loss carryforwards (171 ) (117 ) (118 ) Total current tax expense 12,126 12,299 7,269 Deferred tax (benefit) expense: Federal (5,837 ) 525 4,154 State (897 ) 32 300 Total deferred tax (benefit) expense (6,734 ) 557 4,454 Income tax expense $ 5,392 $ 12,856 $ 11,723 The difference between the statutory and the effective federal tax rate for the periods below is attributable to the following: For the Years Ended June, 30 2019 2018 2017 Statutory income tax rate 21.00 % 28.06 % 35.00 % State taxes (net of federal income tax benefit and valuation allowance) 2.48 2.32 2.83 Change in valuation allowance (0.57 ) — — Tax credits (3.39 ) (0.44 ) (0.62 ) Revalue of deferred taxes for change in federal tax rate — (1.23 ) — Uncertain tax positions 3.10 (1.73 ) 1.93 Permanent differences (2.54 ) (2.41 ) (1.72 ) Other 0.08 (0.09 ) 0.04 Effective income tax rate 20.16 % 24.48 % 37.46 % F-22 As of June 30, 201 9 and 201 8 , a summary of the significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities was as follows: 2019 2018 Deferred tax assets: Warranty reserves $ 3,848 $ 2,898 Intangible asset basis difference 2,306 — Repurchase agreements 427 247 Accrued selling 1,354 — Unrecognized tax benefits 520 357 Stock Compensation 704 467 State net operating loss 144 130 Foreign net operating loss 79 81 Valuation allowance (81 ) (211 ) Credits 48 — Total deferred tax assets 9,349 3,969 Deferred tax liabilities: Depreciation (3,037 ) (1,262 ) Intangible asset basis difference — (4,009 ) Other (72 ) (125 ) Total deferred tax liabilities (3,109 ) (5,396 ) Net deferred tax assets (liabilities) $ 6,240 $ (1,427 ) 2019 2018 Noncurrent deferred tax assets (liabilities) 6,240 (1,427 ) Net deferred tax assets (liabilities) $ 6,240 $ (1,427 ) The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Reform Act”), which became effective December 22, 2017, overhauls U.S. corporate income tax law by lowering the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% (blended rate in year one for fiscal year filers), implementing a territorial tax system, imposing a one time “deemed repatriation” tax on all untaxed offshore earnings, and adding/modifying/deleting several major tax deductions significant to the Company. The Company’s deferred tax liabilities decreased $647 in fiscal 2018 from the impact of the corporate tax rate change from the Tax Reform Act. The Company has state net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards of $2,785 that expire in varying years ranging from June 30, 2024 to June 30, 2029, and foreign NOL carryforwards of $376 that can be carried forward indefinitely. However, the Company determined that it is more likely than not that the benefit from certain state and foreign NOL carryforwards will not be realized. In recognition of this risk, the Company has provided a partial valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets relating to these state and foreign NOL carryforwards. Unrecognized Tax Benefits A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits, excluding accrued amounts for interest and penalties, is as follows: 2019 2018 Balance at July 1 $ 1,711 $ 2,442 Additions based on tax positions related to the current year 889 373 Additions for tax positions of prior years 473 180 Reductions for tax positions of prior years (25 ) (61 ) Settlements of tax positions from prior years (544 ) (1,223 ) Balance at June 30 $ 2,504 $ 1,711 F-23 Of this total, $ 1,934 and $ 1,308 as of June 30, 201 9 and 201 8 , respectively represent the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably affect the effective income tax rate in future periods. The total amount of interest and penalties recorded in the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended June 30, 201 9 , and 201 8 was a n expense of $120, and a benefit of $288, respectively. The amounts accrued for interest and penalties at June 30, 201 9 and 201 8 were $ 391 and $ 271 respectively and is presented in unrecognized tax positions on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. In general, it is the practice and intention of the Company to reinvest the earnings of its non-U.S. subsidiaries in those operations. As of June 30, 2019, the Company has not made a provision for U.S. or additional foreign withholding taxes on investments in foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested. Generally, such amounts become subject to U.S. taxation upon the remittance of dividends and under certain other circumstances. The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal income tax, as well as various other state income taxes and foreign income taxes. The Company is no longer subject to examination by taxing authorities for years before June 30, 2016. The Company expects the total amount of unrecognized benefits to increase by approximately $968 in the next twelve months. The Company records unrecognized tax benefits as liabilities and adjusts these liabilities when its judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. Because of the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the unrecognized tax benefit liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which new information is available. 13. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION During the year ended June 30, 2015 the Company adopted the Amended and Restated MCBC Holdings, Inc. 2015 Incentive Award Plan (“2015 Plan”) in order to facilitate the grant of cash and equity incentives to non-employee directors, employees, and consultants of the Company and certain of its affiliates and to enable the Company and certain of its affiliates to obtain and retain the services of these individuals, which is essential to its long-term success. On July 16, 2015 the Board amended and restated the 2015 Plan which provided that the aggregate number of shares available to be issued thereunder was 220,723. On July 22, 2015, the Company consummated an 11.139-for-1 stock split in connection with the Company’s initial public offering (“Stock Split”). In accordance with the terms of the 2015 Plan, the Stock Split increased the shares available for issuance commensurately, to 2,458,633 shares. The Plan provides for the grant of stock options, including incentive stock options, and nonqualified stock options (“NSOs”), restricted stock, dividend equivalents, stock payments, restricted stock units, restricted stock awards (“RSAs”), deferred stock, deferred stock units, performance awards, stock appreciation rights, performance stock units (“PSUs”), and cash awards. As of June 30, 2019, there were 1,613,864 shares available for issuance under the 2015 Plan. Restricted Stock Awards Beginning in fiscal year 2017, all RSAs granted to non-employees vest over the remainder of that fiscal year, and all RSAs granted to employees vest over a period of between one to three years. Generally, non-vested RSAs are forfeited if employment is terminated prior to vesting. RSAs are granted at a per share fair value equal to the market value of the Company’s common stock on the grant date. The Company recognizes the cost of non-vested RSAs ratably over the requisite service period. During the years ended June 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Company recognized $913, $616, and $321, respectively, of compensation expense for non-vested RSAs. The related income tax benefit recognized during the years ended June 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $217, $190, and $121, respectively. The fair value of RSAs vested during the years ended June 30, 2019, 2018, and 2017 was $713, $434, and $240, respectively. F-24 A summary of RSA activity for the years ended June 30, 201 9 , 201 8 and 201 7 , is as follows: Number of Restricted Stock Awards Outstanding Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Total Non-vested Restricted Stock Awards at June 30, 2016 — $ — Granted 47,131 12.22 Vested (18,740 ) 18.94 Forfeited (1,974 ) 19.55 Total Non-vested Restricted Stock Awards at June 30, 2017 26,417 12.22 Granted 47,651 19.88 Vested (25,870 ) 16.79 Forfeited (4,888 ) 15.89 Total Non-vested Restricted Stock Awards at June 30, 2018 43,310 17.28 Granted 51,995 26.79 Vested (33,093 ) 21.54 Forfeited (8,408 ) 23.08 Total Non-vested Restricted Stock Awards at June 30, 2019 53,804 22.94 As of June 30, 2019, there was $764 of total unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested RSAs. The Company expects this expense to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.75 years. Performance Stock Units During the years ended June 30, 2019, 2018, and 2017, the Company granted performance shares to certain employees. The awards will be earned based on the Company’s achievement of certain performance criteria over a three-year performance period. The performance period for the awards commence on July 1 of the fiscal year in which they were granted and continue for a three-year period, ending on June 30 of the applicable year. The probability of achieving the performance criteria is assessed quarterly. Following the determination of the Company’s achievement with respect to the performance criteria, the amount of shares awarded will be subject to adjustment based on the application of a total shareholder return (“TSR”) modifier. The grant date fair value is determined based on both the assessment of the probability of the Company’s achieving the performance criteria and an estimate of the expected TSR modifier. The TSR modifier estimate is determined by using a Monte Carlo Simulation model, which considers the likelihood of all possible outcomes of long-term market performance. Compensation expense related to non-vested PSUs is recognized ratably over the performance period. During the years ended June 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Company recognized $563, $355, and $150, respectively, of compensation expense for non-vested PSUs. The related income tax benefit recognized during the years ended June 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $134, $110, and $56, respectively. The fair value of PSUs vested during the year ended June 30, 2019 was $384. No PSUs vested during the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017. F-25 A summary of PSU activity for the years ending June 30, 201 9 , 201 8 and 201 7 , is as follows: Number of Performance Stock Units Outstanding Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Total Non-vested Performance Stock Units at June 30, 2016 — $ — Granted 42,586 11.85 Vested — — Forfeited (1,974 ) 11.85 Total Non-vested Performance Stock Units at June 30, 2017 40,612 11.85 Granted 26,416 19.62 Vested — — Forfeited (7,700 ) 14.42 Total Non-vested Performance Stock Units at June 30, 2018 59,328 14.98 Granted 35,122 25.70 Vested (32,373 ) 11.85 Forfeited (11,456 ) 19.73 Total Non-vested Performance Stock Units at June 30, 2019 50,621 23.34 As of June 30, 2019, there was $750 of total unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested PSUs. The Company expects this expense to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.8 years. Nonqualified Stock Options In July 2015, the Company granted 137,786 NSOs to certain employees at an option price equal to the $15.00 per share of the Company’s common stock, which was the initial public offering price. These NSOs vested in four equal annual installments on each of the first four grant date anniversaries. Pursuant to the terms of the 2015 Plan, the exercise price of options were reduced by $4.30, the amount of the special cash dividend paid on June 10, 2016, from an exercise price of $15.00 to an exercise price of $10.70. The other terms of the options remain unchanged. The Company estimated the grant date fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes pricing model assuming a risk-free interest rate of 1.93%, an expected term of 6.25 years, no dividend yield and a volatility rate of 56.7%. The Company determined that it did not have sufficient information on which to base a reasonable and supportable estimate of expected volatility of its share price, because of limited or no active stock transactions with third parties. Therefore, the Company elected to use the calculated value method. Under this method, the Company used comparable public companies to estimate expected volatility. The Company used historical data to estimate option exercise and post-vesting termination behavior. The risk-free interest rate for the expected term of the option was based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant. During the years ended June 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Company recognized $201, $215, and $240, respectively, of compensation expense for non-vested NSOs. The related income tax benefit recognized during the years ended June 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $48, $66, and $91, respectively. The fair value of NSOs vested during the years ended June 30, 2019, 2018, and 2017 was $215, $215, and $253, respectively. F-26 A summary of NSO activity for the years ending June 30, 201 9 , 201 8, and 201 7 is as follows: Weighted Weighted Average Average Remaining Aggregate Exercise Contractual Intrinsic Shares Price Term (Yrs.)

Under the terms of these repurchase agreements, the Company is obligated to repurchase inventory repossessed by these financial institutions for a period ranging up to 30 months from the date of the original sale of the products to the respective dealers. Repossession of products by the financial institutions normally occurs when a dealer goes out of business or defaults with a lender. The maximum obligation of the Company under such floor plan agreements totaled approximately $229,744 as of June 30, 2019. We incurred no material impact from repurchase events during the years ended June 30, 2019, 2018, and 2017. The Company recorded a repurchase liability of $1,936 and $1,265 as of June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, after giving effect to proceeds anticipated to be received from the resale of those products to alternative dealers, and taking into consideration the credit quality of the dealers. Purchase Commitments The Company is engaged in an exclusive contract with a single vendor to provide engines for its MasterCraft performance sport boats. This contract makes this vendor the only supplier to MasterCraft for in-board engines and expires June 30, 2023. The Company is F-27 obligated to purchase a minimum number of engines for each model year under this contract . The Company could also be required to pay a penalty to this vendor in order to maintain exclusivity if annual purchases under the agreement fail to meet a certain threshold. Legal Proceedings The Company is involved in certain claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of these matters is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations. 15.
