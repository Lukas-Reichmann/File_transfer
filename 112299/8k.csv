Non-GAAP Financial Measures: * Operational sales growth, which excludes the impact of translational currency, and adjusted operational earnings per share, which excludes the impact of translational currency, after-tax intangible amortization expense and special items, are non-GAAP financial measures. The Company believes that providing these non-GAAP financial measures enhance the Company’s and investors’ understanding of our financial performance. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures determined or calculated in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s definitions of its non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The Company is not providing a reconciliation, however, because Johnson & Johnson does not provide GAAP financial measures on a forward-looking basis as the Company is unable to predict with reasonable certainty the ultimate outcome of adjusted items, such as legal proceedings, unusual gains and losses, acquisition-related expenses, and purchase accounting fair value adjustments without unreasonable effort. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could be material to Johnson & Johnson's results computed in accordance with GAAP. Note to Investors Concerning Forward-Looking Statements: This press release contains “forward-looking statements” as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 regarding, among other things: future operating and financial performance, product development, and market position and business strategy. The reader is cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations of future events. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results could vary materially from the expectations and projections of Johnson & Johnson. Risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: economic factors, such as interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; competition, including technological advances, new products and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new product research and development, including uncertainty of clinical success and obtaining regulatory approvals; uncertainty of commercial success for new and existing products; challenges to patents; the impact of patent expirations; the ability of the Company to successfully execute strategic plans, including restructuring plans; the impact of business combinations and divestitures; manufacturing difficulties or delays, internally or within the supply chain; product efficacy or safety concerns resulting in product recalls or regulatory action; significant adverse litigation or government action, including related to product liability claims; changes to applicable laws and regulations, including tax laws and global health care reforms; trends toward health care cost containment; changes in behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of health care products and services; financial instability of international economies and legal systems and sovereign risk; increased scrutiny of the health care industry by government agencies; the Company’s ability to realize the anticipated benefits from the separation of the Company’s Consumer Health business; and the New Consumer Health Company’s ability to succeed as a standalone publicly traded company. A further list and descriptions of these risks, uncertainties and other factors can be found in Johnson & Johnson’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 1, 2023, including in the sections captioned “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” and in Johnson & Johnson’s subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures: * Operational sales growth, which excludes the impact of translational currency, and adjusted operational earnings per share, which excludes the impact of translational currency, after-tax intangible amortization expense and special items, are non-GAAP financial measures. The Company believes that providing these non-GAAP financial measures enhance the Company’s and investors’ understanding of our financial performance. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures determined or calculated in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s definitions of its non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The Company is not providing a reconciliation, however, because Johnson & Johnson does not provide GAAP financial measures on a forward-looking basis as the Company is unable to predict with reasonable certainty the ultimate outcome of adjusted items, such as legal proceedings, unusual gains and losses, acquisition-related expenses, and purchase accounting fair value adjustments without unreasonable effort. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could be material to Johnson & Johnson's results computed in accordance with GAAP.

MASTERCRAFT BOAT HOLDINGS, INC. Dated: September 12, 2019 /s/ Timothy M. Oxley Timothy M. Oxley Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Secretary -;-EX-99.1: Exhibit 99.1 MasterCraft Boat Holdings, Inc. Reports Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2019 Results VONORE, Tenn. – September 12, 2019 – MasterCraft Boat Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: MCFT) today announced financial results for its fiscal 2019 fourth quarter and full year ended June 30, 2019. Fourth Quarter Highlights: • Net sales increased to $122.8 million, up 28.7 percent from $95.4 million in the prior-year period. • GAAP diluted earnings (loss) per share were $(0.54), including a $31.0 million, or $(1.65) per share, goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charge related to NauticStar (the “NauticStar Charge”). • Fully diluted Adjusted Net Income per share, a non-GAAP measure, grew $0.17, or 25.0 percent, to $0.85, up from $0.68 in the prior-year period. • Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, rose 19.9 percent to $23.8 million from $19.8 million in the prior-year period. Full Year Highlights: • Net sales increased to $466.4 million, up 40.2 percent from $332.7 million in the prior-year period. • GAAP diluted earnings (loss) per share decreased to $1.14, including the NauticStar Charge, or $(1.65) per share. • Fully diluted Adjusted Net Income per share, a non-GAAP measure, grew $0.66, or 30.7 percent, to $2.81, up from $2.15 in the prior-year period. • Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, grew 23.9 percent to $79.3 million from $64.0 million in the prior-year period. • Cash debt repayments totaled $41.3 million, driven by the company’s strong cash generation. Terry McNew, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “MasterCraft Boat Holdings delivered strong operational results in the fourth quarter, closing out our fiscal 2019 on a strong note. Despite many headwinds faced throughout the year, including import tariffs, adverse weather throughout the country during the selling season – especially in June – and macroeconomic uncertainty, our team once again generated record levels of net sales and adjusted earnings. Moreover, our strong cash management practices enabled us to significantly reduce our total debt.” Fourth Quarter Results Net Sales for the fourth quarter were $122.8 million, reflecting an increase of $27.4 million, or 28.7 percent, compared to $95.4 million for the prior-year period. The increase was primarily due to: • an increase at MasterCraft of $6.0 million, or 8.1 percent, primarily due to an increase in unit sales volume, favorable product mix and price increases; • the inclusion of Crest, which incrementally added net sales of $ 23.3 million ; and partially offset by • a decrease at NauticStar of $1.9 million, or 8.8 percent, primarily due to a reduction in volume as production was slowed to match wholesale shipments with retail demand, partially offset by favorable product mix and price increases. Gross profit increased $3.6 million, or 12.9 percent, to $31.5 million compared to $27.9 million for the prior-year period. The increase was primarily due to: • the increases in MasterCraft unit sales volumes, price increases, and favorable product mix, partially offset by a year-over-year increase in warranty expense resulting from the favorable one-time warranty adjustment taken in the fourth quarter of 2018; • the inclusion of Crest, which contributed $4.3 million to gross profit; and partially offset by • a $1.1 million decrease in gross profit for NauticStar, principally due to the decrease in volume. Given the above-mentioned factors, gross margin decreased to 25.6 percent for the fourth quarter compared to 29.2 percent for the prior-year period. Operating expenses increased $34.1 million, or 381.0 percent, to $43.0 million for the fourth quarter compared to $8.9 million for the prior-year period. This increase resulted mainly from the NauticStar Charge and the inclusion of Crest, which increased operating expenses by $1.8 million. As a result of the company’s annual goodwill analysis at June 30, 2019, the NauticStar Charge was recorded. NauticStar has continued to experience market-wide challenges that have impacted the business’s ability to grow at the rate that was originally estimated when it was acquired in 2017. Specifically, NauticStar’s core market, the saltwater fishing boat market, has seen slowing retail demand, especially for boats less than 25 feet in length. These models represent a significant percentage of the brand’s current model mix. In response, NauticStar has pulled back production on smaller boats to ensure wholesale shipments align with retail demand, which has impacted operating margins. In addition to the company and market-specific headwinds, lower valuation multiples of peer group companies contributed to the amount of the impairment charge. As has previously been disclosed, NauticStar is developing new, larger models which will improve operating margins and mitigate lower demand for smaller boats in the future. Commented McNew, “While the saltwater fishing market has experienced a slowdown this past year, further exacerbated by poor weather this selling season, we are bullish about the NauticStar brand and its long-term prospects. Our dealer pipeline at NauticStar ended the year at healthy levels given our prudent decision to pull back on wholesale production earlier in the year, and both the 251 Hybrid and 32-foot XS center console will help mitigate the declines in the smaller boat market. In the near-term, this market slowdown has delayed the initial growth projections developed at the time of the acquisition, but NauticStar remains a leading brand in the market it serves. Combined with the new product development strategies we are deploying – including the introduction of larger, in-demand models – and the early stages of several operating initiatives we are driving, we believe the brand will be positioned better than ever to take advantage of a market recovery, leading to greater operating efficiencies and long-term profitable growth.” Operating expenses, as a percentage of net sales, increased by 25.6 percentage points to 35.0 percent for the fourth quarter compared to 9.4 percent for the prior-year period. This impact resulted primarily from the NauticStar Charge. Excluding this non-cash impairment charge, acquisition-related and integration costs, and start-up costs for the company’s new Aviara brand, operating expenses as a percentage of sales decreased 0.2 percentage points to 9.0 percent for the fourth quarter compared to 9.2 percent for the prior-year period. Net Income (loss) for the fourth quarter was $(10.1) million, reflecting a decrease of $23.2 million, or 176.5 percent, compared to $13.1 million for the prior-year period. The decrease was primarily due to the NauticStar Charge. Adjusted Net Income of $16.1 million, or $0.85 per share, on a fully diluted, weighted average share count of 18.9 million shares, was computed using the company’s estimated annual effective tax rate of approximately 22.5 percent. This compares to Adjusted Net Income of $12.8 million, or $0.68 per fully diluted share, in the prior-year period. Adjusted EBITDA was $23.8 million for the fourth quarter, compared to $19.8 million in the prior-year period. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 19.4 percent, down from 20.8 percent in prior-year period principally due to the dilutive effect of Crest. See “Non-GAAP Measures” below for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and Adjusted Net Income to the most directly comparable financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP. Fiscal 2019 Results Net Sales for fiscal 2019 were $466.4 million, an increase of $133.7 million, or 40.2 percent, compared to $332.7 million for fiscal 2018. The gain was primarily due to: • an increase at MasterCraft of $45.5 million, or 17.1 percent, primarily driven by an increase in unit sales volume, favorable product mix and price increases, offset by higher discounts to support our Canadian and European Union dealers impacted by retaliatory import tariffs; • the inclusion of Crest, which grew net sales by $76.6 million; and • a net $11.6 million increase in net sales for NauticStar, driven by the inclusion of NauticStar in our fiscal 2019 first quarter results, partially offset by a decrease in volume due to softness in NauticStar’s core market. Gross profit increased $22.8 million, or 25.2 percent, to $113.1 million compared to $90.4 million for fiscal 2018. The increase was primarily due to: • an increase in MasterCraft unit sales volumes, price increases, and favorable product mix, offset by increased warranty costs and higher discounts to support Canadian and European Union dealers impacted by retaliatory import tariffs; • the inclusion of Crest, which contributed $13.6 million to gross profit; and partially offset by • a net $1.2 million decrease in gross profit for NauticStar, driven by a decrease in volume, partially offset by the inclusion of NauticStar in our fiscal 2019 first quarter results. Given the above-mentioned factors, gross margin decreased to 24.3 percent for fiscal 2019 compared to 27.2 percent for fiscal 2018. Operating expenses increased $45.5 million, or 132.3 percent, to $79.9 million for fiscal 2019 compared to $34.4 million for fiscal 2018. This increase resulted mainly from: • the NauticStar Charge; • the inclusion of Crest, which increased operating expenses by $6.5 million; • an increase of $2.3 million in startup costs related to Aviara; • the incremental inclusion of NauticStar in our fiscal 2019 first quarter results, which added $1.9 million; and • an increase of $1.9 million in intangible asset amortization, which includes the effects of both the NauticStar and Crest acquisitions, principally for dealer networks. Operating expenses, as a percentage of net sales, increased by 6.8 percentage points to 17.1 percent for fiscal 2019 compared to 10.3 percent for fiscal 2018. This increase resulted primarily from the NauticStar Charge. Excluding this non-cash impairment charge, acquisition-related and integration costs, and start-up costs for Aviara, operating expenses as a percentage of sales decreased 0.1 percentage points to 9.5 percent for fiscal 2019 compared to 9.6 percent for fiscal 2018. Net Income for fiscal 2019 was $21.4 million, reflecting a decrease of $18.3 million, or 46.1 percent, compared to $39.7 million for fiscal 2018. The decrease was primarily due to the NauticStar Charge. Adjusted Net Income of $53.0 million, or $2.81 per share, on a fully diluted, weighted average share count of 18.8 million shares, was computed using the company’s estimated annual effective tax rate of approximately 22.5 percent. This compares to Adjusted Net Income of $40.4 million, or $2.15 per fully diluted share, in the prior-year period. Adjusted EBITDA was $79.3 million for fiscal 2019, compared to $64.0 million in the prior-year period. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 17 percent, down from 19.2 percent in fiscal 2018 principally due to the dilutive effect of NauticStar and Crest. See “Non-GAAP Measures” below for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and Adjusted Net Income to the most directly comparable financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP. Outlook Said McNew, “We remain bullish on the long-term prospects of both the markets we serve and the brands we own, irrespective of any near-term fluctuations. We firmly believe our long-tenured, industry-veteran leadership team and seasoned and dedicated employees, together with our low-fixed cost, highly-variable cost structure, best-in-class net working capital management, and strong balance sheet, position the company to perform in all economic environments. “At MasterCraft, retail trends throughout the first nine months of our fiscal 2019 were running ahead of plan, with year-to-date internal warranty registrations up significantly year-over-year at the end of our fiscal third quarter. However, adverse weather conditions across the country during the all-important selling season, along with eroding dealer sentiment – driven by macro-economic and political uncertainty – resulted in a significant decline in retail activity. As such, our fiscal 2020 outlook contemplates lower wholesale shipments at MasterCraft compared to prior-year, particularly in the first half of our fiscal year. We believe it’s prudent to holdback wholesale production to allow for healthy dealer pipelines at MasterCraft heading into the calendar 2020 selling season, in anticipation of continued growth in the overall performance sport segment. “At NauticStar, our quick reaction to the retail declines in the saltwater fishing market resulted in pulling back wholesale production earlier in the year, resulting in healthy dealer pipelines levels at fiscal 2019 year-end. We will continue to be disciplined with NauticStar’s dealer pipeline, while beginning to realize the AUSP benefits from new, larger models introduced late last year. “Similarly, our Crest brand was impacted by the adverse weather conditions and decline in dealer sentiment, wiping out the strong retail performance Crest experienced during our first six months of ownership. Accordingly, we are tempering our wholesale production at Crest for fiscal 2020 to allow for healthy dealer pipeline levels entering the calendar 2020 selling season. Recall Crest was acquired during our fiscal second quarter last year. We are very optimistic on Crest and the pontoon segment overall, and anticipate that the product development and operational initiatives we are driving will contribute to long-term market share and profitability gains. “Beginning in fiscal 2020, our new Aviara brand began shipping to MarineMax dealers across the country. We are extremely excited about the response the brand has received from MarineMax dealers, consumers and industry experts alike. Aviara’s financial results will be reported in our MasterCraft reporting segment. As previously disclosed, our preliminary expectation is for a net sales contribution from Aviara in the $10 to $15 million range in its first partial year of production. Aviara is expected to be slightly accretive to our MasterCraft reporting segment gross margin profile. Given the above-mentioned factors, the company’s consolidated fiscal 2020 outlook is as follows: ▪ Net Sales – down low-single digit percent ▪ Adjusted EBITDA Margin – down 50 to 100 basis points ▪ Adjusted Earnings per Share – down high-single digit percent “We strongly believe in the long-term value that the full breadth of our brands and capabilities can provide, despite any near-term market uncertainties. Maintaining our focus on developing best-in-class, innovative products across our portfolio and driving continued operational excellence at all our businesses will drive meaningful value for consumers, while improving our bottom line and generating attractive returns for shareholders over the long-term,” concluded McNew.

We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA further adjusted to eliminate certain non-cash charges and other items that we do not consider to be indicative of our ongoing operations, including goodwill and intangible impairment charges, transaction expenses associated with acquisitions, acquisition related inventory step-up adjustment, certain litigation charges, an out-of-period adjustment to correct an immaterial error related to our warranty reserve, new brand startup costs, and our stock-based compensation. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA expressed as a percentage of net sales. We define Adjusted Net Income as net income adjusted to eliminate certain non-cash charges and other items that we do not consider to be indicative of our ongoing operations, including goodwill and intangible impairment charges, transaction expenses associated with acquisitions, acquisition related inventory step-up adjustment, certain litigation charges, an out-of-period adjustment to correct an immaterial error related to our warranty reserve, new brand startup costs, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and our stock-based compensation. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, and Adjusted Net Income are not measures of net income or operating income as determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which we refer to as GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income are not measures of performance in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or operating cash flows determined in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of cash flow for management’s discretionary use. We believe that the inclusion of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and Adjusted Net Income is appropriate to provide additional information to investors because securities analysts, noteholders and other investors use these non-GAAP financial measures to assess our operating performance across periods on a consistent basis and to evaluate the relative risk of an investment in our securities. We use Adjusted Net Income to facilitate a comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis from period to period that, when viewed in combination with our results prepared in accordance with GAAP, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than GAAP alone measures. We believe Adjusted Net Income assists our board of directors, management and investors in comparing our net income on a consistent basis from period to period because it removes non-cash items and items not indicative of our ongoing operations. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: • Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; • Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; • Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; • Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our tax expense or any cash requirements to pay income taxes; • Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest payments on our indebtedness; and • Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters we do not consider to be indicative of our ongoing operations, but may nonetheless have a material impact on our results of operations. In addition, because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, including companies in our industry.

MASTERCRAFT BOAT HOLDINGS, INC. Dated: September 12, 2019 /s/ Timothy M. Oxley Timothy M. Oxley Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Secretary ","EX-99.1: Exhibit 99.1 MasterCraft Boat Holdings, Inc. Reports Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2019 Results VONORE, Tenn. – September 12, 2019 – MasterCraft Boat Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: MCFT) today announced financial results for its fiscal 2019 fourth quarter and full year ended June 30, 2019. Fourth Quarter Highlights: • Net sales increased to $122.8 million, up 28.7 percent from $95.4 million in the prior-year period. • GAAP diluted earnings (loss) per share were $(0.54), including a $31.0 million, or $(1.65) per share, goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charge related to NauticStar (the “NauticStar Charge”). • Fully diluted Adjusted Net Income per share, a non-GAAP measure, grew $0.17, or 25.0 percent, to $0.85, up from $0.68 in the prior-year period. • Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, rose 19.9 percent to $23.8 million from $19.8 million in the prior-year period. Full Year Highlights: • Net sales increased to $466.4 million, up 40.2 percent from $332.7 million in the prior-year period. • GAAP diluted earnings (loss) per share decreased to $1.14, including the NauticStar Charge, or $(1.65) per share. • Fully diluted Adjusted Net Income per share, a non-GAAP measure, grew $0.66, or 30.7 percent, to $2.81, up from $2.15 in the prior-year period. • Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, grew 23.9 percent to $79.3 million from $64.0 million in the prior-year period. • Cash debt repayments totaled $41.3 million, driven by the company’s strong cash generation. Terry McNew, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “MasterCraft Boat Holdings delivered strong operational results in the fourth quarter, closing out our fiscal 2019 on a strong note. Despite many headwinds faced throughout the year, including import tariffs, adverse weather throughout the country during the selling season – especially in June – and macroeconomic uncertainty, our team once again generated record levels of net sales and adjusted earnings. Moreover, our strong cash management practices enabled us to significantly reduce our total debt.” Fourth Quarter Results Net Sales for the fourth quarter were $122.8 million, reflecting an increase of $27.4 million, or 28.7 percent, compared to $95.4 million for the prior-year period. The increase was primarily due to: • an increase at MasterCraft of $6.0 million, or 8.1 percent, primarily due to an increase in unit sales volume, favorable product mix and price increases; • the inclusion of Crest, which incrementally added net sales of $ 23.3 million ; and partially offset by • a decrease at NauticStar of $1.9 million, or 8.8 percent, primarily due to a reduction in volume as production was slowed to match wholesale shipments with retail demand, partially offset by favorable product mix and price increases. Gross profit increased $3.6 million, or 12.9 percent, to $31.5 million compared to $27.9 million for the prior-year period. The increase was primarily due to: • the increases in MasterCraft unit sales volumes, price increases, and favorable product mix, partially offset by a year-over-year increase in warranty expense resulting from the favorable one-time warranty adjustment taken in the fourth quarter of 2018; • the inclusion of Crest, which contributed $4.3 million to gross profit; and partially offset by • a $1.1 million decrease in gross profit for NauticStar, principally due to the decrease in volume. Given the above-mentioned factors, gross margin decreased to 25.6 percent for the fourth quarter compared to 29.2 percent for the prior-year period. Operating expenses increased $34.1 million, or 381.0 percent, to $43.0 million for the fourth quarter compared to $8.9 million for the prior-year period. This increase resulted mainly from the NauticStar Charge and the inclusion of Crest, which increased operating expenses by $1.8 million. As a result of the company’s annual goodwill analysis at June 30, 2019, the NauticStar Charge was recorded. NauticStar has continued to experience market-wide challenges that have impacted the business’s ability to grow at the rate that was originally estimated when it was acquired in 2017. Specifically, NauticStar’s core market, the saltwater fishing boat market, has seen slowing retail demand, especially for boats less than 25 feet in length. These models represent a significant percentage of the brand’s current model mix. In response, NauticStar has pulled back production on smaller boats to ensure wholesale shipments align with retail demand, which has impacted operating margins. In addition to the company and market-specific headwinds, lower valuation multiples of peer group companies contributed to the amount of the impairment charge. As has previously been disclosed, NauticStar is developing new, larger models which will improve operating margins and mitigate lower demand for smaller boats in the future. Commented McNew, “While the saltwater fishing market has experienced a slowdown this past year, further exacerbated by poor weather this selling season, we are bullish about the NauticStar brand and its long-term prospects. Our dealer pipeline at NauticStar ended the year at healthy levels given our prudent decision to pull back on wholesale production earlier in the year, and both the 251 Hybrid and 32-foot XS center console will help mitigate the declines in the smaller boat market. In the near-term, this market slowdown has delayed the initial growth projections developed at the time of the acquisition, but NauticStar remains a leading brand in the market it serves. Combined with the new product development strategies we are deploying – including the introduction of larger, in-demand models – and the early stages of several operating initiatives we are driving, we believe the brand will be positioned better than ever to take advantage of a market recovery, leading to greater operating efficiencies and long-term profitable growth.” Operating expenses, as a percentage of net sales, increased by 25.6 percentage points to 35.0 percent for the fourth quarter compared to 9.4 percent for the prior-year period. This impact resulted primarily from the NauticStar Charge. Excluding this non-cash impairment charge, acquisition-related and integration costs, and start-up costs for the company’s new Aviara brand, operating expenses as a percentage of sales decreased 0.2 percentage points to 9.0 percent for the fourth quarter compared to 9.2 percent for the prior-year period. Net Income (loss) for the fourth quarter was $(10.1) million, reflecting a decrease of $23.2 million, or 176.5 percent, compared to $13.1 million for the prior-year period. The decrease was primarily due to the NauticStar Charge. Adjusted Net Income of $16.1 million, or $0.85 per share, on a fully diluted, weighted average share count of 18.9 million shares, was computed using the company’s estimated annual effective tax rate of approximately 22.5 percent. This compares to Adjusted Net Income of $12.8 million, or $0.68 per fully diluted share, in the prior-year period. Adjusted EBITDA was $23.8 million for the fourth quarter, compared to $19.8 million in the prior-year period. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 19.4 percent, down from 20.8 percent in prior-year period principally due to the dilutive effect of Crest. See “Non-GAAP Measures” below for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and Adjusted Net Income to the most directly comparable financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP. Fiscal 2019 Results Net Sales for fiscal 2019 were $466.4 million, an increase of $133.7 million, or 40.2 percent, compared to $332.7 million for fiscal 2018. The gain was primarily due to: • an increase at MasterCraft of $45.5 million, or 17.1 percent, primarily driven by an increase in unit sales volume, favorable product mix and price increases, offset by higher discounts to support our Canadian and European Union dealers impacted by retaliatory import tariffs; • the inclusion of Crest, which grew net sales by $76.6 million; and • a net $11.6 million increase in net sales for NauticStar, driven by the inclusion of NauticStar in our fiscal 2019 first quarter results, partially offset by a decrease in volume due to softness in NauticStar’s core market. Gross profit increased $22.8 million, or 25.2 percent, to $113.1 million compared to $90.4 million for fiscal 2018. The increase was primarily due to: • an increase in MasterCraft unit sales volumes, price increases, and favorable product mix, offset by increased warranty costs and higher discounts to support Canadian and European Union dealers impacted by retaliatory import tariffs; • the inclusion of Crest, which contributed $13.6 million to gross profit; and partially offset by • a net $1.2 million decrease in gross profit for NauticStar, driven by a decrease in volume, partially offset by the inclusion of NauticStar in our fiscal 2019 first quarter results. Given the above-mentioned factors, gross margin decreased to 24.3 percent for fiscal 2019 compared to 27.2 percent for fiscal 2018. Operating expenses increased $45.5 million, or 132.3 percent, to $79.9 million for fiscal 2019 compared to $34.4 million for fiscal 2018. This increase resulted mainly from: • the NauticStar Charge; • the inclusion of Crest, which increased operating expenses by $6.5 million; • an increase of $2.3 million in startup costs related to Aviara; • the incremental inclusion of NauticStar in our fiscal 2019 first quarter results, which added $1.9 million; and • an increase of $1.9 million in intangible asset amortization, which includes the effects of both the NauticStar and Crest acquisitions, principally for dealer networks. Operating expenses, as a percentage of net sales, increased by 6.8 percentage points to 17.1 percent for fiscal 2019 compared to 10.3 percent for fiscal 2018. This increase resulted primarily from the NauticStar Charge. Excluding this non-cash impairment charge, acquisition-related and integration costs, and start-up costs for Aviara, operating expenses as a percentage of sales decreased 0.1 percentage points to 9.5 percent for fiscal 2019 compared to 9.6 percent for fiscal 2018. Net Income for fiscal 2019 was $21.4 million, reflecting a decrease of $18.3 million, or 46.1 percent, compared to $39.7 million for fiscal 2018. The decrease was primarily due to the NauticStar Charge. Adjusted Net Income of $53.0 million, or $2.81 per share, on a fully diluted, weighted average share count of 18.8 million shares, was computed using the company’s estimated annual effective tax rate of approximately 22.5 percent. This compares to Adjusted Net Income of $40.4 million, or $2.15 per fully diluted share, in the prior-year period. Adjusted EBITDA was $79.3 million for fiscal 2019, compared to $64.0 million in the prior-year period. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 17 percent, down from 19.2 percent in fiscal 2018 principally due to the dilutive effect of NauticStar and Crest. See “Non-GAAP Measures” below for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and Adjusted Net Income to the most directly comparable financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP. Outlook Said McNew, “We remain bullish on the long-term prospects of both the markets we serve and the brands we own, irrespective of any near-term fluctuations. We firmly believe our long-tenured, industry-veteran leadership team and seasoned and dedicated employees, together with our low-fixed cost, highly-variable cost structure, best-in-class net working capital management, and strong balance sheet, position the company to perform in all economic environments. “At MasterCraft, retail trends throughout the first nine months of our fiscal 2019 were running ahead of plan, with year-to-date internal warranty registrations up significantly year-over-year at the end of our fiscal third quarter. However, adverse weather conditions across the country during the all-important selling season, along with eroding dealer sentiment – driven by macro-economic and political uncertainty – resulted in a significant decline in retail activity. As such, our fiscal 2020 outlook contemplates lower wholesale shipments at MasterCraft compared to prior-year, particularly in the first half of our fiscal year. We believe it’s prudent to holdback wholesale production to allow for healthy dealer pipelines at MasterCraft heading into the calendar 2020 selling season, in anticipation of continued growth in the overall performance sport segment. “At NauticStar, our quick reaction to the retail declines in the saltwater fishing market resulted in pulling back wholesale production earlier in the year, resulting in healthy dealer pipelines levels at fiscal 2019 year-end. We will continue to be disciplined with NauticStar’s dealer pipeline, while beginning to realize the AUSP benefits from new, larger models introduced late last year. “Similarly, our Crest brand was impacted by the adverse weather conditions and decline in dealer sentiment, wiping out the strong retail performance Crest experienced during our first six months of ownership. Accordingly, we are tempering our wholesale production at Crest for fiscal 2020 to allow for healthy dealer pipeline levels entering the calendar 2020 selling season. Recall Crest was acquired during our fiscal second quarter last year. We are very optimistic on Crest and the pontoon segment overall, and anticipate that the product development and operational initiatives we are driving will contribute to long-term market share and profitability gains. “Beginning in fiscal 2020, our new Aviara brand began shipping to MarineMax dealers across the country. We are extremely excited about the response the brand has received from MarineMax dealers, consumers and industry experts alike. Aviara’s financial results will be reported in our MasterCraft reporting segment. As previously disclosed, our preliminary expectation is for a net sales contribution from Aviara in the $10 to $15 million range in its first partial year of production. Aviara is expected to be slightly accretive to our MasterCraft reporting segment gross margin profile. Given the above-mentioned factors, the company’s consolidated fiscal 2020 outlook is as follows: ▪ Net Sales – down low-single digit percent ▪ Adjusted EBITDA Margin – down 50 to 100 basis points ▪ Adjusted Earnings per Share – down high-single digit percent “We strongly believe in the long-term value that the full breadth of our brands and capabilities can provide, despite any near-term market uncertainties. Maintaining our focus on developing best-in-class, innovative products across our portfolio and driving continued operational excellence at all our businesses will drive meaningful value for consumers, while improving our bottom line and generating attractive returns for shareholders over the long-term,” concluded McNew.

We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA further adjusted to eliminate certain non-cash charges and other items that we do not consider to be indicative of our ongoing operations, including goodwill and intangible impairment charges, transaction expenses associated with acquisitions, acquisition related inventory step-up adjustment, certain litigation charges, an out-of-period adjustment to correct an immaterial error related to our warranty reserve, new brand startup costs, and our stock-based compensation. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA expressed as a percentage of net sales. We define Adjusted Net Income as net income adjusted to eliminate certain non-cash charges and other items that we do not consider to be indicative of our ongoing operations, including goodwill and intangible impairment charges, transaction expenses associated with acquisitions, acquisition related inventory step-up adjustment, certain litigation charges, an out-of-period adjustment to correct an immaterial error related to our warranty reserve, new brand startup costs, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and our stock-based compensation. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, and Adjusted Net Income are not measures of net income or operating income as determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which we refer to as GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income are not measures of performance in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or operating cash flows determined in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of cash flow for management’s discretionary use. We believe that the inclusion of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and Adjusted Net Income is appropriate to provide additional information to investors because securities analysts, noteholders and other investors use these non-GAAP financial measures to assess our operating performance across periods on a consistent basis and to evaluate the relative risk of an investment in our securities. We use Adjusted Net Income to facilitate a comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis from period to period that, when viewed in combination with our results prepared in accordance with GAAP, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than GAAP alone measures. We believe Adjusted Net Income assists our board of directors, management and investors in comparing our net income on a consistent basis from period to period because it removes non-cash items and items not indicative of our ongoing operations. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: • Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; • Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; • Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; • Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our tax expense or any cash requirements to pay income taxes; • Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest payments on our indebtedness; and • Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters we do not consider to be indicative of our ongoing operations, but may nonetheless have a material impact on our results of operations. In addition, because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, including companies in our industry.
