See accompanying Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 5 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consoli dated Financial Statements 1. Basis of Presentation and Business Nature of Operations: Skyline Champion Corporation's (the “Company”) operations consist of manufacturing, retail, construction services, and transportation activities. At September 30, 2023, the Company operated 39 manufacturing facilities throughout the United States (“U.S.”) and five manufacturing facilities in western Canada that primarily construct factory-built, timber-framed manufactured and modular houses that are sold primarily to independent retailers, builders/developers, and manufactured home community operators. In addition to its core home building business, the Company provides construction services to install and set-up factory-built homes. The Company’s retail operations consist of 31 sales centers that sell manufactured houses to consumers across the U.S. The Company’s transportation business engages independent owners/drivers to transport recreational vehicles throughout the U.S. and Canada and manufactured houses in certain regions of the U.S. The Company also has a holding company located in the Netherlands. Basis of Presentation: The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) for Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Article 10 of SEC Regulation S-X. Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“U.S. GAAP”) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany balances and transactions. In the opinion of management, these statements include all normal recurring adjustments necessary to fairly state the Company’s consolidated results of operations, cash flows, and financial position. The Company has evaluated subsequent events after the balance sheet date through the date of the filing of this report with the SEC. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the SEC on May 30, 2023 (the “Fiscal 2023 Annual Report”). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The condensed consolidated income statements, condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income, and condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations or cash flows for the full year. The Company’s fiscal year is a 52- or 53-week period that ends on the Saturday nearest to March 31. The Company’s current fiscal year, “fiscal 2024,” will end on March 30, 2024 and will include 52 weeks. References to “fiscal 2023” refer to the Company’s fiscal year ended April 1, 2023. The three and six months ended September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022 each included 13 and 26 weeks, respectively. The Company’s allowance for credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost reflects management’s estimate of credit losses over the remaining expected life of such assets, measured primarily using historical experience, as well as current economic conditions and forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. Expected credit losses for newly recognized financial assets, as well as changes to expected credit losses during the period, are recognized in earnings. Accounts receivable are reflected net of reserves of $ 2.6 million and $ 1.7 million at September 30, 2023 and April 1, 2023, respectively. Floor plan receivables consist of loans the Company purchased from an independent financial institution in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 for $ 18.5 million, of which approximately $ 8.0 million remains outstanding at September 30, 2023, and amounts loaned by the Company through the financial institution to certain independent retailers for purchases of homes manufactured by the Company, of which $ 2.6 million was outstanding at September 30, 2023, both of which are carried net of payments received and recorded at amortized cost. The Company intends to hold the floor plan receivables until maturity or payoff. These loans are serviced by the financial institution for which we pay a servicing fee. Upon execution of the financing arrangement, the loans are generally payable at the earlier of the sale of the underlying home or two years from the origination date. At September 30, 2023, Floor Plan Receivables are included in Other Current Assets and Other Noncurrent Assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The floor plan receivables are collateralized by the related homes, mitigating loss exposure. The Company and the financial institution evaluate the credit worthiness of each independent retailer prior to credit approval, including reviewing the independent retailer’s payment history, financial condition, and overall economic environment. We evaluate the risk of credit loss in aggregate on existing loans with similar terms, based on historic experience and current economic conditions, as well as individual retailers with past due balances or other indications of heightened credit risk. The allowance for credit losses related to floor plan receivables was not material as of September 30, 2023. Loans are considered past due if any required interest or curtailment payment remains unpaid 30 days after the due date. Receivables are placed on non-performing status if any interest or installment payments are past due over 90 days. Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when interest payments are past due over 90 days. At September 30, 2023 , there were no floor plan receivables on nonaccrual status and the weighted-average age of the floor plan receivables was nine months. 6 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued Interest income from floor plan receivables is recognized on an accrual basis and is included in Interest Income in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Income Statements. Interest income for the three and six months ended September 30, 2023 was $ 0.3 million and $ 0.6 million, respectively. There were no floor plan receivables as of October 1, 2022 or related interest income for the three and six months then ended. In May 2022, the Company acquired certain operating assets from Manis Custom Builders, Inc. (""Manis""). In July 2022, the Company acquired 12 Factory Expo retail sales centers from Alta Cima Corporation. The purchase price and net assets acquired for both transactions were not material to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. There were no accounting standards recently issued that are expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations. 2. Inventories, net The components of inventory, net of reserves for obsolete inventory, were as follows: (Dollars in thousands) September 30, 2023 April 1, 2023 Raw materials $ 92,121 $ 100,379 Work in process 21,239 23,157 Finished goods and other 68,879 78,702 Total inventories, net $ 182,239 $ 202,238 At September 30, 2023 and April 1, 2023, reserves for obsolete inventory were $ 9.1 million and $ 7.9 million , respectively. 3. Property, Plant, and Equipment Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated primarily on a straight-line basis, generally over the following estimated useful lives: land improvements – 3 to 10 years; buildings and improvements – 8 to 25 years ; and vehicles and machinery and equipment – 3 to 8 years . Depreciation expense for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022 was $ 4.7 million and $ 4.2 million , respectively. Depreciation expense for the six months ended September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022 was $ 9.3 million and $ 7.8 million , respectively. The components of property, plant, and equipment were as follows: (Dollars in thousands) September 30, 2023 April 1, 2023 Land and improvements $ 42,676 $ 41,749 Buildings and improvements 131,386 119,226 Machinery and equipment 100,694 91,007 Construction in progress 31,035 30,010 Property, plant, and equipment, at cost 305,791 281,992 Less: accumulated depreciation ( 114,025 ) ( 104,867 ) Property, plant, and equipment, net $ 191,766 $ 177,125 7 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued 4. Goodwill, Intangible Assets, and Cloud Computing Arrangements Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. At both September 30, 2023 and April 1, 2023, the Company had goodwill of $ 196.6 million . At September 30, 2023, there were no accumulated impairment losses related to goodwill. Intangible Assets The components of amortizable intangible assets were as follows: (Dollars in thousands) September 30, 2023 April 1, 2023 Customer Relationships & Other Trade Names Total Customer Relationships & Other Trade Names Total Gross carrying amount $ 66,019 $ 21,499 $ 87,518 $ 66,013 $ 21,497 $ 87,510 Accumulated amortization ( 36,200 ) ( 11,019 ) ( 47,219 ) ( 32,103 ) ( 10,064 ) ( 42,167 ) Amortizable intangibles, net $ 29,819 $ 10,480 $ 40,299 $ 33,910 $ 11,433 $ 45,343 During the three months ended September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022, amortization of intangible assets was $ 2.1 million and $ 2.8 million , respectively. During the six months ended September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022, amortization of intangible assets was $ 5.0 million and $ 4.7 million , respectively. Cloud Computing Arrangements The Company capitalizes costs associated with the development of cloud computing arrangements in a manner consistent with internally developed software. At September 30, 2023 and April 1, 2023, the Company had capitalized cloud computing costs, net of amortization of $ 25.7 million and $ 25.0 million , respectively. Cloud computing costs are included in other noncurrent assets in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. Amortization of capitalized cloud computing costs for the three and six months ended September 30, 2023 was $ 0.2 million and $ 0.4 million , respectively. Amortization of capitalized cloud computing costs for the three and six months ended October 1, 2022 was $ 0.2 million and $ 0.4 million , respectively . 5. Investment in ECN Capital Corporation In September 2023, the Company entered into a share subscription agreement with ECN Capital Corp. (""ECN"") and made a $ 137.8 million equity investment in ECN on a private placement basis. The Company purchased 33.6 million common shares, representing approximately 12 % of the total outstanding common shares of ECN, and 27.5 million mandatory convertible preferred shares (the “Preferred Shares”). The Preferred Shares receive cumulative cash dividends at an annual rate of 4.0 %. Following the private placement, the Company owns approximately 19.9 % of the voting shares of ECN. The Company's interest in the common stock investment in ECN is accounted for under the equity method and the Company’s share of the earnings or losses of ECN are recorded on a three-month lag. For the three and six months ended September 30, 2023, there were no earnings or losses recognized related to the equity method investment. At September 30, 2023, the investment in the common stock of ECN totaled $ 78.9 million, including $ 3.1 million of capitalized transaction costs, and is included in Other Noncurrent Assets in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company's investment in the Preferred Shares is included in Other Noncurrent Assets in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The investment is measured using the measurement alternative for equity investments without a readily determinable fair value. The carrying amount of $ 64.5 million at September 30, 2023 represents the purchase price and capitalized transaction costs of $ 2.5 million. There have been no adjustments to the carrying amount or impairment of the investment. Amounts due to ECN, a related party, were not material at September 30, 2023. ECN, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Triad Financial Services, Inc. (""Triad"") provides loan servicing for the Company's floor plan receivables, for which we pay a fee that was immaterial for the period subsequent to the investment in ECN. Triad also provides floor plan financing of the Company's products to independent retailers. At September 30, 2023, the Company had repurchase commitments on retailer floor plan loans outstanding with Triad of $ 55.7 million. 8 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued 6.

The Amended Credit Agreement allows the Company to draw down, repay and re-draw loans on the available facility during the term, subject to certain terms and conditions, matures in July 2026 , and has no scheduled amortization. On May 18, 2023, the Company further amended the Amended Credit Agreement, which removed references to the London Interbank Offer Rate (""LIBOR"") and clarified language pertaining to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (""SOFR"") in regards to the interest rate on borrowings. The interest rate on borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement is based on SOFR plus a SOFR adjustment, plus an interest rate spread. The interest rate spread adjusts based on the consolidated total net leverage of the Company from a high of 1.875 % when the consolidated total net leverage ratio is equal to or greater than 2.25 :1.00, to a low of 1.125 % when the consolidated total net leverage ratio is below 0.50:1.00. Alternatively for same day borrowings, the interest rate is based on an Alternative Base Rate (""ABR"") plus an interest rate spread that ranges from a high of 0.875 % to a low of 0.125 % based on the consolidated total net leverage ratio. In addition, the Company is obligated to pay an unused line fee ranging between 0.15 % and 0.3 % depending on the consolidated total net leverage ratio, in respect of unused commitments under the Amended Credit Agreement. At September 30, 2023 the interest rate under the Amended Credit Agreement 9 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued was 6.54 % and letters of credit issued under the Amended Credit Agreement totaled $ 34.0 million. Available borrowing capacity under the Amended Credit Agreement as of September 30, 2023 was $ 166.0 million. Obligations under industrial revenue bonds are supported by letters of credit and bear interest based on a municipal bond index rate. The weighted-average interest rate at September 30, 2023, including related costs and fees, was 5.62 %. T he industrial revenue bonds require lump-sum payments of principal upon maturity in 2029 and are secured by the assets of certain manufacturing facilities. The Amended Credit Agreement contains covenants that restrict the amount of additional debt, liens and certain payments, including equity buybacks, investments, dispositions, mergers and consolidations, among other restrictions as defined. The Company was in compliance with all covenants of the Amended Credit Agreement as of September 30, 2023 . 9.

Income Taxes For the three months ended September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022, the Company recorded $ 14.8 million and $ 48.1 million of income tax expense and had an effective tax rate of 24.5 % and 25.0 % , respectively. For the six months ended September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022, the Company recorded $ 32.0 million and $ 88.5 million of income tax expense and had an effective tax rate of 24.8 % and 25.3 % , respectively. The Company’s effective tax rate for the three and six months ended September 30, 2023 differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of 21.0 % due primarily to the effect of state and local income taxes, non-deductible expenses, tax credits, and results in foreign jurisdictions. The Company’s effective tax rate for the three and six months ended October 1, 2022 differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of 21.0 % due primarily to the effect of state and local income taxes, non-deductible expenses, tax credits, and results in foreign jurisdictions. At September 30, 2023 , the Company had no unrecognized tax benefits. 11. Earnings Per Share Basic net income per share attributable to the Company was computed by dividing net income attributable to the Company by the average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated using our weighted-average outstanding common shares, including the dilutive effect of stock awards as determined under the treasury stock method. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share: Three months ended Six months ended (Dollars and shares in thousands, except per share data) September 30, 2023 October 1, 2022 September 30, 2023 October 1, 2022 Numerator: Net income attributable to the Company's common shareholders $ 45,669 $ 144,092 $ 96,938 $ 261,243 Denominator: Basic weighted-average shares outstanding 57,232 56,956 57,224 56,933 Dilutive securities 492 450 471 431 Diluted weighted-average shares outstanding 57,724 57,406 57,695 57,364 Basic net income per share $ 0.80 $ 2.53 $ 1.69 $ 4.59 Diluted net income per share $ 0.79 $ 2.51 $ 1.68 $ 4.55 12. Segment Information Financial results for the Company's reportable segments have been prepared using a management approach, which is consistent with the basis and manner in which financial information is evaluated by the Company's chief operating decision maker in allocating resources and in assessing performance. The Company’s chief operating decision maker, the Chief Executive Officer, evaluates the performance of the Company’s segments primarily based on net sales, before elimination of inter-company shipments, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (“EBITDA”) and operating assets. The Company operates in two reportable segments: (i) U.S. Factory-built Housing, which includes manufacturing and retail housing operations and (ii) Canadian Factory-built Housing. Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation operations, corporate costs directly incurred for all segments and intersegment eliminations. Segments are generally determined by geography. Segment data includes intersegment revenues and corporate office costs that are directly and exclusively incurred for each segment. Total assets for Corporate/Other primarily include cash and certain U.S. deferred tax items not specifically allocated to another segment. 11 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued Selected financial information by reportable segment was as follows: Three months ended Six months ended (Dollars in thousands) September 30, 2023 October 1, 2022 September 30, 2023 October 1, 2022 Net sales: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 428,132 $ 754,237 $ 856,917 $ 1,415,318 Canadian Factory-built Housing 29,256 39,198 55,376 84,260 Corporate/Other 6,848 13,390 16,712 33,128 Consolidated net sales $ 464,236 $ 806,825 $ 929,005 $ 1,532,706 Operating income: U.S. Factory-built Housing EBITDA $ 64,752 $ 199,284 $ 138,985 $ 360,849 Canadian Factory-built Housing EBITDA 5,763 10,141 10,527 21,468 Corporate/Other EBITDA ( 13,759 ) ( 12,293 ) ( 25,930 ) ( 21,882 ) Other expense (income) 2,065 — 2,065 ( 634 ) Depreciation ( 4,700 ) ( 4,166 ) ( 9,333 ) ( 7,836 ) Amortization ( 2,086 ) ( 2,775 ) ( 5,045 ) ( 4,721 ) Consolidated operating income $ 52,035 $ 190,191 $ 111,269 $ 347,244 Depreciation: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 4,198 $ 3,505 $ 8,326 $ 6,542 Canadian Factory-built Housing 356 345 712 626 Corporate/Other 146 316 295 668 Consolidated depreciation $ 4,700 $ 4,166 $ 9,333 $ 7,836 Amortization of U.S. Factory-built Housing intangible assets: $ 2,086 $ 2,775 $ 5,045 $ 4,721 Capital expenditures: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 11,743 $ 14,778 $ 21,421 $ 23,711 Canadian Factory-built Housing 475 1,068 941 1,429 Corporate/Other 288 332 485 473 Consolidated capital expenditures $ 12,506 $ 16,178 $ 22,847 $ 25,613 (Dollars in thousands) September 30, 2023 April 1, 2023 Total Assets: U.S. Factory-built Housing (1) $ 697,547 $ 708,573 Canadian Factory-built Housing (1) 125,961 124,673 Corporate/Other (1) 845,667 729,478 Consolidated total assets $ 1,669,175 $ 1,562,724 13. Commitments, Contingencies, and Legal Proceedings Repurchase Contingencies and Guarantees The Company is contingently liable under terms of repurchase agreements with lending institutions that provide wholesale floor plan financing to retailers. These arrangements, which are customary in the manufactured housing industry, provide for the repurchase of products sold to retailers in the event of default by the retailer on its agreement to pay the financial institution. The risk of loss from these agreements is significantly reduced by the potential resale value of any products that are subject to repurchase and is spread over numerous retailers. The repurchase price is generally determined by the original sales price of the product less contractually defined curtailment payments. Based on these repurchase agreements and our historical loss experience, we established an associated loss reserve which was $ 2.0 million and $ 2.5 million at September 30, 2023 and April 1, 2023, respectively. Excluding the resale value of the homes, the contingent repurchase obligation as of September 30, 2023 was estimated to be $ 297.1 million . Losses incurred on homes repurchased were immaterial during the three and six months ended September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022. 12 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued At September 30, 2023, the Company was contingently obligated for $ 34.0 million under letters of credit, consisting of $ 12.6 million to support long-term debt, $ 21.1 million to support the casualty insurance program, and $ 0.3 million to support bonding agreements. The letters of credit are issued from a sub-facility of the Amended Credit Agreement. The Company was also contingently obl igated for $ 31.3 million und er surety bonds, generally to support performance on long-term construction contracts and license and service bonding requirements. The Company has received claims for damage related to water intrusion in homes built in one of its manufacturing facilities. The Company is investigating the cause of the damage and assessing its responsibility to remediate. While it is reasonably possible that the Company will receive future claims that could result in additional costs to repair that could be significant in the aggregate, the Company is unable to estimate the number of such claims or the amount or range of any potential losses associated with such claims at this time. In the normal course of business, the Company’s former subsidiaries that operated in the United Kingdom historically provided certain guarantees to two customers. Those guarantees provide contractual liability for proven construction defects up to 12 years from the date of delivery of certain products. The guarantees remain a contingent liability of the Company which declines over time through October 2027. As of the date of this report, the Company expects few, if any, claims to be reported under the terms of the guarantees. Legal Proceedings The Company has agreed to indemnify counterparties in the ordinary course of its business in agreements to acquire and sell business assets and in financing arrangements. The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of its business. As of the date of this filing, the Company believes the ultimate liability with respect to these contingent obligations will not have, either individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 14. Subsequent Event On October 13 , 2023, the Company acquired 100 % of the equity interests of Regional Enterprises, LLC and related companies (""Regional""). The purchase price (exclusive of working capital and earnout adjustments) is estimated to be $ 313 million, net of cash acquired, plus assumed debt, primarily related to inventory floor plan liabilities, of $ 93 million. The purchase price is subject to an earnout provision as well as customary net working capital adjustments. The Company funded the acquisition with cash on hand and $ 30 million of the Company’s common stock. Regional, the fourth largest HUD manufacturer in the United States, operates three manufacturing facilities in Alabama and 43 retail sales centers across the southeast U.S. The related acquisition costs, which are included in Other Expense (Income), Net in the Condensed Consolidated Income Statements, were $ 2.1 million during the three and six months ended September 30, 2023. The initial accounting for the business combination is incomplete at the time of this filing due to the limited amount of time since the acquisition date and the ongoing status of the valuation. Therefore, it is not practical for the Company to provide the major classes of assets acquired and liabilities assumed or pro forma revenue and earnings. 13 Item 2. MANAGEMENT’ S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following should be read in conjunction with Skyline Champion Corporation’s condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear in Item 1 of this Report. Overview Skyline Champion Corporation (the “Company”) is a leading producer of factory-built housing in the U.S. and Canada. The Company serves as a complete solutions provider across complementary and vertically integrated businesses including factory-built home manufacturing, company-owned retail locations, construction services, and transportation logistics services. The Company markets its homes under several nationally recognized brand names including Skyline Homes, Champion Home Builders, Genesis Homes, Athens Park Models, Dutch Housing, Atlantic Homes, Excel Homes, Homes of Merit, New Era, Redman Homes, ScotBilt Homes, Shore Park, Silvercrest, and Titan Homes in the U.S., and Moduline and SRI Homes in western Canada. The Company operates 39 manufacturing facilities throughout the U.S. and five manufacturing facilities in western Canada that primarily construct factory-built, timber-framed, manufactured and modular houses that are sold primarily to independent retailers, builders/developers, and manufactured home community operators. The Company’s retail operations consist of 31 sales centers that sell manufactured homes to consumers across the U.S. The Company’s transportation business engages independent owners/drivers to transport manufactured homes, recreational vehicles, and other products throughout the U.S. and Canada. Acquisitions and Expansions Over the last several years, demand for affordable housing in the U.S. has increased. As a result, the Company focused on operational improvements to increase capacity utilization and profitability at its existing manufacturing facilities as well as executed measured expansion of its manufacturing footprint through facility and equipment investments and acquisitions. During fiscal 2023, robust demand began to slow as inflation and higher interest rates made housing less affordable. Even though demand in the housing markets has returned to more normal levels recently, the Company continues to focus on growing in strong housing markets across the U.S. and Canada, as well as expanding products and services to provide more holistic solutions to homebuyers. In October 2023, the Company acquired Regional, which operates three manufacturing facilities in Alabama and 43 retail sales centers across the Southeast U.S. Regional's strong presence in large markets in the Southeast U.S. will help expand our captive retail and manufacturing distribution in the region. In July 2022, the Company acquired 12 Factory Expo retail sales centers from Alta Cima Corporation, which expanded the internal retail network across a broader portion of the U.S. In May 2022, the Company acquired Manis Custom Builders, Inc. (""Manis"") in order to expand its manufacturing footprint and further streamline its product offering in the Southeast U.S. In February 2021, the Company acquired ScotBilt Homes, LLC and related companies (collectively, ""Scotbilt""), which operated two manufacturing facilities in Georgia providing affordable housing throughout Alabama, Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas. The ScotBilt acquisition complemented the Company’s prior manufacturing footprint in the attractive mid-south region. In addition to those acquisitions, the Company is also focused on growing its U.S. manufacturing production capacity through various plant start-ups. The Company began production in a previously idled facility in Decatur, Indiana in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. In January 2021, the Company acquired two idle facilities in Pembroke, North Carolina, one of which began production in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. In June 2021, the Company acquired two idle facilities in Navasota, Texas and began production at one of those facilities during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. The Company is also in the process of opening a previously idled facility in Bartow, Florida, which is expected to begin production in fiscal 2024. In September 2023, the Company entered into a share subscription agreement with ECN Capital Corp. (""ECN"") in which the Company made a $137.8 million equity investment in ECN on a private placement basis to purchase 33.6 million common shares, representing approximately 12% of the total outstanding common shares of ECN, and 27.5 million mandatory convertible preferred shares. Following the private placement, the Company owns approximately 19.9% interest in ECN. In conjunction with the investment, the Company and ECN entered into a joint venture agreement to develop a captive finance company which allows us to leverage ECN's knowledge and systems to develop tailored dealer floor plan and retail consumer lending products which will facilitate further growth. The Company's acquisitions and investments are part of a strategy to grow and diversify revenue with a focus on increasing the Company’s home building presence in the U.S. as well as improving the results of operations through streamlining production of similar product categories. These acquisitions and investments are included in the Company's consolidated results for periods subsequent to their respective acquisition dates. Industry and Company Outlook Since July 2020, the U.S. and Canadian housing industry demand has generally been robust. The limited availability of existing homes for sale and the broader need for newly built affordable, single-family housing has driven demand for new homes in those markets. In recent years, manufactured home construction experienced revenue growth due to a number of favorable demographic trends and demand drivers in the U.S., including underlying growth trends in key homebuyer groups, such as the population over 55 years of age, the population of first-time 14 homebuyers, and the population of households earning less than $60,000 per year. More recently, we have seen a number of market trends pointing to increased sales of accessory dwelling units (""ADUs"") and urban-to-rural migration as customers accommodate working-from-home patterns, as well as people seeking rent-to-own single-family options. The rise in interest rates in response to inflation have impacted the demand for the Company's products in both the U.S. and Canada. In addition, many of our community customers have reduced order rates in response to excess inventory in their sales channels. As a result, the Company's backlog was $257.8 million as of September 30, 2023 compared to $814.0 million as of October 1, 2022. Cancellation of end-consumer orders, at the retail level, have been minimal. For the six months ended September 30, 2023, approximately 86% of the Company’s U.S. manufacturing sales were generated from the manufacture of homes that comply with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (""HUD"") code construction standard in the U.S. Industry shipments of HUD-code homes are reported on a one-month lag. According to data reported by the Manufactured Housing Institute, HUD-code industry home shipments were 22,984 and 30,130 units during the three months ended August 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Based on industry data, the Company’s U.S. wholesale market share of HUD code homes sold was 18.0% and 22.5%, for the three months ended August 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Annual HUD-code industry shipments have generally increased since calendar year 2009 when only 50,000 HUD-coded manufactured homes were shipped, the lowest level since the industry began recording statistics in 1959. While shipments of HUD-coded manufactured homes have improved modestly in recent years, manufactured housing’s most recent annual shipment levels still operate at lower levels than the long-term historical average of over 200,000 units annually. Manufactured home sales represent approximately 11% of all of U.S. single family home starts. Our market share in the U.S. total housing market was approximately 2.0% for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023. UNAUDITED INCOME STATEMENTS FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2024 VS. 2023 Three months ended (Dollars in thousands) September 30, 2023 October 1, 2022 Income Statements Data: Net sales $ 464,236 $ 806,825 Cost of sales 347,747 532,719 Gross profit 116,489 274,106 Selling, general, and administrative expenses 64,454 83,915 Operating income 52,035 190,191 Interest (income), net (10,480 ) (1,974 ) Other expense 2,065 — Income before income taxes 60,450 192,165 Income tax expense 14,781 48,073 Net income $ 45,669 $ 144,092 Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA: Net income $ 45,669 $ 144,092 Income tax expense 14,781 48,073 Interest (income), net (10,480 ) (1,974 ) Depreciation and amortization 6,786 6,941 Transaction costs 2,065 — Adjusted EBITDA $ 58,821 $ 197,132 As a percent of net sales: Gross profit 25.1 % 34.0 % Selling, general, and administrative expenses 13.9 % 10.4 % Operating income 11.2 % 23.6 % Net income 9.8 % 17.9 % Adjusted EBITDA 12.7 % 24.4 % 15 NET SALES The following table summarizes net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022: Three months ended (Dollars in thousands) September 30, 2023 October 1, 2022 $ Change % Change Net sales $ 464,236 $ 806,825 $ (342,589 ) (42.5 %) U.S. manufacturing and retail net sales $ 428,132 $ 754,237 $ (326,105 ) (43.2 %) U.S. homes sold 4,842 7,274 (2,432 ) (33.4 %) U.S. manufacturing and retail average home selling price $ 88.4 $ 103.7 $ (15.3 ) (14.8 %) Canadian manufacturing net sales $ 29,256 $ 39,198 $ (9,942 ) (25.4 %) Canadian homes sold 232 303 (71 ) (23.4 %) Canadian manufacturing average home selling price $ 126.1 $ 129.4 $ (3.3 ) (2.6 %) Corporate/Other net sales $ 6,848 $ 13,390 $ (6,542 ) (48.9 %) U.S. manufacturing facilities in operation at end of period 39 37 U.S. retail sales centers in operation at end of period 31 31 Canadian manufacturing facilities in operation at end of period 5 5 Net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2023 were $464.2 million, a decrease of $342.6 million, or 42.5%, compared to the three months ended October 1, 2022. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. U.S. Factory-built Housing: Net sales for the Company’s U.S. manufacturing and retail operations decreased by $326.1 million, or 43.2%, for the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the three months ended October 1, 2022. The decrease was primarily due to a 33.4% decrease in the number of homes sold during the period, as well as a 14.8% decrease in the average home selling price. The decrease in the number of homes sold was due to lower customer demand and production volumes compared to the prior year. The average selling price decrease was due, in part, to the impact of disaster relief housing sales of $117.8 million to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (""FEMA"") in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, as well as customers choosing smaller homes with fewer or lower cost options on new homes, and decrease in material surcharges. FEMA units generally have more specifications than our typical products and therefore drive a higher average selling price per home. The decline in sales was partially offset by sales from the start-up of new plants. Canadian Factory-built Housing: The Canadian Factory-built Housing segment net sales decreased by $9.9 million, or 25.4% for the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year, primarily due to a 23.4% decrease in homes sold and a 2.6% decrease in average home selling price. The decrease in homes sold is due to slowing demand. We also reduced prices on certain models in order to respond to changes in demand. On a constant currency basis, net sales for the Canadian segment were unfavorably impacted by approximately $0.9 million due to fluctuations in the translation of the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar during the three months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. Corporate/Other: Net sales for Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation business and the elimination of intersegment sales. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, net sales decreased $6.5 million, or 48.9%, primarily attributable to the decrease in recreational vehicle shipments. 16 GROSS PROFIT The following table summarizes gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022: Three months ended (Dollars in thousands) September 30, 2023 October 1, 2022 $ Change % Change Gross profit: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 105,084 $ 256,744 $ (151,660 ) (59.1 %) Canadian Factory-built Housing 8,007 13,170 (5,163 ) (39.2 %) Corporate/Other 3,398 4,192 (794 ) (18.9 %) Total gross profit $ 116,489 $ 274,106 $ (157,617 ) (57.5 %) Gross profit as a percent of net sales 25.1 % 34.0 % Gross profit as a percent of sales during the three months ended September 30, 2023 was 25.1% compared to 34.0% during the three months ended October 1, 2022. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. U.S. Factory-built Housing: Gross profit for the U.S. Factory-built Housing segment decreased by $151.7 million, or 59.1%, during the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. Gross profit was 24.5% as a percent of segment net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared to 34.0% in the same period of the prior fiscal year. The decrease in gross profit as a percent of segment net sales is being driven by lower product prices, unit volume and changes in product mix including the decrease in FEMA sales which are generally at higher prices than our core products. Canadian Factory-built Housing: Gross profit for the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment decreased by $5.2 million, or 39.2%, during the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. The decrease in gross profit is primarily due to lower product prices, sales volumes and production. Gross profit as a percent of net sales was 27.4% for the three months ended September 30, 2023, compared to 33.6% in the same period of the prior year, primarily the result of decreased leverage of fixed manufacturing costs due to lower sales volumes. Corporate/Other: Gross profit for the Corporate/Other segment decreased $0.8 million, or 18.9%, during the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. Gross profit increased as a percent of segment net sales to 49.6% from 31.3% due to revenue mix in the Company's transportation business. SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Selling, general, and administrative expenses include foreign currency transaction gains and losses, equity compensation, and intangible amortization expense. The following table summarizes selling, general, and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022: Three months ended (Dollars in thousands) September 30, 2023 October 1, 2022 $ Change % Change Selling, general, and administrative expenses: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 46,614 $ 63,741 $ (17,127 ) (26.9 %) Canadian Factory-built Housing 2,600 3,373 (773 ) (22.9 %) Corporate/Other 15,240 16,801 (1,561 ) (9.3 %) Total selling, general, and administrative expenses $ 64,454 $ 83,915 $ (19,461 ) (23.2 %) Selling, general, and administrative expense as a percent of net sales 13.9 % 10.4 % Selling, general, and administrative expenses were $64.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of $19.5 million, or 23.2%, compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. 17 U.S. Factory-built Housing: Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the U.S. Factory-built Housing segment decreased $17.1 million, or 26.9%, during the three months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. Selling, general, and administrative expenses, as a percent of segment net sales increased to 10.9% for the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared to 8.5% during the comparable period of the prior fiscal year primarily due to lower sales volume in relation to certain fixed costs. The decrease in selling, general, and administrative expenses resulted from lower sales commissions and incentive compensation which is generally based on sales volume or a measure of profitability. Canadian Factory-built Housing: Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment decreased $0.8 million, or 22.9%, for the three months ended September 30, 2023 when compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. The decrease in selling, general, and administrative expenses is due primarily to incentive compensation which is based on sales volume and profitability. Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percent of segment net sales increased to 8.9% for the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared to 8.6% during the comparable period of the prior fiscal year due to less absorption of fixed costs caused by lower sales. Corporate/Other: Selling, general, and administrative expenses for Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation operations, corporate costs incurred for all segments, and intersegment eliminations. Selling, general, and administrative expenses for Corporate/Other decreased $1.6 million, or 9.3%, during the three months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year due primarily to lower incentive compensation offset in part by higher equity-based compensation. INTEREST (INCOME), NET The following table summarizes the components of interest (income) expense, net for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022: Three months ended (Dollars in thousands) September 30, 2023 October 1, 2022 $ Change % Change Interest expense $ 362 $ 992 $ (630 ) (63.5 %) Less: interest income (10,842 ) (2,966 ) (7,876 ) 265.5 % Interest (income), net $ (10,480 ) $ (1,974 ) $ (8,506 ) * Average outstanding floor plan payable $ — $ 37,086 Average outstanding long-term debt $ 12,430 $ 12,430 * indicates that the calculated percentage is not meaningful Interest income, net was $10.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $2.0 million in the same period of the prior fiscal year. The change was primarily due to higher interest income from higher average invested cash balances, higher interest rates earned on those cash balances, and the repayment of floor plan payables in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. OTHER EXPENSE (INCOME) The following table summarizes other income for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022: Three months ended (Dollars in thousands) September 30, 2023 October 1, 2022 $ Change % Change Other expense (income) $ 2,065 $ — $ 2,065 100.0 % Other expense of $2.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 represents transaction costs incurred for the acquisition of Regional. 18 INCOME TAX EXPENSE The following table summarizes income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022: Three months ended (Dollars in thousands) September 30, 2023 October 1, 2022 $ Change % Change Income tax expense $ 14,781 $ 48,073 $ (33,292 ) (69.3 %) Effective tax rate 24.5 % 25.0 % Income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was $14.8 million, representing an effective tax rate of 24.5%, compared to income tax expense of $48.1 million, representing an effective tax rate of 25.0% for the three months ended October 1, 2022. The Company’s effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2023 differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of 21.0% due primarily to the effect of state and local income taxes, non-deductible expenses, tax credits, and results in foreign jurisdictions. The Company’s effective tax rate for the three months ended October 1, 2022 differed from the federal statutory income tax rate of 21.0% due primarily to the effect of state and local income taxes, non-deductible expenses, tax credits, and results in foreign jurisdictions. ADJUSTED EBITDA The following table reconciles net income, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, to Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022: Three months ended (Dollars in thousands) September 30, 2023 October 1, 2022 $ Change % Change Net income $ 45,669 $ 144,092 $ (98,423 ) (68.3 %) Income tax expense 14,781 48,073 (33,292 ) (69.3 %) Interest (income), net (10,480 ) (1,974 ) (8,506 ) * Depreciation and amortization 6,786 6,941 (155 ) (2.2 %) Transaction costs 2,065 — 2,065 * Adjusted EBITDA $ 58,821 $ 197,132 $ (138,311 ) (70.2 %) * indicates that the calculated percentage is not meaningful Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was $58.8 million, a decrease of $138.3 million from the same period of the prior fiscal year. The decrease is primarily a result of lower operating income due to decreases in sales volume, average selling prices and gross margins, partially offset by lower SG&A expenses primarily related to incentive compensation on sales and profit levels. 19 UNAUDITED INCOME STATEMENTS FOR THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2024 VS. 2023 Six months ended (Dollars in thousands) September 30, 2023 October 1, 2022 Income Statements Data: Net sales $ 929,005 $ 1,532,706 Cost of sales 682,843 1,029,265 Gross profit 246,162 503,441 Selling, general, and administrative expenses 134,893 156,197 Operating income 111,269 347,244 Interest (income), net (19,781 ) (1,884 ) Other expense (income) 2,065 (634 ) Income before income taxes 128,985 349,762 Income tax expense 32,047 88,519 Net income $ 96,938 $ 261,243 Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA: Net income $ 96,938 $ 261,243 Income tax expense 32,047 88,519 Interest (income), net (19,781 ) (1,884 ) Depreciation and amortization 14,378 12,557 Transaction costs 2,065 338 Other — (973 ) Adjusted EBITDA $ 125,647 $ 359,800 As a percent of net sales: Gross profit 26.5 % 32.8 % Selling, general, and administrative expenses 14.5 % 10.2 % Operating income 12.0 % 22.7 % Net income 10.4 % 17.0 % Adjusted EBITDA 13.5 % 23.5 % NET SALES The following table summarizes net sales for the six months ended September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022: Six months ended (Dollars in thousands) September 30, 2023 October 1, 2022 $ Change % Change Net sales $ 929,005 $ 1,532,706 $ (603,701 ) (39.4 %) U.S. manufacturing and retail net sales $ 856,917 $ 1,415,318 $ (558,401 ) (39.5 %) U.S. homes sold 9,659 14,087 (4,428 ) (31.4 %) U.S. manufacturing and retail average home selling price $ 88.7 $ 100.5 $ (11.8 ) (11.7 %) Canadian manufacturing net sales $ 55,376 $ 84,260 $ (28,884 ) (34.3 %) Canadian homes sold 453 655 (202 ) (30.8 %) Canadian manufacturing average home selling price $ 122.2 $ 128.6 $ (6.4 ) (5.0 %) Corporate/Other net sales $ 16,712 $ 33,128 $ (16,416 ) (49.6 %) U.S. manufacturing facilities in operation at end of period 39 37 U.S. retail sales centers in operation at end of period 31 31 Canadian manufacturing facilities in operation at end of period 5 5 Net sales for the six months ended September 30, 2023 were $929.0 million, a decrease of $603.7 million, or 39.4%, compared to the six months ended October 1, 2022. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. U.S. Factory-built Housing: Net sales for the Company’s U.S. manufacturing and retail operations decreased by $558.4 million, or 39.5%, for the six months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the six months ended October 1, 2022. The decrease was primarily due to a 31.4% decrease in the number of homes sold during the period, as well as an 11.7% decrease in the average home selling price. The decrease in the number of homes sold was due to lower customer demand and lower production volume compared to the prior year. The average selling price decrease was due, in part, to 20 the impact of disaster relief housing sales of $200.3 million to FEMA in the first half of fiscal 2023, as well as customers choosing smaller homes with fewer or lower cost options and a reduction in material surcharges. FEMA units generally have more specifications than our typical products and therefore drive a higher average selling price per home. The decline in sales was partially offset by sales from the start-up of new plants. Canadian Factory-built Housing: The Canadian Factory-built Housing segment net sales decreased by $28.9 million, or 34.3% for the six months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year, primarily due to a 30.8% decrease in homes sold and a 5.0% decrease in average home selling price. The decrease in homes sold is due to slowing demand. We also reduced prices on certain models in order to respond to changes in demand. On a constant currency basis, net sales for the Canadian segment were unfavorably impacted by approximately $2.6 million due to fluctuations in the translation of the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar during the six months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. Corporate/Other: Net sales for Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation business and the elimination of intersegment sales. For the six months ended September 30, 2023, net sales decreased $16.4 million, or 49.6%, primarily attributable to the decrease in recreational vehicle shipments. GROSS PROFIT The following table summarizes gross profit for the six months ended September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022: Six months ended (Dollars in thousands) September 30, 2023 October 1, 2022 $ Change % Change Gross profit: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 223,508 $ 466,381 $ (242,873 ) (52.1 %) Canadian Factory-built Housing 15,035 27,965 (12,930 ) (46.2 %) Corporate/Other 7,619 9,095 (1,476 ) (16.2 %) Total gross profit $ 246,162 $ 503,441 $ (257,279 ) (51.1 %) Gross profit as a percent of net sales 26.5 % 32.8 % Gross profit as a percent of sales during the six months ended September 30, 2023 was 26.5% compared to 32.8% during the six months ended October 1, 2022. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. U.S. Factory-built Housing: Gross profit for the U.S. Factory-built Housing segment decreased by $242.9 million, or 52.1%, during the six months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. Gross profit was 26.1% as a percent of segment net sales for the six months ended September 30, 2023 compared to 33.0% in the same period of the prior fiscal year. The decrease in gross profit as a percent of segment net sales is being driven by lower unit volume and changes in product mix including the decrease in FEMA sales which are generally at higher prices than our core products. Canadian Factory-built Housing: Gross profit for the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment decreased by $12.9 million, or 46.2% during the six months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. The decrease in gross profit is primarily due to lower sales volumes and production. Gross profit as a percent of net sales was 27.2% for the six months ended September 30, 2023, compared to 33.2% in the same period of the prior year, primarily the result of decreased leverage of fixed manufacturing costs. Corporate/Other: Gross profit for the Corporate/Other segment decreased $1.5 million, or 16.2%, during the six months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. Gross profit increased as a percent of segment net sales to 45.6% from 27.5% due to revenue mix in the Company's transportation business. 21 SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Selling, general, and administrative expenses include foreign currency transaction gains and losses, equity compensation, and intangible amortization expense. The following table summarizes selling, general, and administrative expenses for the six months ended September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022: Six months ended (Dollars in thousands) September 30, 2023 October 1, 2022 $ Change % Change Selling, general, and administrative expenses: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 97,893 $ 116,795 $ (18,902 ) (16.2 %) Canadian Factory-built Housing 5,220 7,122 (1,902 ) (26.7 %) Corporate/Other 31,780 32,280 (500 ) (1.5 %) Total selling, general, and administrative expenses $ 134,893 $ 156,197 $ (21,304 ) (13.6 %) Selling, general, and administrative expense as a percent of net sales 14.5 % 10.2 % Selling, general, and administrative expenses were $134.9 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of $21.3 million, or 13.6%, compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. U.S. Factory-built Housing: Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the U.S. Factory-built Housing segment decreased $18.9 million, or 16.2%, during the six months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. Selling, general, and administrative expenses, as a percent of segment net sales increased to 11.4% for the six months ended September 30, 2023 compared to 8.3% during the comparable period of the prior fiscal year primarily due to lower sales volume in relation to certain fixed costs and the investment in new plant operations and the acquisition of Factory Expo. The decrease in selling, general, and administrative expenses resulted from lower sales commissions and incentive compensation which is generally based on sales volume or a measure of profitability, partially offset by expenses for business acquired in fiscal 2023 and investments in new capacity. Canadian Factory-built Housing: Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment decreased $1.9 million, or 26.7%, for the six months ended September 30, 2023 when compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percent of segment net sales increased to 9.4% for the six months ended September 30, 2023 compared to 8.5% during the comparable period of the prior fiscal year due to less absorption of fixed costs caused by lower sales. The decrease in selling, general, and administrative expenses is due primarily to a reduction in incentive compensation which is based on sales volume and profitability. Corporate/Other: Selling, general, and administrative expenses for Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation operations, corporate costs incurred for all segments, and intersegment eliminations. Selling, general, and administrative expenses for Corporate/Other decreased $0.5 million, or 1.5%, during the six months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year due primarily to lower incentive compensation, more favorable currency translation adjustments for Canadian denominated cash offset in part by higher equity-based compensation. 22 INTEREST (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET The following table summarizes the components of interest (income) expense, net for the six months ended September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022: Six months ended (Dollars in thousands) September 30, 2023 October 1, 2022 $ Change % Change Interest expense $ 739 $ 1,895 $ (1,156 ) (61.0 %) Less: interest income (20,520 ) (3,779 ) (16,741 ) * Interest (income), net $ (19,781 ) $ (1,884 ) $ (17,897 ) * Average outstanding floor plan payable $ — $ 37,522 Average outstanding long-term debt $ 12,430 $ 12,430 * indicates that the calculated percentage is not meaningful Interest income, net was $19.8 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $1.9 million in the same period of the prior fiscal year. The change was primarily due to higher interest income from higher average invested cash balances and higher interest rates earned on those cash balances, as well as lower interest expense due to the repayment of floor plan payables in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. OTHER EXPENSE (INCOME) The following table summarizes other income for the six months ended September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022: Six months ended (Dollars in thousands) September 30, 2023 October 1, 2022 $ Change % Change Other expense (income) $ 2,065 $ (634 ) $ 2,699 (425.7 %) Other expense of $2.1 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023 represents transaction costs incurred for the acquisition of Regional. Other income of $0.6 million for the six months ended October 1, 2022 was a result of insurance proceeds for partial settlement of certain Champion Home Builders’ pre-bankruptcy workers compensation claims, which was partially offset by transaction costs incurred for the acquisition of Manis. INCOME TAX EXPENSE The following table summarizes income tax expense for the six months ended September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022: Six months ended (Dollars in thousands) September 30, 2023 October 1, 2022 $ Change % Change Income tax expense $ 32,047 $ 88,519 $ (56,472 ) (63.8 %) Effective tax rate 24.8 % 25.3 % Income tax expense for the six months ended September 30, 2023 was $32.0 million, representing an effective tax rate of 24.8%, compared to income tax expense of $88.5 million, representing an effective tax rate of 25.3% for the six months ended October 1, 2022. The Company’s effective tax rate for the six months ended September 30, 2023 differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of 21.0% due primarily to the effect of state and local income taxes, non-deductible expenses, tax credits, and results in foreign jurisdictions. The Company’s effective tax rate for the six months ended October 1, 2022 differed from the federal statutory income tax rate of 21.0% due primarily to the effect of state and local income taxes, non-deductible expenses, tax credits, and results in foreign jurisdictions. ADJUSTED EBITDA The following table reconciles net income, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, to Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the six months ended September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022: 23 Six months ended (Dollars in thousands) September 30, 2023 October 1, 2022 $ Change % Change Net income $ 96,938 $ 261,243 $ (164,305 ) (62.9 %) Income tax expense 32,047 88,519 (56,472 ) (63.8 %) Interest (income), net (19,781 ) (1,884 ) (17,897 ) * Depreciation and amortization 14,378 12,557 1,821 14.5 % Transaction costs 2,065 338 1,727 * Other — (973 ) 973 * Adjusted EBITDA $ 125,647 $ 359,800 $ (234,153 ) (65.1 %) * indicates that the calculated percentage is not meaningful Adjusted EBITDA for the six months ended September 30, 2023 was $125.6 million, a decrease of $234.2 million from the same period of the prior fiscal year. The decrease is primarily a result of lower operating income due to decreases in sales volume, average selling prices and gross margins, partially offset by lower SG&A expenses. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss plus expense or minus income: (a) the provision for income taxes; (b) interest (income) expense, net; (c) depreciation and amortization; (d) gain or loss from discontinued operations; (e) non-cash restructuring charges and impairment of assets; and (f) other non-operating income and costs, including but not limited to those costs for the acquisition and integration or disposition of businesses and idle facilities. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of earnings calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income or loss, net sales, operating income or earnings per share prepared on a U.S. GAAP basis. Adjusted EBITDA does not purport to represent cash flow provided by, or used in, operating activities as defined by U.S. GAAP, which is presented in the Statement of Cash Flows. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is presented as a supplemental measure of the Company’s financial performance that management believes is useful to investors, because the excluded items may vary significantly in timing or amounts and/or may obscure trends useful in evaluating and comparing the Company’s operating activities across reporting periods. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA is useful to an investor in evaluating operating performance for the following reasons: (i) Adjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors to measure a company’s operating performance without regard to items such as interest income and expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization and equity-based compensation, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and the book value of assets, capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired; and (ii) analysts and investors use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to evaluate the overall operating performance of companies in the industry. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA for planning purposes, including the preparation of internal annual operating budget and periodic forecasts: (i) in communications with the Board of Directors and investors concerning financial performance; (ii) as a factor in determining bonuses under certain incentive compensation programs; and (iii) as a measure of operating performance used to determine the ability to provide cash flows to support investments in capital assets, acquisitions and working capital requirements for operating expansion. BACKLOG Although orders from customers can be canceled at any time without penalty, and unfilled orders are not necessarily an indication of future business, the Company’s unfilled U.S. and Canadian manufacturing orders at September 30, 2023 totaled $257.8 million compared to $814.0 million at October 1, 2022. The decrease in backlog is due to the reduction in overall housing demand. In addition, many of our community customers have reduced order rates in response to excess inventory in their sales channels. Cancellation of end-customer orders, at the retail level, has been minimal. 24 Liquidity and Capital Resources Sources and Uses of Cash The following table presents summary cash flow information for the six months ended September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022: Six months ended (Dollars in thousands) September 30, 2023 October 1, 2022 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 129,138 $ 278,566 Investing activities (174,639 ) (32,291 ) Financing activities (758 ) 2,260 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents (39 ) (6,944 ) Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents (46,298 ) 241,591 Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period 747,453 435,413 Cash and cash equivalents at end of period $ 701,155 $ 677,004 The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and existing cash balances. Cash balances and cash flows from operations for the next year are expected to be adequate to cover working capital requirements, capital expenditures, and strategic initiatives and investments. The Company has an Amended Credit Agreement which provides for a $200.0 million revolving credit facility, including a $45.0 million letter of credit sub-facility. At September 30, 2023, $166.0 million was available for borrowing under the Amended Credit Agreement. The Company’s revolving credit facility includes (i) a maximum consolidated total net leverage ratio of 3.25 to 1.00, subject to an upward adjustment upon the consummation of a material acquisition, and (ii) a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.00 to 1.00. The Company anticipates compliance with its debt covenants and projects its level of cash availability to be in excess of cash needed to operate the business for the next year and beyond. In the event operating cash flow and existing cash balances were deemed inadequate to support the Company’s liquidity needs, and one or more capital resources were to become unavailable, the Company would revise its operating strategies. Cash provided by operating activities was $129.1 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023 compared to $278.6 million for the six months ended October 1, 2022. The decrease was primarily driven by lower net income in fiscal 2024, partially offset by more favorable changes in working capital items during the first six months of fiscal 2024. Cash used in investing activities was $174.6 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023 compared to $32.3 million for the six months ended October 1, 2022. The increase in cash used for investing activities was related to the Company's investment in ECN common and preferred stock in fiscal 2024 and the Company's investment in floor plan loans in fiscal 2024, net of payments received. Cash used in financing activities was $0.8 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023 compared to cash provided by financing activities of $2.3 million for the six months ended October 1, 2022. The change in cash between periods was primarily due to borrowings on floor plan financing in fiscal 2023 that did not reoccur in fiscal 2024.

See accompanying Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 5 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consoli dated Financial Statements 1. Basis of Presentation and Business Nature of Operations: Skyline Champion Corporation's (the “Company”) operations consist of manufacturing, retail, construction services, and transportation activities. At July 1, 2023, the Company operated 39 manufacturing facilities throughout the United States (“U.S.”) and five manufacturing facilities in western Canada that primarily construct factory-built, timber-framed manufactured and modular houses that are sold primarily to independent retailers, builders/developers, and manufactured home community operators. In addition to its core home building business, the Company provides construction services to install and set-up factory-built homes. The Company’s retail operations consist of 31 sales centers that sell manufactured houses to consumers across the U.S. The Company’s transportation business engages independent owners/drivers to transport recreational vehicles throughout the U.S. and Canada and manufactured houses in certain regions of the U.S. The Company also has a holding company located in the Netherlands. Basis of Presentation: The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) for Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Article 10 of SEC Regulation S-X. Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“U.S. GAAP”) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany balances and transactions. In the opinion of management, these statements include all normal recurring adjustments necessary to fairly state the Company’s consolidated results of operations, cash flows, and financial position. The Company has evaluated subsequent events after the balance sheet date through the date of the filing of this report with the SEC. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the SEC on May 30, 2023 (the “Fiscal 2023 Annual Report”). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The condensed consolidated income statements, condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income, and condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations or cash flows for the full year. The Company’s fiscal year is a 52- or 53-week period that ends on the Saturday nearest to March 31. The Company’s current fiscal year, “fiscal 2024,” will end on March 30, 2024 and will include 52 weeks. References to “fiscal 2023” refer to the Company’s fiscal year ended April 1, 2023. The three months ended July 1, 2023 and July 2, 2022 each included 13 weeks. The Company’s allowance for credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost reflects management’s estimate of credit losses over the remaining expected life of such assets, measured primarily using historical experience, as well as current economic conditions and forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. Expected credit losses for newly recognized financial assets, as well as changes to expected credit losses during the period, are recognized in earnings. Accounts receivable are reflected net of reserves of $ 2.8 million and $ 1.7 million at July 1, 2023 and April 1, 2023, respectively. Floor plan receivables consist of $ 18.5 million of loans the Company purchased from an independent financial institution in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, which the Company intends to hold until maturity or payoff, and amounts loaned by the Company through the independent financial institution to certain independent retailers for purchases of homes manufactured and sold by the Company, both of which are carried net of payments received and recorded at amortized cost. These loans are serviced by the financial institution for which we pay a servicing fee. Upon execution of the financing arrangement, the loans are generally payable at the earlier of the sale of the underlying home or two years from the origination date. At July 1, 2023, Floor Plan Receivables are included in Other Current Assets and Other Noncurrent Assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The floor plan receivables are collateralized by the related homes, mitigating loss exposure. The Company and the financial institution evaluate the credit worthiness of each independent retailer prior to credit approval, including reviewing the independent retailer’s payment history, financial condition, and overall economic environment. We evaluate the risk of credit loss in aggregate on existing loans with similar terms, based on historic experience and current economic conditions, as well as individual retailers with past due balances or other indications of heightened credit risk. The allowance for credit losses related to floor plan receivables was not material as of July 1, 2023. Loans are considered past due if any required interest or curtailment payment remains unpaid 30 days after the due date. Receivables are placed on non-performing status if any interest or installment payments are past due over 90 days. Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when interest payments are past due over 90 days. At July 1, 2023, there were no floor plan receivables on nonaccrual status and the weighted-average age of the floor plan receivables was nine months. 6 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued Interest income from floor plan receivables is recognized on an accrual basis and is included in Interest Income in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Income Statements. Interest income for the three months ended July 1, 2023 was $ 0.3 million. There were no floor plan receivables as of July 2, 2022 or interest income for the three months then ended. In May 2022, the Company acquired certain operating assets from Manis Custom Builders, Inc. (""Manis""). In July 2022, the Company acquired 12 Factory Expo retail sales centers from Alta Cima Corporation. The purchase price and net assets acquired for both transactions were not material to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. There were no accounting standards recently issued that are expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations. 2. Inventories, net The components of inventory, net of reserves for obsolete inventory, were as follows: (Dollars in thousands) July 1, 2023 April 1, 2023 Raw materials $ 95,137 $ 100,379 Work in process 24,715 23,157 Finished goods and other 76,658 78,702 Total inventories, net $ 196,510 $ 202,238 At July 1, 2023 and April 1, 2023, reserves for obsolete inventory were $ 9.1 million and $ 7.9 million , respectively. 3. Property, Plant, and Equipment Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated primarily on a straight-line basis, generally over the following estimated useful lives: land improvements – 3 to 10 years; buildings and improvements – 8 to 25 years ; and vehicles and machinery and equipment – 3 to 8 years . Depreciation expense for the three months ended July 1, 2023 and July 2, 2022 was $ 4.6 million and $ 3.7 million , respectively. The components of property, plant, and equipment were as follows: (Dollars in thousands) July 1, 2023 April 1, 2023 Land and improvements $ 42,079 $ 41,749 Buildings and improvements 123,799 119,226 Machinery and equipment 96,094 91,007 Construction in progress 31,896 30,010 Property, plant, and equipment, at cost 293,868 281,992 Less: accumulated depreciation ( 109,609 ) ( 104,867 ) Property, plant, and equipment, net $ 184,259 $ 177,125 7 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued 4. Goodwill, Intangible Assets, and Cloud Computing Arrangements Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination.

Cloud Computing Arrangements The Company capitalizes costs associated with the development of cloud computing arrangements in a manner consistent with internally developed software. At July 1, 2023 and April 1, 2023, the Company had capitalized cloud computing costs, net of amortization of $ 24.9 million and $ 25.0 million , respectively. Cloud computing costs are included in other noncurrent assets in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. Amortization of capitalized cloud computing costs for both the three months ended July 1, 2023 and July 2, 2022 was $ 0.2 million . 5. Other Current Liabilities The components of other current liabilities were as follows: (Dollars in thousands) July 1, 2023 April 1, 2023 Customer deposits $ 64,768 $ 69,285 Accrued volume rebates 25,080 25,084 Accrued warranty obligations 27,705 28,576 Accrued compensation and payroll taxes 31,172 41,422 Accrued insurance 15,973 15,075 Other 34,028 24,773 Total other current liabilities $ 198,726 $ 204,215 8 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued 6. Accrued Warranty Obligations Changes in the accrued warranty obligations were as follows: Three months ended (Dollars in thousands) July 1, 2023 July 2, 2022 Balance at beginning of period $ 35,961 $ 32,832 Warranty expense 12,856 11,921 Cash warranty payments ( 13,727 ) ( 11,598 ) Balance at end of period 35,090 33,155 Less: noncurrent portion in other long-term liabilities ( 7,385 ) ( 7,026 ) Total current portion $ 27,705 $ 26,129 7. Debt Long-term debt consisted of the following: (Dollars in thousands) July 1, 2023 April 1, 2023 Obligations under industrial revenue bonds due 2029 $ 12,430 $ 12,430 Revolving credit facility maturing in 2026 — — Total long-term debt $ 12,430 $ 12,430 On July 7, 2021, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with a syndicate of banks that provides for a revolving credit facility of up to $ 200.0 million, including a $ 45.0 million letter of credit sub-facility (""Amended Credit Agreement""). The Amended Credit Agreement replaced the Company's previously existing $ 100.0 million revolving credit facility. The Amended Credit Agreement allows the Company to draw down, repay and re-draw loans on the available facility during the term, subject to certain terms and conditions, matures in July 2026 , and has no scheduled amortization. On May 18, 2023, the Company further amended the Amended Credit Agreement, which removed references to the London Interbank Offer Rate (""LIBOR"") and clarified language pertaining to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (""SOFR"") in regards to the interest rate on borrowings. The interest rate on borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement is based on SOFR plus a SOFR adjustment, plus an interest rate spread. The interest rate spread adjusts based on the consolidated total net leverage of the Company from a high of 1.875 % when the consolidated total net leverage ratio is equal to or greater than 2.25 :1.00, to a low of 1.125 % when the consolidated total net leverage ratio is below 0.50:1.00. Alternatively for same day borrowings, the interest rate is based on an Alternative Base Rate (""ABR"") plus an interest rate spread that ranges from a high of 0.875 % to a low of 0.125 % based on the consolidated total net leverage ratio. In addition, the Company is obligated to pay an unused line fee ranging between 0.15 % and 0.3 % depending on the consolidated total net leverage ratio, in respect of unused commitments under the Amended Credit Agreement. At July 1, 2023 the interest rate under the Amended Credit Agreement was 6.36 % and letters of credit issued under the Amended Credit Agreement totaled $ 34.0 million. Available borrowing capacity under the Amended Credit Agreement as of July 1, 2023 was $ 166.0 million. Obligations under industrial revenue bonds are supported by letters of credit and bear interest based on a municipal bond index rate. The weighted-average interest rate at July 1, 2023, including related costs and fees, was 5.61 %. T he industrial revenue bonds require lump-sum payments of principal upon maturity in 2029 and are secured by the assets of certain manufacturing facilities. 9 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued The Amended Credit Agreement contains covenants that restrict the amount of additional debt, liens and certain payments, including equity buybacks, investments, dispositions, mergers and consolidations, among other restrictions as defined. The Company was in compliance with all covenants of the Amended Credit Agreement as of July 1, 2023 . 8.

Earnings Per Share Basic net income per share attributable to the Company was computed by dividing net income attributable to the Company by the average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated using our weighted-average outstanding common shares, including the dilutive effect of stock awards as determined under the treasury stock method. 10 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share: Three months ended (Dollars and shares in thousands, except per share data) July 1, 2023 July 2, 2022 Numerator: Net income attributable to the Company's common shareholders $ 51,269 $ 117,151 Denominator: Basic weighted-average shares outstanding 57,183 56,910 Dilutive securities 475 387 Diluted weighted-average shares outstanding 57,658 57,297 Basic net income per share $ 0.90 $ 2.06 Diluted net income per share $ 0.89 $ 2.04 11. Segment Information Financial results for the Company's reportable segments have been prepared using a management approach, which is consistent with the basis and manner in which financial information is evaluated by the Company's chief operating decision maker in allocating resources and in assessing performance. The Company’s chief operating decision maker, the Chief Executive Officer, evaluates the performance of the Company’s segments primarily based on net sales, before elimination of inter-company shipments, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (“EBITDA”) and operating assets. The Company operates in two reportable segments: (i) U.S. Factory-built Housing, which includes manufacturing and retail housing operations and (ii) Canadian Factory-built Housing. Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation operations, corporate costs directly incurred for all segments and intersegment eliminations. Segments are generally determined by geography. Segment data includes intersegment revenues and corporate office costs that are directly and exclusively incurred for each segment. Total assets for Corporate/Other primarily include cash and certain U.S. deferred tax items not specifically allocated to another segment. 11 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued Selected financial information by reportable segment was as follows: Three months ended (Dollars in thousands) July 1, 2023 July 2, 2022 Net sales: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 428,785 $ 661,081 Canadian Factory-built Housing 26,120 45,062 Corporate/Other 9,864 19,738 Consolidated net sales $ 464,769 $ 725,881 Operating income: U.S. Factory-built Housing EBITDA $ 74,233 $ 161,565 Canadian Factory-built Housing EBITDA 4,764 11,327 Corporate/Other EBITDA ( 12,171 ) ( 9,589 ) Other (income) — ( 634 ) Depreciation ( 4,633 ) ( 3,670 ) Amortization ( 2,959 ) ( 1,946 ) Consolidated operating income $ 59,234 $ 157,053 Depreciation: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 4,128 $ 3,037 Canadian Factory-built Housing 356 281 Corporate/Other 149 352 Consolidated depreciation $ 4,633 $ 3,670 Amortization of U.S. Factory-built Housing intangible assets: $ 2,959 $ 1,946 Capital expenditures: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 9,678 $ 8,933 Canadian Factory-built Housing 466 361 Corporate/Other 197 141 Consolidated capital expenditures $ 10,341 $ 9,435 (Dollars in thousands) July 1, 2023 April 1, 2023 Total Assets: U.S. Factory-built Housing (1) $ 691,008 $ 708,573 Canadian Factory-built Housing (1) 129,233 124,673 Corporate/Other (1) 797,418 729,478 Consolidated total assets $ 1,617,659 $ 1,562,724 12. Commitments, Contingencies, and Legal Proceedings Repurchase Contingencies and Guarantees The Company is contingently liable under terms of repurchase agreements with lending institutions that provide wholesale floor plan financing to retailers. These arrangements, which are customary in the manufactured housing industry, provide for the repurchase of products sold to retailers in the event of default by the retailer on its agreement to pay the financial institution. The risk of loss from these agreements is significantly reduced by the potential resale value of any products that are subject to repurchase and is spread over numerous retailers. The repurchase price is generally determined by the original sales price of the product less contractually defined curtailment payments. Based on these repurchase agreements and our historical loss experience, we established an associated loss reserve which was $ 2.2 million and $ 2.5 million at July 1, 2023 and April 1, 2023, respectively. Excluding the resale value of the homes, the contingent repurchase obligation as of July 1, 2023 was estimated to be $ 333.7 million . Losses incurred on homes repurchased were immaterial during the three months ended July 1, 2023 and July 2, 2022. 12 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued At July 1, 2023 , the Company was contingently obligated for $ 34.0 million under letters of credit, consisting of $ 12.6 million to support long-term debt, $ 21.1 million to support the casualty insurance program, and $ 0.3 million to support bonding agreements. The letters of credit are issued from a sub-facility of the Amended Credit Agreement. The Company was also contingently obligated for $ 31.2 million under surety bonds, generally to support performance on long-term construction contracts and license and service bonding requirements. The Company has received claims for damage related to water intrusion in homes built in one of its manufacturing facilities. The Company is investigating the cause of the damage and assessing its responsibility to remediate. While it is reasonably possible that the Company will receive future claims that could result in additional costs to repair that could be significant in the aggregate, the Company is unable to estimate the number of such claims or the amount or range of any potential losses associated with such claims at this time. In the normal course of business, the Company’s former subsidiaries that operated in the United Kingdom historically provided certain guarantees to two customers. Those guarantees provide contractual liability for proven construction defects up to 12 years from the date of delivery of certain products. The guarantees remain a contingent liability of the Company which declines over time through October 2027. As of the date of this report, the Company expects few, if any, claims to be reported under the terms of the guarantees. Legal Proceedings The Company has agreed to indemnify counterparties in the ordinary course of its business in agreements to acquire and sell business assets and in financing arrangements. The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of its business. As of the date of this filing, the Company believes the ultimate liability with respect to these contingent obligations will not have, either individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 13 Item 2. MANAGEMENT’ S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following should be read in conjunction with Skyline Champion Corporation’s condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear in Item 1 of this Report. Overview Skyline Champion Corporation (the “Company”) is a leading producer of factory-built housing in the U.S. and Canada. The Company serves as a complete solutions provider across complementary and vertically integrated businesses including manufactured construction, company-owned retail locations, construction services, and transportation logistics services. The Company markets its homes under several nationally recognized brand names including Skyline Homes, Champion Home Builders, Genesis Homes, Athens Park Models, Dutch Housing, Atlantic Homes, Excel Homes, Homes of Merit, New Era, Redman Homes, ScotBilt Homes, Shore Park, Silvercrest, and Titan Homes in the U.S., and Moduline and SRI Homes in western Canada. The Company operates 39 manufacturing facilities throughout the U.S. and five manufacturing facilities in western Canada that primarily construct factory-built, timber-framed, manufactured and modular houses that are sold primarily to independent retailers, builders/developers, and manufactured home community operators. The Company’s retail operations consist of 31 sales centers that sell manufactured homes to consumers across the U.S. The Company’s transportation business engages independent owners/drivers to transport manufactured homes, recreational vehicles, and other products throughout the U.S. and Canada. Acquisitions and Expansions Over the last several years, demand for affordable housing in the U.S. has increased. As a result, the Company focused on operational improvements to increase capacity utilization and profitability at its existing manufacturing facilities as well as executed measured expansion of its manufacturing footprint through facility and equipment investments and acquisitions. During fiscal 2023, robust demand began to slow as inflation and higher interest rates made housing less affordable. Even though demand in the housing markets has normalized, the Company continues to focus on growing in strong housing markets across the U.S. and Canada, as well as expanding products and services to provide more holistic solutions to homebuyers. In July 2022, the Company acquired 12 Factory Expo retail sales centers from Alta Cima Corporation, which expanded the internal retail network across a broader portion of the U.S. In May 2022, the Company acquired Manis Custom Builders, Inc. (""Manis"") in order to expand its manufacturing footprint and further streamline its product offering in the Southeast U.S. In February 2021, the Company acquired ScotBilt Homes, LLC and related companies (collectively, ""Scotbilt""), which operated two manufacturing facilities in Georgia providing affordable housing throughout Alabama, Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas. The ScotBilt acquisition complemented the Company’s prior manufacturing footprint in the attractive mid-south region. In addition to those acquisitions, the Company is also focused on growing its U.S. manufacturing production capacity through various plant start-ups. The Company began production in a previously idled facility in Decatur, Indiana in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. In January 2021, the Company acquired two idle facilities in Pembroke, North Carolina, one of which began production in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. In June 2021, the Company acquired two idle facilities in Navasota, Texas and began production at one of those facilities during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. The Company is also in the process of opening a previously idled facility in Bartow, Florida, which is expected to begin production in fiscal 2024. The Company's acquisitions and investments are part of a strategy to grow and diversify revenue with a focus on increasing the Company’s homebuilding presence in the U.S. as well as improving the results of operations through streamlining production of similar product categories. These acquisitions and investments are included in the Company's consolidated results for periods subsequent to their respective acquisition dates. Industry and Company Outlook Since July 2020, the U.S. and Canadian housing industry demand has generally been robust. The limited availability of existing homes for sale and the broader need for newly built affordable, single-family housing has driven demand for new homes in those markets. In recent years, manufactured home construction experienced revenue growth due to a number of favorable demographic trends and demand drivers in the U.S., including underlying growth trends in key homebuyer groups, such as the population over 55 years of age, the population of first-time homebuyers, and the population of households earning less than $60,000 per year. More recently, we have seen a number of market trends pointing to increased sales of accessory dwelling units (""ADUs"") and urban-to-rural migration as customers accommodate working-from-home patterns, as well as people seeking rent-to-own single-family options. The rise in interest rates in response to inflation have impacted the demand for the Company's products in both the U.S. and Canada. In addition, many of our community customers have reduced order rates in response to excess inventory in their sales channels. As a result, the Company's backlog was $260.0 million as of July 1, 2023 compared to $1.4 billion as of July 2, 2022. Cancellation of end-consumer orders, at the retail level, have been minimal. 14 For the three months ended July 1, 2023, approximately 86% of the Company’s U.S. manufacturing sales were generated from the manufacture of homes that comply with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (""HUD"") code construction standard in the U.S. Industry shipments of HUD-code homes are reported on a one-month lag. According to data reported by the Manufactured Housing Institute, HUD-code industry home shipments were 22,217 and 31,893 units during the three months ended May 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Based on industry data, the Company’s U.S. wholesale market share of HUD code homes sold was 17.9% and 18.0%, for the three months ended May 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Annual HUD-code industry shipments have generally increased since calendar year 2009 when only 50,000 HUD-coded manufactured homes were shipped, the lowest level since the industry began recording statistics in 1959. While shipments of HUD-coded manufactured homes have improved modestly in recent years, manufactured housing’s most recent annual shipment levels still operate at lower levels than the long-term historical average of over 200,000 units annually. Manufactured home sales represent approximately 11% of all of U.S. single family home starts. Our market share in the U.S. total housing market was approximately 2.2% for the twelve months ended July 1, 2023. UNAUDITED INCOME STATEMENTS FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2024 VS. 2023 Three months ended (Dollars in thousands) July 1, 2023 July 2, 2022 Results of Operations Data: Net sales $ 464,769 $ 725,881 Cost of sales 335,096 496,546 Gross profit 129,673 229,335 Selling, general, and administrative expenses 70,439 72,282 Operating income 59,234 157,053 Interest (income) expense, net (9,301 ) 90 Other (income) — (634 ) Income before income taxes 68,535 157,597 Income tax expense 17,266 40,446 Net income $ 51,269 $ 117,151 Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA: Net income $ 51,269 $ 117,151 Income tax expense 17,266 40,446 Interest (income) expense, net (9,301 ) 90 Depreciation and amortization 7,592 5,616 Transaction costs — 338 Other — (973 ) Adjusted EBITDA $ 66,826 $ 162,668 As a percent of net sales: Gross profit 27.9 % 31.6 % Selling, general, and administrative expenses 15.2 % 10.0 % Operating income 12.7 % 21.6 % Net income 11.0 % 16.1 % Adjusted EBITDA 14.4 % 22.4 % 15 NET SALES The following table summarizes net sales for the three months ended July 1, 2023 and July 2, 2022: Three months ended (Dollars in thousands) July 1, 2023 July 2, 2022 $ Change % Change Net sales $ 464,769 $ 725,881 $ (261,112 ) (36.0 %) U.S. manufacturing and retail net sales $ 428,785 $ 661,081 $ (232,296 ) (35.1 %) U.S. homes sold 4,817 6,813 (1,996 ) (29.3 %) U.S. manufacturing and retail average home selling price $ 89.0 $ 97.0 $ (8.0 ) (8.2 %) Canadian manufacturing net sales $ 26,120 $ 45,062 $ (18,942 ) (42.0 %) Canadian homes sold 221 352 (131 ) (37.2 %) Canadian manufacturing average home selling price $ 118.2 $ 128.0 $ (9.8 ) (7.7 %) Corporate/Other net sales $ 9,864 $ 19,738 $ (9,874 ) (50.0 %) U.S. manufacturing facilities in operation at end of period 39 37 U.S. retail sales centers in operation at end of period 31 19 Canadian manufacturing facilities in operation at end of period 5 5 Net sales for the three months ended July 1, 2023 were $464.8 million, a decrease of $261.1 million, or 36.0%, compared to the three months ended July 2, 2022. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. U.S. Factory-built Housing: Net sales for the Company’s U.S. manufacturing and retail operations decreased by $232.3 million, or 35.1%, for the three months ended July 1, 2023 compared to the three months ended July 2, 2022. The decrease was primarily due to a 29.3% decrease in the number of homes sold during the period, as well as an 8.2% decrease in the average home selling price. The decrease in the number of homes sold was due to lower customer orders and lower production volume compared to the prior-year. The average selling price decrease was due, in part, to the impact of disaster relief housing sales of $82.5 million to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (""FEMA"") in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, as well as customers electing fewer and lower cost options on new homes and price decreases of certain products to respond to market dynamics. FEMA units generally have more specifications than our typical products and therefore drive a higher average selling price per home. The decline in sales was partially offset by the fiscal 2023 acquisitions and plant start-up activities. Canadian Factory-built Housing: The Canadian Factory-built Housing segment net sales decreased by $18.9 million, or 42.0% for the three months ended July 1, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year, primarily due to a 37.2% decrease in homes sold and a 7.7% decrease in average home selling price. The decrease in homes sold is due to slowing demand. We also reduced prices on certain models in order to respond to changes in demand. On a constant currency basis, net sales for the Canadian segment were unfavorably impacted by approximately $1.7 million due to fluctuations in the translation of the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar during the three months ended July 1, 2023 as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. Corporate/Other: Net sales for Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation business and the elimination of intersegment sales. For the three months ended July 1, 2023, net sales decreased $9.9 million, or 50.0%, primarily attributable to the decrease in recreational vehicle shipments. GROSS PROFIT The following table summarizes gross profit for the three months ended July 1, 2023 and July 2, 2022: Three months ended (Dollars in thousands) July 1, 2023 July 2, 2022 $ Change % Change Gross profit: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 118,424 $ 209,637 $ (91,213 ) (43.5 %) Canadian Factory-built Housing 7,028 14,795 (7,767 ) (52.5 %) Corporate/Other 4,221 4,903 (682 ) (13.9 %) Total gross profit $ 129,673 $ 229,335 $ (99,662 ) (43.5 %) Gross profit as a percent of net sales 27.9 % 31.6 % 16 Gross profit as a percent of sales during the three months ended July 1, 2023 was 27.9% compared to 31.6% during the three months ended July 2, 2022. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. U.S. Factory-built Housing: Gross profit for the U.S. Factory-built Housing segment decreased by $91.2 million, or 43.5%, during the three months ended July 1, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. Gross profit was 27.6% as a percent of segment net sales for the three months ended July 1, 2023 compared to 31.7% in the same period of the prior fiscal year. The decrease in gross profit as a percent of segment net sales is being driven by lower unit volume and changes in product mix including the decrease in FEMA sales which are generally at higher prices than our core products. Canadian Factory-built Housing: Gross profit for the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment decreased by $7.8 million, or 52.5% during the three months ended July 1, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. The decrease in gross profit is primarily due to lower sales volumes and production. Gross profit as a percent of net sales was 26.9% for the three months ended July 1, 2023, compared to 32.8% in the same period of the prior year, primarily the result of decreased prices for our products in response to market demand and decreased leverage of fixed manufacturing costs. Corporate/Other: Gross profit for the Corporate/Other segment decreased $0.7 million, or 13.9%, during the three months ended July 1, 2023 compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. Gross profit increased as a percent of segment net sales to 42.8% from 24.8% due to revenue mix in the Company's transportation business. SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Selling, general, and administrative expenses include foreign currency transaction gains and losses, equity compensation, and intangible amortization expense. The following table summarizes selling, general, and administrative expenses for the three months ended July 1, 2023 and July 2, 2022: Three months ended (Dollars in thousands) July 1, 2023 July 2, 2022 $ Change % Change Selling, general, and administrative expenses: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 51,279 $ 53,054 $ (1,775 ) (3.3 %) Canadian Factory-built Housing 2,620 3,749 (1,129 ) (30.1 %) Corporate/Other 16,540 15,479 1,061 6.9 % Total selling, general, and administrative expenses $ 70,439 $ 72,282 $ (1,843 ) (2.5 %) Selling, general, and administrative expense as a percent of net sales 15.2 % 10.0 % Selling, general, and administrative expenses were $70.4 million for the three months ended July 1, 2023, a decrease of $1.8 million, or 2.5%, compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. U.S. Factory-built Housing: Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the U.S. Factory-built Housing segment decreased $1.8 million, or 3.3%, during the three months ended July 1, 2023 as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. Selling, general, and administrative expenses, as a percent of segment net sales increased to 12.0% for the three months ended July 1, 2023 compared to 8.0% during the comparable period of the prior fiscal year primarily due to lower sales volume in relation to certain fixed costs and the investment in new capacity. The decrease in selling, general, and administrative expenses resulted from lower sales commissions and incentive compensation which is generally based on sales volume or a measure of profitability, partially offset by expenses for business acquired in fiscal 2023 and investments in new capacity. Canadian Factory-built Housing: Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment decreased $1.1 million, or 30.1%, for the three months ended July 1, 2023 when compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a 17 percent of segment net sales increased to 10.0% for the three months ended July 1, 2023 compared to 8.3% during the comparable period of the prior fiscal year due to less absorption of fixed costs caused by lower sales. The decrease in selling, general, and administrative expenses is due primarily to incentive compensation which is based on sales volume and profitability. Corporate/Other: Selling, general, and administrative expenses for Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation operations, corporate costs incurred for all segments, and intersegment eliminations. Selling, general, and administrative expenses for Corporate/Other increased $1.1 million, or 6.9%, during the three months ended July 1, 2023 as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year due primarily to higher equity-based compensation. INTEREST (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET The following table summarizes the components of interest (income) expense, net for the three months ended July 1, 2023 and July 2, 2022: Three months ended (Dollars in thousands) July 1, 2023 July 2, 2022 $ Change % Change Interest expense $ 377 $ 903 $ (526 ) (58.3 %) Less: interest income (9,678 ) (813 ) (8,865 ) * Interest (income) expense, net $ (9,301 ) $ 90 $ (9,391 ) * Average outstanding floor plan payable $ — $ 38,696 Average outstanding long-term debt $ 12,430 $ 12,430 * indicates that the calculated percentage is not meaningful Interest income, net was $9.3 million for the three months ended July 1, 2023, compared to $0.1 million of expense in the same period of the prior fiscal year. The change was primarily due to higher interest income from higher average invested cash balances, higher interest rates earned on those cash balances, and the repayment of floor plan payables in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. OTHER INCOME The following table summarizes other income for the three months ended July 1, 2023 and July 2, 2022: Three months ended (Dollars in thousands) July 1, 2023 July 2, 2022 $ Change % Change Other income $ — $ (634 ) $ 634 (100.0 %) During the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company received insurance proceeds for partial settlement of certain Champion Home Builders’ pre-bankruptcy workers' compensation claims, which was partially offset by transaction costs incurred for the acquisition of Manis. INCOME TAX EXPENSE The following table summarizes income tax expense for the three months ended July 1, 2023 and July 2, 2022: Three months ended (Dollars in thousands) July 1, 2023 July 2, 2022 $ Change % Change Income tax expense $ 17,266 $ 40,446 $ (23,180 ) (57.3 %) Effective tax rate 25.2 % 25.7 % Income tax expense for the three months ended July 1, 2023 was $17.3 million, representing an effective tax rate of 25.2%, compared to income tax expense of $40.4 million, representing an effective tax rate of 25.7% for the three months ended July 2, 2022. The Company’s effective tax rate for the three months ended July 1, 2023 differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of 21.0% due primarily to the effect of state and local income taxes, non-deductible expenses, tax credits, and results in foreign jurisdictions. The Company’s effective tax rate for the three months ended July 2, 2022 differed from the federal statutory income tax rate of 21.0% due primarily to the effect of state and local income taxes, non-deductible expenses, tax credits, and results in foreign jurisdictions. 18 ADJUSTED EBITDA The following table reconciles net income, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, to Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the three months ended July 1, 2023 and July 2, 2022: Three months ended (Dollars in thousands) July 1, 2023 July 2, 2022 $ Change % Change Net income $ 51,269 $ 117,151 $ (65,882 ) (56.2 %) Income tax expense 17,266 40,446 (23,180 ) (57.3 %) Interest (income) expense, net (9,301 ) 90 (9,391 ) * Depreciation and amortization 7,592 5,616 1,976 35.2 % Transaction costs — 338 (338 ) * Other — (973 ) 973 * Adjusted EBITDA $ 66,826 $ 162,668 $ (95,842 ) (58.9 %) * indicates that the calculated percentage is not meaningful Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended July 1, 2023 was $66.8 million, a decrease of $95.8 million from the same period of the prior fiscal year. The decrease is primarily a result of lower operating income due to decreases in sales volume, average selling prices and gross margins, partially offset by lower SG&A expenses. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss plus expense or minus income: (a) the provision for income taxes; (b) interest (income) expense, net; (c) depreciation and amortization; (d) gain or loss from discontinued operations; (e) non-cash restructuring charges and impairment of assets; and (f) other non-operating income and costs, including but not limited to those costs for the acquisition and integration or disposition of businesses and idle facilities. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of earnings calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income or loss, net sales, operating income or earnings per share prepared on a U.S. GAAP basis. Adjusted EBITDA does not purport to represent cash flow provided by, or used in, operating activities as defined by U.S. GAAP, which is presented in the Statement of Cash Flows. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is presented as a supplemental measure of the Company’s financial performance that management believes is useful to investors, because the excluded items may vary significantly in timing or amounts and/or may obscure trends useful in evaluating and comparing the Company’s operating activities across reporting periods. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA is useful to an investor in evaluating operating performance for the following reasons: (i) Adjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors to measure a company’s operating performance without regard to items such as interest income and expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization and equity-based compensation, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and the book value of assets, capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired; and (ii) analysts and investors use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to evaluate the overall operating performance of companies in the industry. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA for planning purposes, including the preparation of internal annual operating budget and periodic forecasts: (i) in communications with the Board of Directors and investors concerning financial performance; (ii) as a factor in determining bonuses under certain incentive compensation programs; and (iii) as a measure of operating performance used to determine the ability to provide cash flows to support investments in capital assets, acquisitions and working capital requirements for operating expansion. BACKLOG Although orders from customers can be canceled at any time without penalty, and unfilled orders are not necessarily an indication of future business, the Company’s unfilled U.S. and Canadian manufacturing orders at July 1, 2023 totaled $260.0 million compared to $1.4 billion at July 2, 2022. The decrease in backlog is due to the reduction in demand and increased capacity to manufacture homes. In addition, many of our community customers have reduced order rates in response to excess inventory in their sales channels. Cancellation of end-customer orders, at the retail level, has been minimal. 19 Liquidity and Capital Resources Sources and Uses of Cash The following table presents summary cash flow information for the three months ended July 1, 2023 and July 2, 2022: Three months ended (Dollars in thousands) July 1, 2023 July 2, 2022 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 74,857 $ 47,422 Investing activities (25,615 ) (18,971 ) Financing activities (961 ) 2,056 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents 1,983 (2,142 ) Net increase in cash and cash equivalents 50,264 28,365 Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period 747,453 435,413 Cash and cash equivalents at end of period $ 797,717 $ 463,778 The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and existing cash balances. Cash balances and cash flows from operations for the next year are expected to be adequate to cover working capital requirements, capital expenditures, and strategic initiatives and investments. The Company has an Amended Credit Agreement which provides for a $200.0 million revolving credit facility, including a $45.0 million letter of credit sub-facility. At July 1, 2023, $166.0 million was available for borrowing under the Amended Credit Agreement. The Company’s revolving credit facility includes (i) a maximum consolidated total net leverage ratio of 3.25 to 1.00, subject to an upward adjustment upon the consummation of a material acquisition, and (ii) a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.00 to 1.00. The Company anticipates compliance with its debt covenants and projects its level of cash availability to be in excess of cash needed to operate the business for the next year and beyond. In the event operating cash flow and existing cash balances were deemed inadequate to support the Company’s liquidity needs, and one or more capital resources were to become unavailable, the Company would revise its operating strategies. Cash provided by operating activities was $74.9 million for the three months ended July 1, 2023 compared to $47.4 million for the three months ended July 2, 2022. Although net income during the first quarter of fiscal 2023 was higher, cash provided by operating activities was lower than the current year due to the significant investment in working capital items to facilitate the sales to FEMA. Cash used in investing activities was $25.6 million for the three months ended July 1, 2023 compared to $19.0 million for the three months ended July 2, 2022. The increase in cash used for investing activities was related to the Company's investment in floor plan loans in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, net of payments received. Cash used in financing activities was $1.0 million for the three months ended July 1, 2023 compared to cash provided by financing activities of $2.1 million for the three months ended July 2, 2022. The increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to tax payments on equity-based compensation.

See accompanying Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 5 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consoli dated Financial Statements 1. Basis of Presentation and Business Nature of Operations: Skyline Champion Corporation's (the “Company”) operations consist of manufacturing, retail and transportation activities. At December 31, 2022, the Company operated 37 manufacturing facilities throughout the United States (“U.S.”) and five manufacturing facilities in western Canada that primarily construct factory-built, timber-framed manufactured and modular houses that are sold primarily to independent retailers, builders/developers, and manufactured home community operators. In addition to its core home building business, the Company provides construction services to install and set-up factory-built homes. The Company’s retail operations consist of 31 sales centers that sell manufactured houses to consumers across the U.S. The Company’s transportation business engages independent owners/drivers to transport recreational vehicles throughout the U.S. and Canada and manufactured houses in certain regions of the U.S. The Company also has a holding company located in the Netherlands. Basis of Presentation: The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) for Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Article 10 of SEC Regulation S-X. Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“U.S. GAAP”) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany balances and transactions. In the opinion of management, these statements include all normal recurring adjustments necessary to fairly state the Company’s consolidated results of operations, cash flows, and financial position. The Company has evaluated subsequent events after the balance sheet date through the date of the filing of this report with the SEC. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the SEC on May 24, 2022 (the “Fiscal 2022 Annual Report”). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The condensed consolidated income statements, condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income, and condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations or cash flows for the full year. The Company’s fiscal year is a 52- or 53-week period that ends on the Saturday nearest to March 31. The Company’s current fiscal year, “fiscal 2023,” will end on April 1, 2023 and will include 52 weeks. References to “fiscal 2022” refer to the Company’s fiscal year ended April 2, 2022. The three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022 included 13 and 39 weeks, respectively. The Company’s allowance for credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost reflects management’s estimate of credit losses over the remaining expected life of such assets, measured primarily using historical experience, as well as current economic conditions and forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. Expected credit losses for newly recognized financial assets, as well as changes to expected credit losses during the period, are recognized in earnings. Accounts receivable are reflected net of reserves of $ 2.1 million and $ 1.7 million at December 31, 2022 and April 2, 2022, respectively. At both December 31, 2022 and April 2, 2022, other notes receivable are reflected net of reserves of $ 0.4 million . In May 2022, the Company acquired certain operating assets from Manis Custom Builders, Inc. (""Manis""). In July 2022, the Company acquired 12 Factory Expo retail sales centers from Alta Cima Corporation. The purchase price and net assets acquired for both transactions were not material to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. There were no accounting standards recently issued that are expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations. 2. Inventories, net The components of inventory, net of reserves for obsolete inventory, were as follows: (Dollars in thousands) December 31, 2022 April 2, 2022 Raw materials $ 113,518 $ 141,238 Work in process 26,420 26,523 Finished goods and other 81,003 73,573 Total inventories, net $ 220,941 $ 241,334 6 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued At December 31, 2022 and April 2, 2022, reserves for obsolete inventory were $ 7.0 million and $ 4.8 million , respectively. 3. Property, Plant, and Equipment Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated primarily on a straight-line basis, generally over the following estimated useful lives: land improvements – 3 to 10 years; buildings and improvements – 8 to 25 years ; and vehicles and machinery and equipment – 3 to 8 years . Depreciation expense for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022 was $ 3.8 million and $ 3.3 million , respectively. Depreciation expense for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022 was $ 11.7 million and $ 9.9 million , respectively. The components of property, plant, and equipment were as follows: (Dollars in thousands) December 31, 2022 April 2, 2022 Land and improvements $ 41,526 $ 39,815 Buildings and improvements 115,464 104,085 Machinery and equipment 81,147 69,518 Construction in progress 28,704 10,280 Property, plant, and equipment, at cost 266,841 223,698 Less: accumulated depreciation ( 100,984 ) ( 90,713 ) Property, plant, and equipment, net $ 165,857 $ 132,985 4. Goodwill, Intangible Assets, and Cloud Computing Arrangements Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination.

Debt and Floor Plan Payable Long-term debt consisted of the following: (Dollars in thousands) December 31, 2022 April 2, 2022 Obligations under industrial revenue bonds due 2029 $ 12,430 $ 12,430 Revolving credit facility maturing in 2026 — — Total long-term debt $ 12,430 $ 12,430 On July 7, 2021, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with a syndicate of banks that provides for a revolving credit facility of up to $ 200.0 million, including a $ 45.0 million letter of credit sub-facility (""Amended Credit Agreement""). The Amended Credit Agreement replaced the Company's previously existing $ 100.0 million revolving credit facility. Outstanding borrowings of $ 26.9 million on the Company's previous revolving credit facility were repaid in July 2021. The Amended Credit Agreement allows the Company to draw down, repay and re-draw loans on the available facility during the term, subject to certain terms and conditions, matures in July 2026 , and has no scheduled amortization. The Company capitalized $ 1.1 million of deferred financing fees associated with the Amended Credit Agreement, which are included in other noncurrent assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The Company wrote off $ 0.3 million of deferred financing fees associated with the previously existing credit facility during the second quarter of fiscal 2022. 8 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued The interest rate on borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement adjusts based on the consolidated total net leverage of the Company from a high of the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate ("" LIBOR"") or the Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus the benchmark replacement adjustment (""Replacement Rate"") plus 1.875 % and Alternative Base Rate ("" ABR"") plus 0.875 %, at the election of the Company, when the consolidated total net leverage ratio is equal to or greater than 2.25 :1.00, to a low of LIBOR or the Replacement Rate plus 1.125 % and ABR plus 0.125 % when the consolidated total net leverage is below 0.50:1.00. In addition, the Company is obligated to pay an unused line fee ranging between 0.15 % and 0.3 % (depending on the consolidated total net leverage ratio) in respect of unused commitments under the Amended Credit Agreement. There were no outstanding borrowings under the revo lving credit facility at December 31, 2022 and April, 2, 2022, respectively. At December 31, 2022 the interest rate under the Amended Credit Agreement was 5.60% and letters of credit issued under the Amended Credit Agreement totaled $ 32.1 million. Available borrowing capacity under the Amended Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2022 was $ 167.9 million. Obligations under industrial revenue bonds are supported by letters of credit and bear interest based on a municipal bond index rate. The weighted-average interest rate at December 31, 2022, including related costs and fees, was 5.25 %. T he industrial revenue bonds require lump-sum payments of principal upon maturity in 2029 . The Amended Credit Agreement contains covenants that restrict the amount of additional debt, liens and certain payments, including equity buybacks, investments, dispositions, mergers and consolidations, among other restrictions as defined. The Company was in compliance with all covenants of the Amended Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2022. Floor Plan Payable The Company’s retail operations historically utilized floor plan financing to fund the purchase of manufactured homes for display or resale. During the third quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company repaid all of its outstanding floor plan borrowings. At April 2, 2022, the Company had outstanding borrowings on floor plan financing of $ 35.5 million. Total credit line capacity provided under the agreements wa s $ 70.0 million as of December 31, 2022 . Under floor plan financing, borrowings are secured by the financed homes and are required to be repaid when the Company sells the home to a customer. 9 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued 8.

Income Taxes For the three months ended December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022, the Company recorded $ 24.9 million and $ 23.3 million of income tax expense and had an effective tax rate of 23.1 % and 25.6 % , respectively. For the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022, the Company recorded $ 113.4 million and $ 53.7 million of income tax expense and had an effective tax rate of 24.8 % and 25.0 % , respectively. The Company’s effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of 21.0 % due primarily to the effect of state and local income taxes, non-deductible expenses, tax credits, and results in foreign jurisdictions. The Company’s effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended January 1, 2022 differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of 21.0 % due primarily to the effect of state and local income taxes, non-deductible expenses, tax credits, results in foreign jurisdictions, and tax benefits from vested equity compensation. At December 31, 2022 , the Company had no unrecognized tax benefits. The Company does not anticipate any material changes to uncertain tax benefits in the next 12 months. The Company records interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. 10 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued 10. Earnings Per Share Basic net income per share attributable to the Company was computed by dividing net income attributable to the Company by the average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated using our weighted-average outstanding common shares, including the dilutive effect of stock awards as determined under the treasury stock method. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share: Three months ended Nine months ended (Dollars and shares in thousands, except per share data) December 31, 2022 January 1, 2022 December 31, 2022 January 1, 2022 Numerator: Net income attributable to the Company's common shareholders $ 82,813 $ 67,622 $ 344,056 $ 161,246 Denominator: Basic weighted-average shares outstanding 56,971 56,847 56,946 56,787 Dilutive securities 406 491 444 498 Diluted weighted-average shares outstanding 57,377 57,338 57,390 57,285 Basic net income per share $ 1.45 $ 1.19 $ 6.04 $ 2.84 Diluted net income per share $ 1.44 $ 1.18 $ 6.00 $ 2.81 11. Segment Information Financial results for the Company's reportable segments have been prepared using a management approach, which is consistent with the basis and manner in which financial information is evaluated by the Company's chief operating decision maker in allocating resources and in assessing performance. The Company’s chief operating decision maker, the Chief Executive Officer, evaluates the performance of the Company’s segments primarily based on net sales, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (“EBITDA”) and operating assets. The Company operates in two reportable segments: (i) U.S. Factory-built Housing, which includes manufacturing and retail housing operations and (ii) Canadian Factory-built Housing. Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation operations, corporate costs incurred for all segments and intersegment eliminations. Segments are generally determined by geography. Segment data includes intersegment revenues and corporate office costs that are directly and exclusively incurred for each segment. Total assets for Corporate/Other primarily includes cash and U.S. deferred tax items not specifically allocated to another segment. 11 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued Selected financial information by reportable segment was as follows: Three months ended Nine months ended (Dollars in thousands) December 31, 2022 January 1, 2022 December 31, 2022 January 1, 2022 Net sales: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 541,838 $ 484,319 $ 1,957,156 $ 1,413,338 Canadian Factory-built Housing 31,342 36,910 115,602 113,242 Corporate/Other 9,142 13,461 42,270 42,532 Consolidated net sales $ 582,322 $ 534,690 $ 2,115,028 $ 1,569,112 Operating income: U.S. Factory-built Housing EBITDA $ 115,483 $ 98,724 $ 476,332 $ 239,816 Canadian Factory-built Housing EBITDA 5,893 7,571 27,361 19,627 Corporate/Other EBITDA ( 12,323 ) ( 9,638 ) ( 34,205 ) ( 26,966 ) Other expense (income) — 7 ( 634 ) ( 36 ) Depreciation ( 3,824 ) ( 3,348 ) ( 11,660 ) ( 9,869 ) Amortization ( 2,960 ) ( 1,902 ) ( 7,681 ) ( 5,664 ) Consolidated operating income $ 102,269 $ 91,414 $ 449,513 $ 216,908 Depreciation: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 3,245 $ 2,706 $ 9,787 $ 7,935 Canadian Factory-built Housing 277 279 903 837 Corporate/Other 302 363 970 1,097 Consolidated depreciation $ 3,824 $ 3,348 $ 11,660 $ 9,869 Amortization of U.S. Factory-built Housing intangible assets: $ 2,960 $ 1,902 $ 7,681 $ 5,664 Capital expenditures: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 11,181 $ 6,799 $ 34,892 $ 19,070 Canadian Factory-built Housing 1,163 248 2,592 589 Corporate/Other 220 632 693 3,125 Consolidated capital expenditures $ 12,564 $ 7,679 $ 38,177 $ 22,784 (Dollars in thousands) December 31, 2022 April 2, 2022 Total Assets: U.S. Factory-built Housing (1) $ 702,432 $ 695,500 Canadian Factory-built Housing (1) 121,366 107,459 Corporate/Other (1) 687,889 431,660 Consolidated total assets $ 1,511,687 $ 1,234,619 12. Commitments, Contingencies and Legal Proceedings Repurchase Contingencies and Guarantees The Company is contingently liable under terms of repurchase agreements with lending institutions that provide wholesale floor plan financing to retailers. These arrangements, which are customary in the manufactured housing industry, provide for the repurchase of products sold to retailers in the event of default by the retailer on its agreement to pay the financial institution. The risk of loss from these agreements is significantly reduced by the potential resale value of any products that are subject to repurchase and is spread over numerous retailers. The repurchase price is generally determined by the original sales price of the product less contractually defined curtailment payments. Based on these repurchase agreements and our historical loss experience, we established an associated loss reserve which was $ 2.6 million and $ 2.3 million at December 31, 2022 and April 2, 2022, respectively. Excluding the resale value of the homes, the contingent repurchase obligation as of December 31, 2022 was estimated to be $ 399.4 million . Losses incurred on homes repurchased were not significant during the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 or January 1, 2022. 12 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued At December 31, 2022 , the Company was contingently obligated for $ 32.1 million under letters of credit, primarily consisting of $ 12.6 million to support long-term debt, $ 19.2 million to support the casualty insurance program, and $ 0.3 million to support bonding agreements. The letters of credit are issued from a sub-facility of the Amended Credit Agreement. The Company was also contingently obligated for $ 30.8 million under surety bonds, generally to support performance on long-term construction contracts and license and service bonding requirements. The Company has received claims for damage related to water intrusion in homes built in one of its manufacturing facilities. The Company is investigating the cause of the damage and assessing its responsibility to remediate. While it is reasonably possible that the Company will receive future claims that could result in additional costs to repair that could be significant in the aggregate, the Company is unable to estimate the number of such claims or the amount or range of any potential losses associated with such claims at this time. In the normal course of business, the Company’s former subsidiaries that operated in the United Kingdom historically provided certain guarantees to two customers. Those guarantees provide contractual liability for proven construction defects up to 12 years from the date of delivery of certain products. The guarantees remain a contingent liability of the Company which declines over time through October 2027. As of the date of this report, the Company expects few, if any, claims to be reported under the terms of the guarantees. Legal Proceedings The Company has agreed to indemnify counterparties in the ordinary course of its business in agreements to acquire and sell business assets and in financing arrangements. The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of its business. As of the date of this filing, the Company believes the ultimate liability with respect to these contingent obligations will not have, either individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 13 Item 2. MANAGEMENT’ S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following should be read in conjunction with Skyline Champion Corporation’s condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear in Item 1 of this Report. Overview Skyline Champion Corporation (the “Company”) is a leading producer of factory-built housing in the U.S. and Canada. The Company serves as a complete solutions provider across complementary and vertically integrated businesses including company-owned retail locations, transportation logistics services, and construction services to install and set-up factory-built homes. The Company markets its homes under several nationally recognized brand names including Skyline Homes, Champion Home Builders, Genesis Homes, Athens Park Models, Dutch Housing, Atlantic Homes, Excel Homes, Homes of Merit, New Era, Redman Homes, ScotBilt Homes, Shore Park, Silvercrest, and Titan Homes in the U.S., and Moduline and SRI Homes in western Canada. The Company operates 37 manufacturing facilities throughout the U.S. and five manufacturing facilities in western Canada that primarily construct factory-built, timber-framed, manufactured and modular houses that are sold primarily to independent retailers, builders/developers, and manufactured home community operators. The Company’s retail operations consist of 31 sales centers that sell manufactured homes to consumers across the U.S. The Company’s transportation business engages independent owners/drivers to transport manufactured homes, recreational vehicles, and other products throughout the U.S. and Canada. Acquisitions and Expansions Over the last several years, demand for the Company’s products, primarily affordable housing in the U.S., has continued to improve. As a result, the Company has focused on operational improvements to increase capacity utilization and profitability at its existing manufacturing facilities as well as executing measured expansion of its manufacturing and retail footprint through facility and equipment investments and acquisitions. The Company continues to focus on growing in strong housing markets across the U.S. and Canada, as well as expanding products and services to provide more holistic solutions to homebuyers. In July 2022, the Company acquired 12 Factory Expo retail sales centers from Alta Cima Corporation, which expanded the internal retail network across a broader portion of the U.S. In May 2022, the Company acquired Manis Custom Builders, Inc. (""Manis"") in order to expand its manufacturing footprint and further streamline its product offering in the Southeast U.S. On February 28, 2021, the Company acquired ScotBilt Homes, LLC and related companies (collectively, ""Scotbilt""), which operated two manufacturing facilities in Georgia providing affordable housing throughout Alabama, Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas. The ScotBilt acquisition complemented the Company’s prior manufacturing footprint in the attractive mid-south region. The Company is also focused on streamlining its U.S. manufacturing production capacity through various plant start-ups. In June 2021, the Company acquired two idle facilities in Navasota, Texas in order to increase its production capabilities in the Texas market. The Company began production at one of those facilities during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. In January 2021, the Company acquired two idle facilities in Pembroke, North Carolina, and is currently certifying one of those facilities for production in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. The Company is also in the process of opening previously idled facilities in Bartow, Florida and Decatur, Indiana, both of which are expecting to begin production in fiscal 2024. The Company's acquisitions and investments are part of a strategy to grow and diversify revenue with a focus on increasing the Company’s homebuilding presence in the U.S. as well as improving the results of operations through streamlining production of similar product categories. These acquisitions and investments are included in the Company's consolidated results for periods subsequent to their respective acquisition dates. Industry and Company Outlook Since July 2020, the U.S. and Canadian housing industry demand has generally been robust. The limited availability of existing homes for sale and the broader need for newly built affordable, single-family housing has driven demand for new homes in those markets. In recent years, manufactured home construction experienced revenue growth due to a number of favorable demographic trends and demand drivers in the U.S., including underlying growth trends in key homebuyer groups, such as the population over 55 years of age, the population of first-time homebuyers, and the population of households earning less than $60,000 per year. More recently, we have seen a number of market trends pointing to increased sales of accessory dwelling units (""ADUs"") and urban-to-rural migration as customers accommodate working-from-home patterns, as well as people seeking rent-to-own single-family options. Recent increases in interest rates in response to inflation have impacted the demand for the Company's products in both the U.S. and Canada. Incoming orders from our manufacturing customers decreased compared to the same quarter last year. In addition, our independent retail customers have cancelled stock-model orders in response to the increase in floor plan carrying costs and the desire to optimize their model home inventory based on rising interest rates. The Company's backlog was $532.0 million as of December 31, 2022 compared to $1.5 billion as of January 1, 2022. The decrease in backlog is due to the year-over-year decrease in net orders and higher production volumes during fiscal 2023 compared to last year. Cancellation of end-consumer orders, at the retail level, have been minimal. 14 The robust demand for housing in 2021 and the first half of 2022 resulted in significant increases in certain raw material and labor costs. Although we have seen recent improvements in raw material costs and availability, we continue to experience intermittent disruption and higher freight costs. Finding and retaining qualified labor continues to be a challenge for our plants which requires us to monitor our compensation programs and adjust accordingly. We manage our business to anticipate or quickly react to these supply challenges and cost increases and generally are able to pass along increased costs to our customers. For the nine months ended December 31, 2022, approximately 88% of the Company’s U.S. manufacturing sales were generated from the manufacture of homes that comply with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (""HUD"") code construction standard in the U.S. Industry shipments of HUD-code homes are reported on a one-month lag. According to data reported by the Manufactured Housing Institute, HUD-code industry home shipments were 76,802 and 71,281 units during the eight months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Based on industry data, the Company’s U.S. wholesale market share of HUD code homes sold was 20.9% and 19.4%, for the eight months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Annual HUD-code industry shipments have generally increased each year since calendar year 2009 when only 50,000 HUD-coded manufactured homes were shipped, the lowest level since the industry began recording statistics in 1959. While shipments of HUD-coded manufactured homes have improved modestly in recent years, manufactured housing’s most recent annual shipment levels still operate at lower levels than the long-term historical average of over 200,000 units annually.

The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. U.S. Factory-built Housing: Net sales for the Company’s U.S. manufacturing and retail operations increased by $57.5 million, or 11.9%, for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the three months ended January 1, 2022. The increase was primarily due to an increase in average home selling price of 13.5%, partially offset by a decrease in homes sold of 1.4%. The decrease in the number of homes sold was a result of lower customer orders and production volume, partially offset by additional capacity from recent acquisitions and expansions. The average selling price increase was due to pricing actions previously enacted on our products in response to rising material, freight, and labor costs. Generally, we have been able to pass the increase in input costs to our customers. Canadian Factory-built Housing: The Canadian Factory-built Housing segment net sales decreased by $5.6 million, or 15.1% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year, primarily due to a 18.8% decrease in homes sold, partially offset by a 4.5% increase in average home selling price. The increase in average selling price was due to pricing actions previously enacted in response to rising material and labor costs. The decrease in homes sold is due to slowing housing demand in certain regions of Canada and a shift in mix. On a constant currency basis, net sales for the Canadian segment were unfavorably impacted by approximately $2.3 million due to fluctuations in the translation of the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar during the three months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. Corporate/Other: Net sales for Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation business and the elimination of intersegment sales. For the three months ended December 31, 2022, net sales decreased $4.3 million, or 32.1%, primarily attributable to the decrease in home and recreational vehicle shipments. 16 GROSS PROFIT The following table summarizes gross profit for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022: Three months ended (Dollars in thousands) December 31, 2022 January 1, 2022 $ Change % Change Gross profit: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 162,092 $ 143,333 $ 18,759 13.1 % Canadian Factory-built Housing 8,471 10,251 (1,780 ) (17.4 %) Corporate/Other 3,526 3,655 (129 ) (3.5 %) Total gross profit $ 174,089 $ 157,239 $ 16,850 10.7 % Gross profit as a percent of net sales 29.9 % 29.4 % Gross profit as a percent of sales during the three months ended December 31, 2022 was 29.9% compared to 29.4% during the three months ended January 1, 2022.

Selling, general, and administrative expenses for Corporate/Other increased $2.5 million, or 18.2%, during the three months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year due to increases in equity compensation and investments made to enhance our online customer experience and supporting systems. INTEREST (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET The following table summarizes the components of interest (income) expense, net for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022: Three months ended (Dollars in thousands) December 31, 2022 January 1, 2022 $ Change % Change Interest expense $ 998 $ 701 $ 297 42.4 % Less: interest income (6,407 ) (193 ) (6,214 ) 3,219.7 % Interest (income) expense, net $ (5,409 ) $ 508 $ (5,917 ) (1,164.8 %) Average outstanding floor plan payable $ 27,244 $ 32,942 Average outstanding long-term debt $ 12,430 $ 12,430 Interest, net was $5.4 million of income for the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared to $0.5 million of expense in the same period of the prior fiscal year. The change was primarily due to higher interest income during the third quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the prior year. Higher interest rates and higher invested cash balances versus the comparable period were the primary drivers of the increase in interest income. INCOME TAX EXPENSE The following table summarizes income tax expense for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022: Three months ended (Dollars in thousands) December 31, 2022 January 1, 2022 $ Change % Change Income tax expense $ 24,865 $ 23,277 $ 1,588 6.8 % Effective tax rate 23.1 % 25.6 % Income tax expense for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $24.9 million, representing an effective tax rate of 23.1%, compared to income tax expense of $23.3 million, representing an effective tax rate of 25.6%, for the three months ended January 1, 2022. 18 The Company’s effective tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2022 differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of 21.0% due primarily to the effect of state and local income taxes, non-deductible expenses, tax credits, and results in foreign jurisdictions. The Company’s effective tax rate for the three months ended January 1, 2022 differed from the federal statutory income tax rate of 21.0% due primarily to the effect of state and local income taxes, non-deductible expenses, tax credits, results in foreign jurisdictions, and tax benefits from vested equity compensation.

The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. U.S. Factory-built Housing: Net sales for the Company’s U.S. manufacturing and retail operations increased by $543.8 million, or 38.5%, for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the nine months ended January 1, 2022. The increase was primarily due to a 9.6% increase in the number of homes sold during the period, as well as a 26.4% increase in the average home selling price. The increase in the number of homes sold was a result of utilizing additional capacity from recent acquisitions and expansions, FEMA Disaster Relief housing sales and increased production output from our existing facilities. The average selling price increase was due, in part, to the impact of sales to FEMA of $200.3 million as well as to pricing actions on our core products taken in response to rising material, freight, and labor costs. FEMA units generally have more specifications than our typical products and therefore drive a higher average selling price per home. Canadian Factory-built Housing: The Canadian Factory-built Housing segment net sales increased by $2.4 million, or 2.1% for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year, primarily due to a 18.7% increase in average home selling price, partially offset by a 14.0% decrease in homes sold. The increase in average selling price was due to pricing actions previously taken in response to rising material and labor costs and a change in product mix. The decrease in homes sold is due to slowing demand in certain regions of Canada and a shift in mix. On a constant currency basis, net sales for the Canadian segment were unfavorably impacted by approximately $5.1 million due to fluctuations in the translation of the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. Corporate/Other: Net sales for Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation business and the elimination of intersegment sales. For the nine months ended December 31, 2022, net sales decreased $0.3 million, or 0.6%.

The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. U.S. Factory-built Housing: Gross profit for the U.S. Factory-built Housing segment increased by $269.3 million, or 75.0%, during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. Gross profit was 32.1% as a percent of segment net sales for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to 25.4% in the same period of the prior fiscal year. The increase in gross profit was due to a combination of higher volumes and sales prices for our products. In addition, sales to FEMA during the first half of fiscal 2023 increased margins since these sales are generally at higher prices than our core products, which helps offset the disruption to our operations and our customers. Canadian Factory-built Housing: Gross profit for the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment increased by $9.0 million, or 32.8% during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. Gross profit as a percent of net sales was 31.5% for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, compared to 24.2% in the same period of the prior year. The increase in gross profit was due to higher average selling prices of our homes and lower material input costs. Corporate/Other: Gross profit for the Corporate/Other segment increased $1.1 million, or 9.7%, during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. Gross profit increased as a percent of segment net sales to 29.9% from 27.0% due to revenue mix in the Company's transportation business. SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Selling, general, and administrative expenses include foreign currency transaction gains and losses, equity compensation, and intangible amortization expense. The following table summarizes selling, general, and administrative expenses for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022: Nine months ended (Dollars in thousands) December 31, 2022 January 1, 2022 $ Change % Change Selling, general, and administrative expenses: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 169,608 $ 132,977 $ 36,631 27.5 % Canadian Factory-built Housing 9,979 8,654 1,325 15.3 % Corporate/Other 48,430 39,557 8,873 22.4 % Total selling, general, and administrative expenses $ 228,017 $ 181,188 $ 46,829 25.8 % Selling, general, and administrative expense as a percent of net sales 10.8 % 11.5 % Selling, general, and administrative expenses were $228.0 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, an increase of $46.8 million, or 25.8%, compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year.

U.S. Factory-built Housing: Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the U.S. Factory-built Housing segment increased $36.6 million, or 27.5%, during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. Selling, general, and administrative expenses, as a percent of segment net sales decreased to 8.7% for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to 9.4% during the comparable period of the prior fiscal year primarily due to higher revenue and increased leverage of fixed costs. The increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses resulted from higher sales commissions and incentive compensation which is generally based on sales volume or a measure of profitability, and higher wage and related expenses from headcount increases in response to increased production levels, and from added selling and administrative costs for our business expansions. 21 Canadian Factory-built Housing: Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment increased $1.3 million, or 15.3%, for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 when compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percent of segment net sales increased to 8.6% for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to 7.6% during the comparable period of the prior fiscal year. The increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses is due to higher incentive compensation related to the increase in segment profitability. Corporate/Other: Selling, general, and administrative expenses for Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation operations, corporate costs incurred for all segments, and intersegment eliminations. Selling, general, and administrative expenses for Corporate/Other increased $8.9 million, or 22.4%, during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year due to increases in equity compensation and investments made to enhance our online customer experience and supporting systems.

The change was primarily due to higher interest income from higher average invested cash balances and higher interest rates during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. OTHER INCOME The following table summarizes other income for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022: Nine months ended (Dollars in thousands) December 31, 2022 January 1, 2022 $ Change % Change Other income $ (634 ) $ (36 ) $ (598 ) 1,661.1 % Other income increased $0.6 million during the nine months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year.

ADJUSTED EBITDA The following table reconciles net income, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, to Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022: Nine months ended (Dollars in thousands) December 31, 2022 January 1, 2022 $ Change % Change Net income $ 344,056 $ 161,246 $ 182,810 113.4 % Income tax expense 113,384 53,696 59,688 111.2 % Interest (income) expense, net (7,293 ) 2,002 (9,295 ) * Depreciation and amortization 19,341 15,533 3,808 24.5 % Transaction costs 338 — 338 * Other (973 ) — (973 ) * Adjusted EBITDA $ 468,853 $ 232,477 $ 236,376 101.7 % * indicates that the calculated percentage is not meaningful Adjusted EBITDA for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 was $468.9 million, an increase of $236.4 million from the same period of the prior fiscal year. The increase is primarily a result of higher operating income due to increases in sales volume, average selling prices and gross margins, partially offset by higher SG&A expenses. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss plus, (a) the provision for income taxes, (b) interest income or expense, net, (c) depreciation and amortization, (d) gain or loss from discontinued operations, (e) restructuring charges and impairment of assets, and (f) other non-operating income and costs, including those for the acquisition and integration or disposition of businesses. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of earnings calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income or loss, net sales, operating income or earnings per share prepared on a U.S. GAAP basis. Adjusted EBITDA does not purport to represent cash flow provided by, or used in, operating activities as defined by U.S. GAAP, which is presented in the Statement of Cash Flows. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, investors should be aware that, in the future, the Company may incur expenses similar to those adjusted for in this presentation. This presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an implication that the Company’s future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items. Adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are: Adjusted EBITDA: Given these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our U.S. GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures only on a supplemental basis. 23 BACKLOG Although orders from customers can be cancelled at any time without penalty, and unfilled orders are not necessarily an indication of future business, the Company’s unfilled U.S. and Canadian manufacturing orders at December 31, 2022 totaled $532.0 million compared to $1.5 billion at January 1, 2022. The decrease in backlog was primarily driven by higher production rates and lower net orders. Recent increases in interest rates in response to inflation has impacted the demand for the Company's products in both the U.S. and Canada. Incoming gross orders from our customers decreased compared to the same quarter last year. In addition, our independent retail customers have cancelled stock-model orders in response to the increase in floor plan carrying costs and the desire to optimize their model home inventory. Cancellation of end-consumer orders, at the retail level, has been minimal. Liquidity and Capital Resources Sources and Uses of Cash The following table presents summary cash flow information for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022: Nine months ended (Dollars in thousands) December 31, 2022 January 1, 2022 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 364,044 $ 164,406 Investing activities (44,763 ) (22,921 ) Financing activities (36,227 ) (21,355 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents (6,019 ) (578 ) Net increase in cash and cash equivalents 277,035 119,552 Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period 435,413 262,581 Cash and cash equivalents at end of period $ 712,448 $ 382,133 The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and existing cash balances. Cash balances and cash flows from operations for the next year are expected to be adequate to cover working capital requirements, capital expenditures, and strategic initiatives and investments. The Company has an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement which provides for a $200.0 million revolving credit facility, including a $45.0 million letter of credit sub-facility (""Amended Credit Agreement""). At December 31, 2022, $167.9 million was available for borrowing under the Amended Credit Agreement. The Company’s revolving credit facility includes (i) a maximum consolidated total net leverage ratio of 3.25 to 1.00, subject to an upward adjustment upon the consummation of a material acquisition, and (ii) a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.00 to 1.00. The Company anticipates compliance with its debt covenants and projects its level of cash availability to be in excess of cash needed to operate the business for the next year and beyond. In the event operating cash flow and existing cash balances were deemed inadequate to support the Company’s liquidity needs, and one or more capital resources were to become unavailable, the Company would revise its operating strategies. Cash provided by operating activities was $364.0 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to $164.4 million for the nine months ended January 1, 2022. Cash provided by operating activities increased due to higher net income and higher cash generated from working capital items. Cash used in investing activities was $44.8 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to $22.9 million for the nine months ended January 1, 2022. The increase in cash used for investing activities was related to net cash paid for acquisitions and higher capital expenditures to support plant expansion and ongoing maintenance.

See accompanying Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 5 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consoli dated Financial Statements 1. Basis of Presentation and Business Nature of Operations: Skyline Champion Corporation's (the “Company”) operations consist of manufacturing, retail and transportation activities. At October 1, 2022, the Company operated 37 manufacturing facilities throughout the United States (“U.S.”) and five manufacturing facilities in western Canada that primarily construct factory-built, timber-framed manufactured and modular houses that are sold primarily to independent retailers, builders/developers, and manufactured home community operators. In addition to its core home building business, the Company provides construction services to install and set-up factory-built homes. The Company’s retail operations consist of 31 sales centers that sell manufactured houses to consumers across the U.S. The Company’s transportation business engages independent owners/drivers to transport recreational vehicles throughout the U.S. and Canada and manufactured houses in certain regions of the U.S. The Company also has a holding company located in the Netherlands. Basis of Presentation: The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) for Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Article 10 of SEC Regulation S-X. Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“U.S. GAAP”) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany balances and transactions. In the opinion of management, these statements include all normal recurring adjustments necessary to fairly state the Company’s consolidated results of operations, cash flows, and financial position. The Company has evaluated subsequent events after the balance sheet date through the date of the filing of this report with the SEC. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the SEC on May 24, 2022 (the “Fiscal 2022 Annual Report”). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The condensed consolidated income statements, condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income, and condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations or cash flows for the full year. The Company’s fiscal year is a 52- or 53-week period that ends on the Saturday nearest to March 31. The Company’s current fiscal year, “fiscal 2023,” will end on April 1, 2023 and will include 52 weeks. References to “fiscal 2022” refer to the Company’s fiscal year ended April 2, 2022. The three and six months ended October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021 included 13 and 26 weeks, respectively. The Company’s allowance for credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost reflects management’s estimate of credit losses over the remaining expected life of such assets, measured primarily using historical experience, as well as current economic conditions and forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. Expected credit losses for newly recognized financial assets, as well as changes to expected credit losses during the period, are recognized in earnings. Accounts receivable are reflected net of reserves of $ 1.6 million and $ 1.7 million at October 1, 2022 and April 2, 2022, respectively. At both October 1, 2022 and April 2, 2022, other notes receivable are reflected net of reserves of $ 0.4 million. In May 2022, the Company acquired certain operating assets from Manis Custom Builders, Inc. (""Manis""). In July 2022, the Company acquired 12 retail sales centers from Alta Cima Corporation. The purchase price and net assets acquired for both transactions were not material to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. There were no accounting standards recently issued that are expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations. 2. Inventories, net The components of inventory, net of reserves for obsolete inventory, were as follows: (Dollars in thousands) October 1, 2022 April 2, 2022 Raw materials $ 123,921 $ 141,238 Work in process 27,755 26,523 Finished goods and other 88,775 73,573 Total inventories, net $ 240,451 $ 241,334 6 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued At October 1, 2022 and April 2, 2022 , reserves for obsolete inventory were $ 6.5 million and $ 4.8 million, respectively. 3.

Depreciation is calculated primarily on a straight-line basis, generally over the following estimated useful lives: land improvements – 3 to 10 years; buildings and improvements – 8 to 25 years ; and vehicles and machinery and equipment – 3 to 8 years . Depreciation expense for the three months ended October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021 was $ 4.2 milli on and $ 3.3 million, respectively.

Debt and Floor Plan Payable Long-term debt consisted of the following: (Dollars in thousands) October 1, 2022 April 2, 2022 Obligations under industrial revenue bonds due 2029 $ 12,430 $ 12,430 Revolving credit facility maturing in 2026 — — Total long-term debt $ 12,430 $ 12,430 On July 7, 2021, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with a syndicate of banks that provides for a revolving credit facility of up to $ 200.0 million, including a $ 45.0 million letter of credit sub-facility (""Amended Credit Agreement""). The Amended Credit Agreement replaced the Company's previously existing $ 100.0 million revolving credit facility. Outstanding borrowings of $ 26.9 million on the Company's previous revolving credit facility were repaid in July 2021. The Amended Credit Agreement allows the Company to draw down, repay and re-draw loans on the available facility during the term, subject to certain terms and conditions, matures in July 2026 , and has no scheduled amortization. The Company capitalized $ 1.1 million of deferred financing fees associated with the Amended Credit Agreement, which are included in other noncurrent assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The Company wrote off $ 0.3 million of deferred financing fees associated with the previously existing credit facility during the second quarter of fiscal 2022. 8 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued The interest rate on borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement adjusts based on the consolidated total net leverage of the Company from a high of the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate ("" LIBOR"") or the Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus the benchmark replacement adjustment (""Replacement Rate"") plus 1.875 % and Alternative Base Rate ("" ABR"") plus 0.875 %, at the election of the Company, when the consolidated total net leverage ratio is equal to or greater than 2.25 :1.00, to a low of LIBOR or the Replacement Rate plus 1.125 % and ABR plus 0.125 % when the consolidated total net leverage is below 0.50:1.00. In addition, the Company is obligated to pay an unused line fee ranging between 0.15 % and 0.3 % (depending on the consolidated total net leverage ratio) in respect of unused commitments under the Amended Credit Agreement. There were no outstanding borrowings under the revo lving credit facility at October 1, 2022 and April, 2, 2022, respectively. At October 1, 2022 the interest rate under the Amended Credit Agreement was 4.28% and letters of credit issued under the Amended Credit Agreement totaled $ 32.1 million. Available borrowing capacity under the Amended Credit Agreement as of October 1, 2022 was $ 167.9 million. Obligations under industrial revenue bonds are supported by letters of credit and bear interest based on a municipal bond index rate. The weighted-average interest rate at October 1, 2022, including related costs and fees, was 4.17 %. T he industrial revenue bonds require lump-sum payments of principal upon maturity in 2029 . The Amended Credit Agreement contains covenants that restrict the amount of additional debt, liens and certain payments, including equity buybacks, investments, dispositions, mergers and consolidations, among other restrictions as defined. The Company was in compliance with all covenants of the Amended Credit Agreement as of October 1, 2022. Floor Plan Payable The Company’s retail operations utilize floor plan financing to fund the purchase of manufactured homes for display or resale. At October 1, 2022 and April 2, 2022, the Company had outstanding borrowings on floor plan financing agreements of $ 38.5 million and $ 35.5 million, respectively. Total credit line capacity provided under the agreements wa s $6 7.0 million as of October 1, 2022 . Borrowings are secured by the homes and are required to be repaid when the Company sells the home to a customer. 9 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued 8.

Income Taxes For the three months ended October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021, the Company recorded $ 48.1 million and $ 16.4 million of income tax expense and had an effective tax rate of 25.0 % and 24.4 % , respectively. For the six months ended October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021, the Company recorded $ 88.5 million and $ 30.4 million of income tax expense and had an effective tax rate of 25.3 % and 24.5 % , respectively. The Company’s effective tax rate for the three and six months ended October 1, 2022 differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of 21.0 % due primarily to the effect of state and local income taxes, non-deductible expenses, tax credits, and results in foreign jurisdictions. The Company’s effective tax rate for the three and six months ended October 2, 2021 differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of 21.0 % due primarily to the effect of state and local income taxes, non-deductible expenses, tax credits, results in foreign jurisdictions and tax benefits from vested equity compensation. At October 1, 2022 , the Company had no unrecognized tax benefits. The Company does not anticipate any material changes to uncertain tax benefits in the next 12 months. The Company records interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. 10 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued 10. Earnings Per Share Basic net income per share (“EPS”) attributable to the Company was computed by dividing net income attributable to the Company by the average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated using our weighted-average outstanding common shares including the dilutive effect of stock awards as determined under the treasury stock method. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share: Three months ended Six months ended (Dollars and shares in thousands, except per share data) October 1, 2022 October 2, 2021 October 1, 2022 October 2, 2021 Numerator: Net income attributable to the Company's common shareholders $ 144,092 $ 50,723 $ 261,243 $ 93,624 Denominator: Basic weighted-average shares outstanding 56,956 56,808 56,933 56,757 Dilutive securities 450 400 431 455 Diluted weighted-average shares outstanding 57,406 57,208 57,364 57,212 Basic net income per share $ 2.53 $ 0.89 $ 4.59 $ 1.65 Diluted net income per share $ 2.51 $ 0.89 $ 4.55 $ 1.64 11. Segment Information Financial results for the Company's reportable segments have been prepared using a management approach, which is consistent with the basis and manner in which financial information is evaluated by the Company's chief operating decision maker in allocating resources and in assessing performance. The Company’s chief operating decision maker, the Chief Executive Officer, evaluates the performance of the Company’s segments primarily based on net sales, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (“EBITDA”) and operating assets. The Company operates in two reportable segments: (i) U.S. Factory-built Housing, which includes manufacturing and retail housing operations and (ii) Canadian Factory-built Housing. Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation operations, corporate costs incurred for all segments and intersegment eliminations. Segments are generally determined by geography. Segment data includes intersegment revenues and corporate office costs that are directly and exclusively incurred for each segment. Total assets for Corporate/Other primarily includes cash and U.S. deferred tax items not specifically allocated to another segment. 11 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued Selected financial information by reportable segment was as follows: Three months ended Six months ended (Dollars in thousands) October 1, 2022 October 2, 2021 October 1, 2022 October 2, 2021 Net sales: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 754,237 $ 471,699 $ 1,415,318 $ 929,019 Canadian Factory-built Housing 39,198 38,501 84,260 76,332 Corporate/Other 13,390 14,025 33,128 29,071 Consolidated net sales $ 806,825 $ 524,225 $ 1,532,706 $ 1,034,422 Operating income: U.S. Factory-built Housing EBITDA $ 199,284 $ 78,075 $ 360,849 $ 141,092 Canadian Factory-built Housing EBITDA 10,141 6,390 21,468 12,056 Corporate/Other EBITDA ( 12,293 ) ( 11,351 ) ( 21,882 ) ( 17,328 ) Other expense (income) — 11 ( 634 ) ( 43 ) Depreciation ( 4,166 ) ( 3,264 ) ( 7,836 ) ( 6,521 ) Amortization ( 2,775 ) ( 1,874 ) ( 4,721 ) ( 3,762 ) Consolidated operating income $ 190,191 $ 67,987 $ 347,244 $ 125,494 Depreciation: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 3,505 $ 2,619 $ 6,542 $ 5,229 Canadian Factory-built Housing 345 273 626 558 Corporate/Other 316 372 668 734 Consolidated depreciation $ 4,166 $ 3,264 $ 7,836 $ 6,521 Amortization of U.S. Factory-built Housing intangible assets: $ 2,775 $ 1,874 $ 4,721 $ 3,762 Capital expenditures: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 14,778 $ 5,269 $ 23,711 $ 12,527 Canadian Factory-built Housing 1,068 236 1,429 341 Corporate/Other 332 379 473 2,237 Consolidated capital expenditures $ 16,178 $ 5,884 $ 25,613 $ 15,105 (Dollars in thousands) October 1, 2022 April 2, 2022 Total Assets: U.S. Factory-built Housing (1) $ 724,859 $ 695,500 Canadian Factory-built Housing (1) 115,188 107,459 Corporate/Other (1) 667,571 431,660 Consolidated total assets $ 1,507,618 $ 1,234,619 12. Commitments, Contingencies and Legal Proceedings Repurchase Contingencies and Guarantees The Company is contingently liable under terms of repurchase agreements with lending institutions that provide wholesale floor plan financing to retailers. These arrangements, which are customary in the manufactured housing industry, provide for the repurchase of products sold to retailers in the event of default by the retailer on its agreement to pay the financial institution. The risk of loss from these agreements is significantly reduced by the potential resale value of any products that are subject to repurchase and is spread over numerous retailers. The repurchase price is generally determined by the original sales price of the product less contractually defined curtailment payments. Based on these repurchase agreements and our historical loss experience, we establish an associated loss reserve which was $ 2.6 million and $ 2.3 million at October 1, 2022 and April 2, 2022, respectively. Excluding the resale value of the homes, the contingent repurchase obligation as of October 1, 2022 was estimated to b e $ 395.6 million. Losses incurred on homes repurchased were not significant during the three and six months ended October 1, 2022 or October 2, 2021. 12 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued At October 1, 2022 , the Company was contingently obligated for $ 32.1 million under letters of credit, primarily consisting of $ 12.6 million to support long-term debt, $ 19.2 million to support the casualty insurance program, and $ 0.3 million to support bonding agreements. The letters of credit are issued from a sub-facility of the Amended Credit Agreement. The Company was also contingently obligated for $ 30.4 million under surety bonds, generally to support performance on long-term construction contracts and license and service bonding requirements. The Company has received claims for damage related to water intrusion in homes built in one of its manufacturing facilities. The Company is investigating the cause of the damage and assessing its responsibility to remediate. While it is reasonably possible that the Company will receive future claims that could result in additional costs to repair that could be significant in the aggregate, the Company is unable to estimate the number of such claims or the amount or range of any potential losses associated with such claims at this time. In the normal course of business, the Company’s former subsidiaries that operated in the United Kingdom historically provided certain guarantees to two customers. Those guarantees provide contractual liability for proven construction defects up to 12 years from the date of delivery of certain products. The guarantees remain a contingent liability of the Company which declines over time through October 2027. As of the date of this report, the Company expects few, if any, claims to be reported under the terms of the guarantees. Legal Proceedings The Company has agreed to indemnify counterparties in the ordinary course of its business in agreements to acquire and sell business assets and in financing arrangements. The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of its business. As of the date of this filing, the Company believes the ultimate liability with respect to these contingent obligations will not have, either individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 13 Item 2. MANAGEMENT’ S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following should be read in conjunction with Skyline Champion Corporation’s condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear in Item 1 of this Report. Overview Skyline Champion Corporation (the “Company”) is a leading producer of factory-built housing in the U.S. and Canada. The Company serves as a complete solutions provider across complementary and vertically integrated businesses including company-owned retail locations, transportation logistics services, and construction services to install and set-up factory-built homes. The Company markets its homes under several nationally recognized brand names including Skyline Homes, Champion Home Builders, Genesis Homes, Athens Park Models, Dutch Housing, Atlantic Homes, Excel Homes, Homes of Merit, New Era, Redman Homes, ScotBilt Homes, Shore Park, Silvercrest, and Titan Homes in the U.S., and Moduline and SRI Homes in western Canada. The Company operates 37 manufacturing facilities throughout the U.S. and five manufacturing facilities in western Canada that primarily construct factory-built, timber-framed, manufactured and modular houses that are sold primarily to independent retailers, builders/developers, and manufactured home community operators. The Company’s retail operations consist of 31 sales centers that sell manufactured homes to consumers across the U.S. The Company’s transportation business engages independent owners/drivers to transport manufactured homes, recreational vehicles, and other products throughout the U.S. and Canada. Acquisitions and Expansions Over the last several years, demand for the Company’s products, primarily affordable housing in the U.S., has continued to improve. As a result, the Company has focused on operational improvements to increase capacity utilization and profitability at its existing manufacturing facilities as well as executing measured expansion of its manufacturing and retail footprint through facility and equipment investments and acquisitions. The Company continues to focus on growing in strong housing markets across the U.S. and Canada, as well as expanding products and services to provide more wholistic solutions to homebuyers. In July 2022, the Company acquired 12 retail sales centers from Alta Cima Corporation, which expanded the internal retail network across a broader portion of the U.S. In May 2022, the Company acquired Manis Custom Builders, Inc. (""Manis"") in order to expand its manufacturing footprint and further streamline its product offering in the Southeast U.S. On February 28, 2021, the Company acquired ScotBilt Homes, LLC and related companies (collectively, ""Scotbilt""), which operated two manufacturing facilities in Georgia providing affordable housing throughout Alabama, Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas. The ScotBilt acquisition complemented the Company’s prior manufacturing footprint in the attractive mid-south region. The Company is also focused on increasing its U.S. manufacturing capacity through various plant start-ups. In June 2021, the Company acquired two idle facilities in Navasota, Texas in order to increase its production capabilities in the Texas market. The Company completed the certification process and began production at one of those facilities during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. In January 2021, the Company acquired two idle facilities in Pembroke, North Carolina, and is currently renovating one of those facilities for expected production in late fiscal 2023. The Company is also in the process of opening a previously idled facility in Bartow, Florida and is expecting production to begin in fiscal 2024. The Company's acquisitions and investments are part of a strategy to grow and diversify revenue with a focus on increasing the Company’s homebuilding presence in the U.S. as well as improving the results of operations. These acquisitions and investments are included in the Company's consolidated results for periods subsequent to their respective acquisition dates. Industry and Company Outlook Since July 2020, the U.S. and Canadian housing industry demand has generally been robust. The limited availability of existing homes for sale and the broader need for newly built affordable, single-family housing has driven demand for new homes in those markets. In recent years, manufactured home construction experienced revenue growth due to a number of favorable demographic trends and demand drivers in the U.S., including underlying growth trends in key homebuyer groups, such as the population over 55 years of age, the population of first-time homebuyers, and the population of households earning less than $60,000 per year. More recently, we have seen a number of market trends pointing to increased sales of accessory dwelling units (""ADUs"") and urban-to-rural migration as customers accommodate working-from-home patterns, as well as people seeking rent-to-own single-family options. Recent increases in interest rates in response to inflation began to impact the demand for the Company's products in both the U.S. and Canada in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Incoming orders from our customers decreased compared to the same quarter last year. In addition, our independent retail customers have cancelled stock-model orders in response to the increase in floor plan carrying costs and the desire to optimize their model home inventory based on rising interest rates. The Company's backlog was $0.8 billion as of October 1, 2022 compared to $1.4 billion as of October 2, 2021. The decrease in backlog is due to the year-over-year decrease in net orders and the increase in production volumes during the second quarter fiscal 2023 compared to the same quarter last year. Cancellation of end-consumer orders, at the retail level, have been minimal. 14 The robust demand for housing in 2021 and the first half of 2022 resulted in significant increases in certain raw material and labor costs. Although we have seen recent improvements in the raw material supply chain, we continue to experience intermittent disruption and higher freight costs. Finding and retaining qualified labor continues to be a challenge for our plants which requires us to monitor our compensation programs and adjust accordingly. We manage our business to anticipate or quickly react to these supply challenges and cost increases and generally are able to pass along increased costs to our customers. For the six months ended October 1, 2022, approximately 86% of the Company’s U.S. manufacturing sales were generated from the manufacture of homes that comply with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (""HUD"") code construction standard in the U.S. Industry shipments of HUD-code homes are reported on a one-month lag. According to data reported by the Manufactured Housing Institue, HUD-code industry home shipments were 30,130 and 26,085 units during the three months ended August 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Based on industry data, the Company’s U.S. wholesale market share of HUD code homes sold was 22.5% and 19.0%, for the three months ended August 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Annual HUD-code industry shipments have generally increased each year since calendar year 2009 when only 50,000 HUD-coded manufactured homes were shipped, the lowest level since the industry began recording statistics in 1959. While shipments of HUD-coded manufactured homes have improved modestly in recent years, manufactured housing’s most recent annual shipment levels still operate at lower levels than the long-term historical average of over 200,000 units annually. UNAUDITED INCOME STATEMENTS FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2023 VS. 2022 Three months ended (Dollars in thousands) October 1, 2022 October 2, 2021 Results of Operations Data: Net sales $ 806,825 $ 524,225 Cost of sales 532,719 394,898 Gross profit 274,106 129,327 Selling, general, and administrative expenses 83,915 61,340 Operating income 190,191 67,987 Interest (income) expense, net (1,974 ) 845 Other expense — 11 Income before income taxes 192,165 67,131 Income tax expense 48,073 16,408 Net income $ 144,092 $ 50,723 Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA: Net income $ 144,092 $ 50,723 Income tax expense 48,073 16,408 Interest (income) expense, net (1,974 ) 845 Depreciation and amortization 6,941 5,138 Adjusted EBITDA $ 197,132 $ 73,114 As a percent of net sales: Gross profit 34.0 % 24.7 % Selling, general, and administrative expenses 10.4 % 11.7 % Operating income 23.6 % 13.0 % Net income 17.9 % 9.7 % Adjusted EBITDA 24.4 % 13.9 % 15 NET SALES The following table summarizes net sales for the three months ended October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021: Three months ended (Dollars in thousands) October 1, 2022 October 2, 2021 $ Change % Change Net sales $ 806,825 $ 524,225 $ 282,600 53.9 % U.S. manufacturing and retail net sales $ 754,237 $ 471,699 $ 282,538 59.9 % U.S. homes sold 7,274 5,902 1,372 23.2 % U.S. manufacturing and retail average home selling price $ 103.7 $ 79.9 $ 23.8 29.8 % Canadian manufacturing net sales $ 39,198 $ 38,501 $ 697 1.8 % Canadian homes sold 303 358 (55 ) (15.4 %) Canadian manufacturing average home selling price $ 129.4 $ 107.5 $ 21.9 20.4 % Corporate/Other net sales $ 13,390 $ 14,025 $ (635 ) (4.5 %) U.S. manufacturing facilities in operation at end of period 37 35 U.S. retail sales centers in operation at end of period 31 18 Canadian manufacturing facilities in operation at end of period 5 5 Net sales for the three months ended October 1, 2022 were $806.8 million, an increase of $282.6 million, or 53.9%, over the three months ended October 1, 2022. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. U.S. Factory-built Housing: Net sales for the Company’s U.S. manufacturing and retail operations increased by $282.5 million, or 59.9%, for the three months ended October 1, 2022 compared to the three months ended October 2, 2021. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of homes sold during the three months ended October 1, 2022 of 23.2%, as well as an increase in the average home selling price of 29.8%. The increase in the number of homes sold was a result of additional capacity from recent acquisitions and expansions, Federal Emergency Management Agency (""FEMA"") Disaster Relief housing sales of $117.8 million during the quarter, and increased production output from our existing facilities. The average selling price increase was due, in part, to the impact of sales to FEMA as well as pricing actions enacted on our core products in response to rising material, freight, and labor costs. FEMA units generally have more specifications than our typical products and therefore drive a higher average selling price per home. Generally, we have been able to pass the increase in input costs to our customers. Canadian Factory-built Housing: The Canadian Factory-built Housing segment net sales increased by $0.7 million, or 1.8% for the three months ended October 1, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year, primarily due to a 20.4% increase in average home selling price, partially offset by a 15.4% decrease in homes sold. The increase in average selling price was due to pricing actions enacted in response to rising material and labor costs. The decrease in homes sold is due to slowing housing demand in certain regions of Canada and a shift in mix. On a constant currency basis, net sales for the Canadian segment were unfavorably impacted by approximately $1.5 million due to fluctuations in the translation of the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar during the three months ended October 1, 2022, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. Corporate/Other: Net sales for Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation business and the elimination of intersegment sales. For the three months ended October 1, 2022, net sales decreased $0.6 million, or 4.5%, primarily attributable to the decrease in RV shipment revenue. 16 GROSS PROFIT The following table summarizes gross profit for the three months ended October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021: Three months ended (Dollars in thousands) October 1, 2022 October 2, 2021 $ Change % Change Gross profit: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 256,744 $ 116,604 $ 140,140 120.2 % Canadian Factory-built Housing 13,170 8,868 4,302 48.5 % Corporate/Other 4,192 3,855 337 8.7 % Total gross profit $ 274,106 $ 129,327 $ 144,779 111.9 % Gross profit as a percent of net sales 34.0 % 24.7 % Gross profit as a percent of sales during the three months ended October 1, 2022 was 34.0% compared to 24.7% during the three months ended October 2, 2021. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. U.S. Factory-built Housing: Gross profit for the U.S. Factory-built Housing segment increased by $140.1 million, or 120.2%, during the three months ended October 1, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. Gross profit was 34.0% as a percent of segment net sales for the three months ended October 1, 2022 compared to 24.7% in the same period of the prior fiscal year. The increase in gross profit was due to a combination of higher volumes and higher average selling prices for our products as well as lower forest product costs compared to the same period last year. Sales to FEMA during the second quarter of fiscal 2023 also helped improve margins since these sales are generally at higher prices than our core product which helps offset the disruption to our operations and our customers. Canadian Factory-built Housing: Gross profit for the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment increased by $4.3 million, or 48.5% during the three months ended October 1, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. Gross profit as a percent of net sales was 33.6% for the three months ended October 1, 2022, compared to 23.0% in the same period of the prior year. The increase in gross profit is primarily due to higher average selling prices for our products and lower costs for forest products compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Corporate/Other: Gross profit for the Corporate/Other segment increased $0.3 million, or 8.7%, during the three months ended October 1, 2022 compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. Gross profit increased as a percent of segment net sales to 31.3% from 27.5% as a result of changes in revenue mix. SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Selling, general, and administrative expenses include foreign currency transaction gains and losses, equity compensation, and intangible amortization expense. The following table summarizes selling, general, and administrative expenses for the three months ended October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021: Three months ended (Dollars in thousands) October 1, 2022 October 2, 2021 $ Change % Change Selling, general, and administrative expenses: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 63,741 $ 43,014 $ 20,727 48.2 % Canadian Factory-built Housing 3,373 2,751 622 22.6 % Corporate/Other 16,801 15,575 1,226 7.9 % Total selling, general, and administrative expenses $ 83,915 $ 61,340 $ 22,575 36.8 % Selling, general, and administrative expense as a percent of net sales 10.4 % 11.7 % Selling, general, and administrative expenses were $83.9 million for the three months ended October 1, 2022, an increase of $22.6 million, or 36.8%, compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. 17 U.S. Factory-built Housing: Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the U.S. Factory-built Housing segment increased $20.7 million, or 48.2%, during the three months ended October 1, 2022 as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. Selling, general, and administrative expenses, as a percent of segment net sales decreased to 8.5% for the three months ended October 1, 2022 compared to 9.1% during the comparable period of the prior fiscal year primarily due to higher revenue and increased leverage of fixed costs. The increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses resulted from higher sales commissions and incentive compensation which is generally based on sales volume or a measure of profitability, higher wages and related expenses from headcount increases in response to increased production levels, and from added selling and administrative costs for our business expansions. Canadian Factory-built Housing: Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment increased $0.6 million, or 22.6%, for the three months ended October 1, 2022 when compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percent of segment net sales increased to 8.6% for the three months ended October 1, 2022 compared to 7.1% during the comparable period of the prior fiscal year. The increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses is primarily due to higher incentive compensation related to the increase in segment profitability. Corporate/Other: Selling, general, and administrative expenses for Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation operations, corporate costs incurred for all segments, and intersegment eliminations. Selling, general, and administrative expenses for Corporate/Other increased $1.2 million, or 7.9%, during the three months ended October 1, 2022 as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year due to increase in equity and variable compensation and foreign currency transaction losses. INTEREST (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET The following table summarizes the components of interest (income) expense, net for the three months ended October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021: Three months ended (Dollars in thousands) October 1, 2022 October 2, 2021 $ Change % Change Interest expense $ 992 $ 993 $ (1 ) (0.1 %) Less: interest income (2,966 ) (148 ) (2,818 ) 1,904.1 % Interest (income) expense, net $ (1,974 ) $ 845 $ (2,819 ) (333.6 %) Average outstanding floor plan payable $ 37,086 $ 29,300 Average outstanding long-term debt $ 12,430 $ 12,430 Interest, net was $2.0 million of income for the three months ended October 1, 2022, compared to $0.8 million of expense in the same period of the prior fiscal year. The change was primarily due to higher interest income during the second quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the prior year. Higher interest rates and higher invested cash balances versus the comparable period were the primary drivers of the increase in interest income. INCOME TAX EXPENSE The following table summarizes income tax expense for the three months ended October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021: Three months ended (Dollars in thousands) October 1, 2022 October 2, 2021 $ Change % Change Income tax expense $ 48,073 $ 16,408 $ 31,665 193.0 % Effective tax rate 25.0 % 24.4 % Income tax expense for the three months ended October 1, 2022 was $48.1 million, representing an effective tax rate of 25.0%, compared to income tax expense of $16.4 million, representing an effective tax rate of 24.4%, for the three months ended October 2, 2021. 18 The Company’s effective tax rate for the three months ended October 1, 2022 differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of 21.0% due primarily to the effect of state and local income taxes, non-deductible expenses, tax credits, and results in foreign jurisdictions. The Company’s effective tax rate for the three months ended October 2, 2021 differed from the federal statutory income tax rate of 21.0% due primarily to the effect of state and local income taxes, non-deductible expenses, tax credits, results in foreign jurisdictions, and tax benefits from vested equity compensation. ADJUSTED EBITDA The following table reconciles net income, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, to Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the three months ended October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021: Three months ended (Dollars in thousands) October 1, 2022 October 2, 2021 $ Change % Change Net income $ 144,092 $ 50,723 $ 93,369 184.1 % Income tax expense 48,073 16,408 31,665 193.0 % Interest (income) expense, net (1,974 ) 845 (2,819 ) * Depreciation and amortization 6,941 5,138 1,803 35.1 % Adjusted EBITDA $ 197,132 $ 73,114 $ 124,018 169.6 % * indicates that the calculated percentage is not meaningful Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended October 1, 2022 was $197.1 million, an increase of $124.0 million from the same period of the prior fiscal year. The increase is primarily a result of higher operating income due to increases in sales volume, average selling prices and gross margins, partially offset by higher SG&A expenses. UNAUDITED INCOME STATEMENTS FOR THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2023 VS. 2022 Six months ended (Dollars in thousands) October 1, 2022 October 2, 2021 Results of Operations Data: Net sales $ 1,532,706 $ 1,034,422 Cost of sales 1,029,265 793,565 Gross profit 503,441 240,857 Selling, general, and administrative expenses 156,197 115,363 Operating income 347,244 125,494 Interest (income) expense, net (1,884 ) 1,494 Other income (634 ) (43 ) Income before income taxes 349,762 124,043 Income tax expense 88,519 30,419 Net income $ 261,243 $ 93,624 Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA: Net income $ 261,243 $ 93,624 Income tax expense 88,519 30,419 Interest (income) expense, net (1,884 ) 1,494 Depreciation and amortization 12,557 10,283 Transaction costs 338 — Other (973 ) — Adjusted EBITDA $ 359,800 $ 135,820 As a percent of net sales: Gross profit 32.8 % 23.3 % Selling, general, and administrative expenses 10.2 % 11.2 % Operating income 22.7 % 12.1 % Net income 17.0 % 9.1 % Adjusted EBITDA 23.5 % 13.1 % 19 NET SALES The following table summarizes net sales for the six months ended October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021: Six months ended (Dollars in thousands) October 1, 2022 October 2, 2021 $ Change % Change Net sales $ 1,532,706 $ 1,034,422 $ 498,284 48.2 % U.S. manufacturing and retail net sales $ 1,415,318 $ 929,019 $ 486,299 52.3 % U.S. homes sold 14,087 12,274 1,813 14.8 % U.S. manufacturing and retail average home selling price $ 100.5 $ 75.7 $ 24.8 32.8 % Canadian manufacturing net sales $ 84,260 $ 76,332 $ 7,928 10.4 % Canadian homes sold 655 743 (88 ) (11.8 %) Canadian manufacturing average home selling price $ 128.6 $ 102.7 $ 25.9 25.2 % Corporate/Other net sales $ 33,128 $ 29,071 $ 4,057 14.0 % U.S. manufacturing facilities in operation at end of period 37 35 U.S. retail sales centers in operation at end of period 31 18 Canadian manufacturing facilities in operation at end of period 5 5 Net sales for the six months ended October 1, 2022 were $1,532.7 million, an increase of $498.3 million, or 48.2%, over the six months ended October 1, 2022. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. U.S. Factory-built Housing: Net sales for the Company’s U.S. manufacturing and retail operations increased by $486.3 million, or 52.3%, for the six months ended October 1, 2022 compared to the six months ended October 2, 2021. The increase was primarily due to a 14.8% increase in the number of homes sold during the period, as well as a 32.8% increase in the average home selling price. The increase in the number of homes sold was a result of utilizing additional capacity from recent acquisitions and expansions, FEMA Disaster Relief housing sales of $200.3 million and increased production output from our existing facilities. The average selling price increase was due, in part, to the impact of sales to FEMA as well as to pricing actions on our core products taken in response to rising material, freight, and labor costs. FEMA units generally have more specifications than our typical products and therefore drive a higher average selling price per home. Canadian Factory-built Housing: The Canadian Factory-built Housing segment net sales increased by $7.9 million, or 10.4% for the six months ended October 1, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year, primarily due to a 25.2% increase in average home selling price, partially offset by an 11.8% decrease in homes sold. The increase in average selling price was due to pricing actions taken in response to rising material and labor costs and a change in product mix. The decrease in homes sold is due to slowing demand in certain regions of Canada and a shift in mix. On a constant currency basis, net sales for the Canadian segment were unfavorably impacted by approximately $2.9 million due to fluctuations in the translation of the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar during the first half of fiscal 2023 as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. Corporate/Other: Net sales for Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation business and the elimination of intersegment sales. For the six months ended October 1, 2022, net sales increased $4.1 million, or 14.0%, primarily attributable to an increase in shipments and an increase in average revenue per mile shipped. GROSS PROFIT The following table summarizes gross profit for the six months ended October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021: Six months ended (Dollars in thousands) October 1, 2022 October 2, 2021 $ Change % Change Gross profit: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 466,381 $ 215,815 $ 250,566 116.1 % Canadian Factory-built Housing 27,965 17,193 10,772 62.7 % Corporate/Other 9,095 7,849 1,246 15.9 % Total gross profit $ 503,441 $ 240,857 $ 262,584 109.0 % Gross profit as a percent of net sales 32.8 % 23.3 % 20 Gross profit as a percent of sales during the six months ended October 1, 2022 was 32.8% compared to 23.3% during the six months ended October 2, 2021. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. U.S. Factory-built Housing: Gross profit for the U.S. Factory-built Housing segment increased by $250.6 million, or 116.1%, during the six months ended October 1, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. Gross profit was 33.0% as a percent of segment net sales for the six months ended October 1, 2022 compared to 23.2% in the same period of the prior fiscal year. The increase in gross profit was due to a combination of higher volumes and sales prices for our products and as well as lower forest-product costs compared to the same period in the prior year. In addition, sales to FEMA during the first half of fiscal 2023 increased margins since these sales are generally at higher prices than our core products, which helps offset the disruption to our operations and our customers. Canadian Factory-built Housing: Gross profit for the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment increased by $10.8 million, or 62.7% during the six months ended October 1, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. Gross profit as a percent of net sales was 33.2% for the six months ended October 1, 2022, compared to 22.5% in the same period of the prior year. The prices of our products increased in response to rising material and labor costs, however, certain input costs, primarily forest products, declined during the period. Corporate/Other: Gross profit for the Corporate/Other segment increased $1.2 million, or 15.9%, during the six months ended October 1, 2022 compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, primarily due to increased net sales in the Company’s transportation operations. Gross profit increased as a percent of segment net sales to 27.5% from 27.0% due to revenue mix. SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Selling, general, and administrative expenses include foreign currency transaction gains and losses, equity compensation, and intangible amortization expense. The following table summarizes selling, general, and administrative expenses for the six months ended October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021: Six months ended (Dollars in thousands) October 1, 2022 October 2, 2021 $ Change % Change Selling, general, and administrative expenses: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 116,795 $ 83,769 $ 33,026 39.4 % Canadian Factory-built Housing 7,122 5,696 1,426 25.0 % Corporate/Other 32,280 25,898 6,382 24.6 % Total selling, general, and administrative expenses $ 156,197 $ 115,363 $ 40,834 35.4 % Selling, general, and administrative expense as a percent of net sales 10.2 % 11.2 % Selling, general, and administrative expenses were $156.2 million for the six months ended October 1, 2022, an increase of $40.8 million, or 35.4%, compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. U.S. Factory-built Housing: Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the U.S. Factory-built Housing segment increased $33.0 million, or 39.4%, during the six months ended October 1, 2022 as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. Selling, general, and administrative expenses, as a percent of segment net sales decreased to 8.3% for the six months ended October 1, 2022 compared to 9.0% during the comparable period of the prior fiscal year primarily due to higher revenue and increased leverage of fixed costs. The increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses resulted from higher sales commissions and incentive compensation which is generally based on sales volume or a measure of profitability, and higher wage and related expenses from headcount increases in response to increased production levels, and from added selling and administrative costs for our business expansions. 21 Canadian Factory-built Housing: Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment increased $1.4 million, or 25.0%, for the six months ended October 1, 2022 when compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percent of segment net sales increased to 8.5% for the six months ended October 1, 2022 compared to 7.5% during the comparable period of the prior fiscal year. The increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses is due to higher incentive compensation related to the increase in segment profitability. Corporate/Other: Selling, general, and administrative expenses for Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation operations, corporate costs incurred for all segments, and intersegment eliminations. Selling, general, and administrative expenses for Corporate/Other increased $6.4 million, or 24.6%, during the six months ended October 1, 2022 as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year due to increases in equity compensation, investments made to enhance our online customer experience and supporting systems, and foreign currency transaction losses. INTEREST (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET The following table summarizes the components of interest (income) expense, net for the six months ended October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021: Six months ended (Dollars in thousands) October 1, 2022 October 2, 2021 $ Change % Change Interest expense $ 1,895 $ 1,801 $ 94 5.2 % Less: interest income (3,779 ) (307 ) (3,472 ) 1,130.9 % Interest (income) expense, net $ (1,884 ) $ 1,494 $ (3,378 ) (226.1 %) Average outstanding floor plan payable $ 37,522 $ 28,946 Average outstanding long-term debt $ 12,430 $ 25,882 Interest, net was $1.9 million of income for the six months ended October 1, 2022, compared to $1.5 million of expense in the same period of the prior fiscal year. The change was primarily due to higher interest income during the first half of fiscal 2023 compared to the first half of the prior year. The increase in interest rates on a higher average invested cash balance over the comparable period caused an increase in interest income. OTHER INCOME The following table summarizes other income for the six months ended October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021: Six months ended (Dollars in thousands) October 1, 2022 October 2, 2021 $ Change % Change Other income $ (634 ) $ (43 ) $ (591 ) 1,374.4 % Other income increased $0.6 million during the six months ended October 1, 2022 as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. During the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company received insurance proceeds for partial settlement of certain Champion Home Builders’ pre-bankruptcy workers compensation claims, which was partially offset by transaction costs incurred for the acquisition of Manis. INCOME TAX EXPENSE The following table summarizes income tax expense for the six months ended October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021: Six months ended (Dollars in thousands) October 1, 2022 October 2, 2021 $ Change % Change Income tax expense $ 88,519 $ 30,419 $ 58,100 191.0 % Effective tax rate 25.3 % 24.5 % 22 Income tax expense for the six months ended October 1, 2022 was $88.5 million, representing an effective tax rate of 25.3%, compared to income tax expense of $30.4 million, representing an effective tax rate of 24.5% for the six months ended October 2, 2021. The Company’s effective tax rate for the six months ended October 1, 2022 differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of 21.0% due primarily to the effect of state and local income taxes, non-deductible expenses, tax credits, and results in foreign jurisdictions. The Company’s effective tax rate for the six months ended October 2, 2021 differed from the federal statutory income tax rate of 21.0% due primarily to the effect of state and local income taxes, non-deductible expenses, tax credits, results in foreign jurisdictions, and tax benefits from vested equity compensation. ADJUSTED EBITDA The following table reconciles net income, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, to Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the six months ended October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021: Six months ended (Dollars in thousands) October 1, 2022 October 2, 2021 $ Change % Change Net income $ 261,243 $ 93,624 $ 167,619 179.0 % Income tax expense 88,519 30,419 58,100 191.0 % Interest (income) expense, net (1,884 ) 1,494 (3,378 ) * Depreciation and amortization 12,557 10,283 2,274 22.1 % Transaction costs 338 — 338 * Other (973 ) — (973 ) * Adjusted EBITDA $ 359,800 $ 135,820 $ 223,980 164.9 % * indicates that the calculated percentage is not meaningful Adjusted EBITDA for the six months ended October 1, 2022 was $359.8 million, an increase of $224.0 million from the same period of the prior fiscal year. The increase is primarily a result of higher operating income due to increases in sales volume, average selling prices and gross margins, partially offset by higher SG&A expenses. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss plus, (a) the provision for income taxes, (b) interest income or expense, net, (c) depreciation and amortization, (d) gain or loss from discontinued operations, (e) restructuring charges and impairment of assets, and (f) other non-operating income and costs, including those for the acquisition and integration or disposition of businesses. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of earnings calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income or loss, net sales, operating income or earnings per share prepared on a U.S. GAAP basis. Adjusted EBITDA does not purport to represent cash flow provided by, or used in, operating activities as defined by U.S. GAAP, which is presented in the Statement of Cash Flows. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, investors should be aware that, in the future, the Company may incur expenses similar to those adjusted for in this presentation. This presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an implication that the Company’s future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items. Adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are: Adjusted EBITDA: Given these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our U.S. GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures only on a supplemental basis. 23 BACKLOG Although orders from customers can be cancelled at any time without penalty, and unfilled orders are not necessarily an indication of future business, the Company’s unfilled U.S. and Canadian manufacturing orders at October 1, 2022 totaled $0.8 billion compared to $1.4 billion at October 2, 2021. The decrease in backlog was primarily driven by higher production rates and lower net orders. Recent increases in interest rates in response to inflation began to impact the demand for the Company's products in both the U.S. and Canada in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Incoming gross orders from our customers decreased compared to the same quarter last year. In addition, our independent retail customers have cancelled stock-model orders in response to the increase in floor plan carrying costs and the desire to optimize their model home inventory based on rising interest rates. Cancellation of end-consumer orders, at that retail level, has been minimal. Liquidity and Capital Resources Sources and Uses of Cash The following table presents summary cash flow information for the six months ended October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021: Six months ended (Dollars in thousands) October 1, 2022 October 2, 2021 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 278,566 $ 88,887 Investing activities (32,291 ) (15,246 ) Financing activities 2,260 (25,553 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents (6,944 ) (411 ) Net increase in cash and cash equivalents 241,591 47,677 Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period 435,413 262,581 Cash and cash equivalents at end of period $ 677,004 $ 310,258 The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and existing cash balances. Cash balances and cash flows from operations for the next year are expected to be adequate to cover working capital requirements, capital expenditures, and strategic initiatives and investments. The Company has an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement which provides for a $200.0 million revolving credit facility, including a $45.0 million letter of credit sub-facility (""Amended Credit Agreement""). At October 1, 2022, $167.9 million was available for borrowing under the Amended Credit Agreement. The Company’s revolving credit facility includes (i) a maximum consolidated total net leverage ratio of 3.25 to 1.00, subject to an upward adjustment upon the consummation of a material acquisition, and (ii) a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.00 to 1.00. The Company anticipates compliance with its debt covenants and projects its level of cash availability to be in excess of cash needed to operate the business for the next year and beyond. In the event operating cash flow and existing cash balances were deemed inadequate to support the Company’s liquidity needs, and one or more capital resources were to become unavailable, the Company would revise its operating strategies. Cash provided by operating activities was $278.6 million for the six months ended October 1, 2022 compared to $88.9 million for the six months ended October 2, 2021. Cash provided by operating activities increased due to higher net income and decreases in accounts receivable and inventory, partially offset by a reduction of accounts payable and accrued expenses. Cash used in investing activities was $32.3 million for the six months ended October 1, 2022 compared to $15.2 million for the six months ended October 2, 2021. The increase in cash used for investing activities was related to net cash paid for acquisitions and higher capital expenditures to support plant expansion and ongoing maintenance. Cash provided by financing activities was $2.3 million for the six months ended October 1, 2022 compared to cash used in financing activities of $25.6 million for the six months ended October 2, 2021. The Company repaid $26.9 million on the revolving credit facility in the prior period.

See accompanying Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 5 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consoli dated Financial Statements 1. Basis of Presentation and Business Nature of Operations: Skyline Champion Corporation's (the “Company”) operations consist of manufacturing, retail and transportation activities. At July 2, 2022, the Company operated 37 manufacturing facilities throughout the United States (“U.S.”) and five manufacturing facilities in western Canada that primarily construct factory-built, timber-framed manufactured and modular houses that are sold primarily to independent retailers, builders/developers, and manufactured home community operators. The Company’s retail operations consist of 19 sales centers that sell manufactured houses to consumers primarily in the Southern U.S. The Company’s transportation business engages independent owners/drivers to transport recreational vehicles throughout the U.S. and Canada and manufactured houses in certain regions of the U.S. The Company also has a holding company located in the Netherlands. Basis of Presentation: The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) for Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Article 10 of SEC Regulation S-X. Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“U.S. GAAP”) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany balances and transactions. In the opinion of management, these statements include all normal recurring adjustments necessary to fairly state the Company’s consolidated results of operations, cash flows, and financial position. The Company has evaluated subsequent events after the balance sheet date through the date of the filing of this report with the SEC. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the SEC on May 24, 2022 (the “Fiscal 2022 Annual Report”). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The condensed consolidated income statements, condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income, and condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations or cash flows for the full year. The Company’s allowance for credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost reflects management’s estimate of credit losses over the remaining expected life of such assets, measured primarily using historical experience, as well as current economic conditions and forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. Expected credit losses for newly recognized financial assets, as well as changes to expected credit losses during the period, are recognized in earnings. Accounts receivable are reflected net of reserves of $ 1.7 million at both July 2, 2022 and April 2, 2022. At both July 2, 2022 and April 2, 2022, other notes receivable are reflected net of reserves of $ 0.4 million. The Company’s fiscal year is a 52- or 53-week period that ends on the Saturday nearest to March 31. The Company’s current fiscal year, “fiscal 2023,” will end on April 1, 2023 and will include 52 weeks. References to “fiscal 2022” refer to the Company’s fiscal year ended April 2, 2022. The three months ended July 2, 2022 and July 3, 2021 each included 13 weeks. In May, 2022, the Company acquired Manis Custom Builders, Inc. (""Manis"") for $ 9.6 million. The net assets acquired were not material to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. There were no accounting standards recently issued that are expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations. 2. Inventories, net The components of inventory, net of reserves for obsolete inventory, were as follows: (Dollars in thousands) July 2, 2022 April 2, 2022 Raw materials $ 133,640 $ 141,238 Work in process 30,531 26,523 Finished goods and other 127,987 73,573 Total inventories, net $ 292,158 $ 241,334 At July 2, 2022 and April 2, 2022 , reserves for obsolete inventory were $ 5.7 million and $ 4.8 million, respectively. 6 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued 3. Property, Plant, and Equipment Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated primarily on a straight-line basis, generally over the following estimated useful lives: land improvements – 3 to 10 years; buildings and improvements – 8 to 25 years ; and vehicles and machinery and equipment – 3 to 8 years . Depreciation expense for the three months ended July 2, 2022 and July 3, 2021 was $ 3.7 milli on and $ 3.3 million, respectively.

The Amended Credit Agreement replaced the Company's previously existing $ 100.0 million revolving credit facility. Outstanding borrowings of $ 26.9 million on the Company's previous revolving credit facility were repaid in July 2021. The Amended Credit Agreement allows the Company to draw down, repay and re-draw loans on the available facility during the term, subject to certain terms and conditions, matures in July 2026 , and has no scheduled amortization. The Company capitalized $ 1.1 million of deferred financing fees associated with the Amended Credit Agreement, which are included in other noncurrent assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The Company wrote off $ 0.3 million of deferred financing fees associated with the previously existing credit facility during the second quarter of fiscal 2022. 8 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued The interest rate on borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement adjusts based on the consolidated total net leverage of the Company from a high of the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate ("" LIBOR"") or the Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus the benchmark replacement adjustment (""Replacement Rate"") plus 1.875 % and Alternative Base Rate ("" ABR"") plus 0.875 %, at the election of the Company, when the consolidated total net leverage ratio is equal to or greater than 2.25 :1.00, to a low of LIBOR or the Replacement Rate plus 1.125 % and ABR plus 0.125 % when the consolidated total net leverage is below 0.50:1.00. In addition, the Company is obligated to pay an unused line fee ranging between 0.15 % and 0.3 % (depending on the consolidated total net leverage ratio) in respect of unused commitments under the Amended Credit Agreement. There were no outstanding borrowings under the revo lving credit facility at July 2, 2022 and April, 2, 2022, respectively. At July 2, 2022 the interest rate under the Amended Credit Agreement was 2.97 % and le tters of credit issued under the Amended Credit Agreement totaled $ 32.1 million. Available borrowing capacity under the Amended Credit Agreement as of July 2, 2022 was $ 167.9 million. Obligations under industrial revenue bonds are supported by letters of credit and bear interest based on a municipal bond index rate. The weighted-average interest rate at July 2, 2022, including related costs and fees, was 2.61 %. The industrial revenue bonds require lump-sum payments of principal upon maturity in 2029 . The Amended Credit Agreement contains covenants that restrict the amount of additional debt, liens and certain payments, including equity buybacks, investments, dispositions, mergers and consolidations, among other restrictions as defined. The Company was in compliance with all covenants of the Amended Credit Agreement as of July 2, 2022. Floor Plan Payable The Company’s retail operations utilize floor plan financing to fund the purchase of manufactured homes for display or resale. At July 2, 2022 and April 2, 2022, the Company had outstanding borrowings on floor plan financing agreements of $ 37.9 million and $ 35.5 million, respectively. Total credit line capacity provided under the agreements was $6 7.0 million as of July 2, 2022 . Borrowings are secured by the homes and are required to be repaid when the Company sells the home to a customer. 8.

The Company’s effective tax rate for the three months ended July 2, 2022 differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of 21.0 % due primarily to the effect of state and local income taxes, non-deductible expenses, tax credits, and results in foreign jurisdictions. The Company’s effective tax rate for the three months ended July 3, 2021 differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of 21.0 % due primarily to the effect of state and local income taxes, non-deductible expenses, tax credits, results in foreign jurisdictions and tax benefits from equity compensation. At July 2, 2022 , the Company had no unrecognized tax benefits. The Company does not anticipate any material changes to uncertain tax benefits in the next twelve months. The Company records interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. 10. Earnings Per Share Basic net income per share (“EPS”) attributable to the Company was computed by dividing net income attributable to the Company by the average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated using our weighted-average outstanding common shares including the dilutive effect of stock awards as determined under the treasury stock method. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share: Three months ended (Dollars and shares in thousands, except per share data) July 2, 2022 July 3, 2021 Numerator: Net income attributable to the Company's common shareholders $ 117,151 $ 42,901 Denominator: Basic weighted-average shares outstanding 56,910 56,706 Dilutive securities 387 497 Diluted weighted-average shares outstanding 57,297 57,203 Basic net income per share $ 2.06 $ 0.76 Diluted net income per share $ 2.04 $ 0.75 11. Segment Information Financial results for the Company's reportable segments have been prepared using a management approach, which is consistent with the basis and manner in which financial information is evaluated by the Company's chief operating decision maker in allocating resources and in assessing performance. The Company’s chief operating decision maker, the Chief Executive Officer, evaluates the performance of the Company’s segments primarily based on net sales, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (“EBITDA”) and operating assets. The Company operates in two reportable segments: (i) U.S. Factory-built Housing, which includes manufacturing and retail housing operations and (ii) Canadian Factory-built Housing. Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation operations, corporate costs incurred for all segments and intersegment eliminations. Segments are generally determined by geography. Segment data includes intersegment revenues and corporate office costs that are directly and exclusively incurred for each segment. Total assets for Corporate/Other primarily includes cash and U.S. deferred tax items not specifically allocated to another segment. 10 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued Selected financial information by reportable segment was as follows: Three months ended (Dollars in thousands) July 2, 2022 July 3, 2021 Net sales: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 661,081 $ 457,320 Canadian Factory-built Housing 45,062 37,831 Corporate/Other 19,738 15,046 Consolidated net sales $ 725,881 $ 510,197 Operating income: U.S. Factory-built Housing EBITDA $ 161,565 $ 63,017 Canadian Factory-built Housing EBITDA 11,327 5,666 Corporate/Other EBITDA ( 9,589 ) ( 5,977 ) Other income ( 634 ) ( 54 ) Depreciation ( 3,670 ) ( 3,257 ) Amortization ( 1,946 ) ( 1,888 ) Consolidated operating income $ 157,053 $ 57,507 Depreciation: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 3,037 $ 2,610 Canadian Factory-built Housing 281 285 Corporate/Other 352 362 Consolidated depreciation $ 3,670 $ 3,257 Amortization of U.S. Factory-built Housing intangible assets: $ 1,946 $ 1,888 Capital expenditures: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 8,933 $ 7,258 Canadian Factory-built Housing 361 105 Corporate/Other 141 1,858 Consolidated capital expenditures $ 9,435 $ 9,221 (Dollars in thousands) July 2, 2022 April 2, 2022 Total Assets: U.S. Factory-built Housing (1) $ 796,260 $ 695,500 Canadian Factory-built Housing (1) 114,485 107,459 Corporate/Other (1) 462,587 431,660 Consolidated total assets $ 1,373,332 $ 1,234,619 12. Commitments, Contingencies and Legal Proceedings Repurchase Contingencies and Guarantees The Company is contingently liable under terms of repurchase agreements with lending institutions that provide wholesale floor plan financing to retailers. These arrangements, which are customary in the manufactured housing industry, provide for the repurchase of products sold to retailers in the event of default by the retailer on its agreement to pay the financial institution. The risk of loss from these agreements is significantly reduced by the potential resale value of any products that are subject to repurchase and is spread over numerous retailers. The repurchase price is generally determined by the original sales price of the product less contractually defined curtailment payments. Based on these repurchase agreements and our historical loss experience, we establish an associated loss reserve which was $ 2.4 million and $ 2.3 million at July 2, 2022 and April 2, 2022, respectively. Excluding the resale value of the homes, the contingent repurchase obligation as of July 2, 2022 was estimated to b e $ 373.6 million. Losses incurred on homes repurchased were not significant during the three months ended July 2, 2022 or July 3, 2021. 11 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued At July 2, 2022 , the Company was contingently obligated for $ 32.1 million under letters of credit, primarily consisting of $ 12.6 million to support long-term debt, $ 19.2 million to support the casualty insurance program, and $ 0.3 million to support bonding agreements. The letters of credit are issued from a sub-facility of the Amended Credit Agreement. The Company was also contingently obligated for $ 35.5 million under surety bonds, generally to support performance on long-term construction contracts and license and service bonding requirements. In the normal course of business, the Company’s former subsidiaries that operated in the United Kingdom historically provided certain guarantees to two customers. Those guarantees provide contractual liability for proven construction defects up to 12 years from the date of delivery of certain products. The guarantees remain a contingent liability of the Company which declines over time through October 2027. As of the date of this report, the Company expects few, if any, claims to be reported under the terms of the guarantees. Legal Proceedings The Company has agreed to indemnify counterparties in the ordinary course of its business in agreements to acquire and sell business assets and in financing arrangements. The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of its business. As of the date of this filing, the Company believes the ultimate liability with respect to these contingent obligations will not have, either individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 12 Item 2. MANAGEMENT’ S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following should be read in conjunction with Skyline Champion Corporation’s condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear in Item 1 of this Report. Overview Skyline Champion Corporation (the “Company”) is a leading producer of factory-built housing in the U.S. and Canada. The Company serves as a complete solutions provider across complementary and vertically integrated businesses including manufactured offsite construction, company-owned retail locations, and transportation logistics services. The Company markets its homes under several nationally recognized brand names including Skyline Homes, Champion Home Builders, Genesis Homes, Athens Park Models, Dutch Housing, Atlantic Homes, Excel Homes, Homes of Merit, New Era, Redman Homes, ScotBilt Homes, Shore Park, Silvercrest, and Titan Homes in the U.S., and Moduline and SRI Homes in western Canada. The Company operates 37 manufacturing facilities throughout the U.S. and five manufacturing facilities in western Canada that primarily construct factory-built, timber-framed, manufactured and modular houses that are sold primarily to independent retailers, builders/developers, and manufactured home community operators. The Company’s retail operations consist of 19 sales centers that sell manufactured homes to consumers primarily in the southern U.S. The Company’s transportation business engages independent owners/drivers to transport manufactured homes, recreational vehicles, and other products throughout the U.S. and Canada. Acquisitions and Expansions Over the last several years, demand for the Company’s products, primarily affordable housing in the U.S., has continued to improve. As a result, the Company has focused on operational improvements to increase capacity utilization and profitability at its existing manufacturing facilities as well as executing measured expansion of its manufacturing footprint through facility and equipment investments and acquisitions. The Company continues to focus on growing in strong housing markets across the U.S. and Canada, as well as expanding products and services to provide more wholistic solutions to homebuyers. In May, 2022, the Company acquired Manis Custom Builders, Inc. (""Manis"") in order to expand its manufacturing footprint and further streamline its product offering in the Southeast U.S. In June, 2021, the Company acquired two idle facilities in Navasota, Texas in order to increase its production capabilities in the Texas market. The Company began production and completed the certification process at one of those facilities during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. On February 28, 2021, the Company acquired ScotBilt, which operated two manufacturing facilities in Georgia providing affordable housing throughout Alabama, Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas. The ScotBilt acquisition complemented the Company’s prior manufacturing footprint in the attractive mid-south region. In January, 2021, the Company acquired two idle facilities in Pembroke, North Carolina which provide an opportunity to further expand its manufacturing footprint in the Southeast markets. The Company is currently renovating one of those facilities for expected production in late fiscal 2023. The Company's acquisitions and investments are part of a strategy to grow and diversify revenue with a focus on increasing the Company’s HUD and modular homebuilding presence in the U.S. as well as improving the results of operations. These acquisitions and investments are included in the Company's consolidated results for periods subsequent to their respective acquisition dates. Industry and Company Outlook Since July 2020, the U.S. and Canadian housing industry demand has been robust. The limited availability of existing homes for sale and the broader need for newly built affordable, single-family housing has continued to drive demand for new homes in these markets. In recent years, manufactured home construction experienced revenue growth due to a number of favorable demographic trends and demand drivers in the United States, including underlying growth trends in key homebuyer groups, such as the population over 55 years of age, the population of first-time homebuyers, and the population of households earning less than $60,000 per year. More recently, we have seen a number of market trends pointing to increased sales of ADUs and urban-to-rural migration as customers accommodate working-from-home patterns, as well as people seeking rent-to-own single-family options. The robust demand environment has resulted in backlog of $1.4 billion as of July 2, 2022 compared to $1.2 billion as of July 3, 2021. Generally higher backlog at our manufacturing facilities creates an opportunity to increase production efficiencies. Although the higher demand brings opportunities, it also has resulted in significant increases in raw material and labor costs. Although we have seen recent improvements, we continue to experience intermittent supply disruption and higher freight costs. Finding and retaining qualified labor continues to be a challenge for our plants which requires us to monitor our compensation programs and adjust accordingly. We manage our business to anticipate or quickly react to these supply challenges and cost increases and generally are able to pass along increased costs to our customers. Generally, order cancellation rates have been very low, but the longer lead-time caused by larger backlogs, rising interest rates and changing prices could result in higher cancellations. During the first quarter, as interest rates increased, independent retailers cancelled a limited number of orders to decrease their inventory carrying costs. 13 For the three months ended July 2, 2022, approximately 86% of the Company’s U.S. manufacturing sales were generated from the manufacture of homes that comply with the Federal HUD code construction standard in the U.S. Industry shipments of HUD-code homes are reported on a one month lag. According to data reported by MHI, HUD-code industry home shipments were 31,894 and 27,857 units during the three months ended May 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Based on industry data, the Company’s U.S. wholesale market share of HUD code homes sold was 18.0% and 18.9%, for the three months ended May 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Annual HUD-code industry shipments have generally increased each year since calendar year 2009 when only 50,000 HUD-coded manufactured homes were shipped, the lowest level since the industry began recording statistics in 1959. While shipments of HUD-coded manufactured homes have improved modestly in recent years, manufactured housing’s most recent annual shipment levels still operate at lower levels than the long-term historical average of over 200,000 units annually. UNAUDITED INCOME STATEMENTS FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2023 VS. 2022 Three months ended (Dollars in thousands) July 2, 2022 July 3, 2021 Results of Operations Data: Net sales $ 725,881 $ 510,197 Cost of sales 496,546 398,667 Gross profit 229,335 111,530 Selling, general, and administrative expenses 72,282 54,023 Operating income 157,053 57,507 Interest expense, net 90 649 Other income (634 ) (54 ) Income before income taxes 157,597 56,912 Income tax expense 40,446 14,011 Net income $ 117,151 $ 42,901 Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA: Net income $ 117,151 $ 42,901 Income tax expense 40,446 14,011 Interest expense, net 90 649 Depreciation and amortization 5,616 5,145 Transaction costs 338 — Other (973 ) — Adjusted EBITDA $ 162,668 $ 62,706 As a percent of net sales: Gross profit 31.6 % 21.9 % Selling, general, and administrative expenses 10.0 % 10.6 % Operating income 21.6 % 11.3 % Net income 16.1 % 8.4 % Adjusted EBITDA 22.4 % 12.3 % 14 NET SALES The following table summarizes net sales for the three months ended July 2, 2022 and July 3, 2021: Three months ended (Dollars in thousands) July 2, 2022 July 3, 2021 $ Change % Change Net sales $ 725,881 $ 510,197 $ 215,684 42.3 % U.S. manufacturing and retail net sales $ 661,081 $ 457,320 $ 203,761 44.6 % U.S. homes sold 6,813 6,372 441 6.9 % U.S. manufacturing and retail average home selling price $ 97.0 $ 71.8 $ 25.2 35.1 % Canadian manufacturing net sales $ 45,062 $ 37,831 $ 7,231 19.1 % Canadian homes sold 352 385 (33 ) (8.6 %) Canadian manufacturing average home selling price $ 128.0 $ 98.3 $ 29.7 30.2 % Corporate/Other net sales $ 19,738 $ 15,046 $ 4,692 31.2 % U.S. manufacturing facilities in operation at end of period 37 35 U.S. retail sales centers in operation at end of period 19 18 Canadian manufacturing facilities in operation at end of period 5 5 Net sales for the three months ended July 2, 2022 were $725.9 million, an increase of $215.7 million, or 42.3%,over the three months ended July 2, 2022. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. U.S. Factory-built Housing: Net sales for the Company’s U.S. manufacturing and retail operations increased by $203.8 million, or 44.6%, for the three months ended July 2, 2022 compared to the three months ended July 3, 2021. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of homes sold during the three months ended July 2, 2022 of 6.9%, as well as an increase in the average home selling price of 35.1%. The increase in the number of homes sold was a result of additional capacity from recent expansions, Federal Emergency Management Agency (""FEMA"") Disaster Relief housing sales of $82.5 million and increased production output from our existing facilities. The average selling price increase was due, in part, to the impact of sales to FEMA as well as due to pricing actions enacted on our core products in response to rising material, freight, and labor costs. FEMA units generally have more specifications than our typical products and therefore drive a higher average selling price per home. Generally, we are able to pass the increase in input costs to our customers. Canadian Factory-built Housing: The Canadian Factory-built Housing segment net sales increased by $7.2 million, or 19.1% for the three months ended July 2, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year, primarily due to a 30.2% increase in average home selling price, partially offset by an 8.6% decrease in homes sold. The increase in average selling price was due to pricing actions enacted in response to rising material and labor costs and change in product mix. The decrease in homes sold is due to the timing of shipments. On a constant currency basis, net sales for the Canadian segment were unfavorably impacted by approximately $1.4 million due to fluctuations in the translation of the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar during the first three months of fiscal 2023 as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. Corporate/Other: Net sales for Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation business and the elimination of intersegment sales. For the three months ended July 2, 2022, net sales increased $4.7 million, or 31.2%, primarily attributable to an increase in shipments and an increase in average revenue per mile shipped. 15 GROSS PROFIT The following table summarizes gross profit for the three months ended July 2, 2022 and July 3, 2021: Three months ended (Dollars in thousands) July 2, 2022 July 3, 2021 $ Change % Change Gross profit: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 209,637 $ 99,211 $ 110,426 111.3 % Canadian Factory-built Housing 14,795 8,325 6,470 77.7 % Corporate/Other 4,903 3,994 909 22.8 % Total gross profit $ 229,335 $ 111,530 $ 117,805 105.6 % Gross profit as a percent of net sales 31.6 % 21.9 % Gross profit as a percent of sales during the three months ended July 2, 2022 was 31.6% compared to 21.9% during the three months ended July 3, 2021. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. U.S. Factory-built Housing: Gross profit for the U.S. Factory-built Housing segment increased by $110.4 million, or 111.3%, during the three months ended July 2, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. Gross profit was 31.7% as a percent of segment net sales for the three months ended July 2, 2022 compared to 21.7%% in the same period of the prior fiscal year. The increase in gross profit was due to price increases implemented in response to rising input costs. Sales to FEMA during the first quarter of fiscal 2023 also helped improve margins since these sales are generally at higher prices than our core product which help offset the disruption to our operations and our customers. Canadian Factory-built Housing: Gross profit for the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment increased by $6.5 million, or 77.7% during the three months ended July 2, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year primarily due to increased sales volume. Gross profit as a percent of net sales was 32.8% for the three months ended July 2, 2022, compared to 22.0% in the same period of the prior fiscal year due to price increases in response to rising material and labor costs. Corporate/Other: Gross profit for the Corporate/Other segment increased $0.9 million, or 22.8%, during the three months ended July 2, 2022 compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, primarily due to increased net sales in the Company’s transportation operations. Gross profit decreased as a percent of segment net sales to 24.8% from 26.5% as a result of changes in revenue mix. SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Selling, general, and administrative expenses include foreign currency transaction gains and losses, equity compensation, and intangible amortization expense. The following table summarizes selling, general, and administrative expenses for the three months ended July 2, 2022 and July 3, 2021: Three months ended (Dollars in thousands) July 2, 2022 July 3, 2021 $ Change % Change Selling, general, and administrative expenses: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 53,054 $ 40,755 $ 12,299 30.2 % Canadian Factory-built Housing 3,749 2,945 804 27.3 % Corporate/Other 15,479 10,323 5,156 49.9 % Total selling, general, and administrative expenses $ 72,282 $ 54,023 $ 18,259 33.8 % Selling, general, and administrative expense as a percent of net sales 10.0 % 10.6 % Selling, general, and administrative expenses were $72.3 million for the three months ended July 2, 2022, an increase of $18.3 million, or 33.8%, compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. 16 U.S. Factory-built Housing: Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the U.S. Factory-built Housing segment increased $12.3 million, or 30.2%, during the three months ended July 2, 2022 as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. Selling, general, and administrative expenses, as a percent of segment net sales decreased to 8.0% for the three months ended July 2, 2022 compared to 8.9% during the comparable period of the prior fiscal year primarily due to higher revenue and increased leverage of fixed costs. The increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses resulted from higher sales commissions and incentive compensation which is generally based on sales volume or a measure of profitability, and higher wage expense from headcount increases due to the growth in housing demand and our business expansion. Canadian Factory-built Housing: Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment increased $0.8 million, or 27.3%, for the three months ended July 2, 2022 when compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percent of segment net sales increased to 8.3% for the three months ended July 2, 2022 compared to 7.8% during the comparable period of the prior fiscal year. The increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses is due to higher incentive compensation related to the increase in sales and gross profit of the segment. Corporate/Other: Selling, general, and administrative expenses for Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation operations, corporate costs incurred for all segments, and intersegment eliminations. Selling, general, and administrative expenses for Corporate/Other increased $5.2 million, or 49.9%, during the three months ended July 2, 2022 as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year due to investments made to enhance our online customer experience and supporting systems, as well as an increase in equity compensation. INTEREST EXPENSE, NET The following table summarizes the components of interest expense, net for the three months ended July 2, 2022 and July 3, 2021: Three months ended (Dollars in thousands) July 2, 2022 July 3, 2021 $ Change % Change Interest expense $ 903 $ 808 $ 95 11.8 % Less: Interest income (813 ) (159 ) (654 ) 411.3 % Interest expense, net $ 90 $ 649 $ (559 ) (86.1 %) Average outstanding floor plan payable $ 38,696 $ 28,592 Average outstanding long-term debt $ 12,430 $ 39,330 Interest expense, net was $0.1 million for the three months ended July 2, 2022, a decrease of $0.6 million, or 86.1%, compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. The net decrease in expense was primarily due to higher interest income during the first quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2022 due to a significant increase in interest rates on our invested cash. OTHER INCOME The following table summarizes other income for the three months ended July 2, 2022 and July 3, 2021: Three months ended (Dollars in thousands) July 2, 2022 July 3, 2021 $ Change % Change Other income $ (634 ) $ (54 ) $ (580 ) 1,074.1 % Other income increased $0.6 million during the three months ended July 2, 2022 as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. The Company received proceeds during the first quarter of fiscal 2023 from an insurance company that related to Champion Home Builders’ pre-bankruptcy workers compensation claims, which was partially offset by transaction costs for the acquisition of Manis. 17 INCOME TAX EXPENSE The following table summarizes income tax expense for the three months ended July 2, 2022 and July 3, 2021: Three months ended (Dollars in thousands) July 2, 2022 July 3, 2021 $ Change % Change Income tax expense $ 40,446 $ 14,011 $ 26,435 188.7 % Effective tax rate 25.7 % 24.6 % Income tax expense for the three months ended July 2, 2022 was $40.4 million, representing an effective tax rate of 25.7%, compared to income tax expense of $14.0 million, representing an effective tax rate of 24.6% for the three months ended July 3, 2021. The Company’s effective tax rate for the three months ended July 2, 2022 differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of 21.0% due primarily to the effect of state and local income taxes, non-deductible expenses, tax credits, and results in foreign jurisdictions. The Company’s effective tax rate for the three months ended July 3, 2021 differed from the federal statutory income tax rate of 21.0% due primarily to the effect of state and local income taxes, non-deductible expenses, tax credits, results in foreign jurisdictions, and tax benefits from equity compensation. 18 ADJUSTED EBITDA The following table reconciles net income, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, to Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the three months ended July 2, 2022 and July 3, 2021: Three months ended (Dollars in thousands) July 2, 2022 July 3, 2021 $ Change % Change Net income $ 117,151 $ 42,901 $ 74,250 173.1 % Income tax expense 40,446 14,011 26,435 188.7 % Interest expense, net 90 649 (559 ) (86.1 %) Depreciation and amortization 5,616 5,145 471 9.2 % Transaction costs 338 — 338 * Other (973 ) — (973 ) * Adjusted EBITDA $ 162,668 $ 62,706 $ 99,962 159.4 % * indicates that the calculated percentage is not meaningful Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended July 2, 2022 was $162.7 million, an increase of $100.0 million from the same period of the prior fiscal year. The increase is primarily a result of higher operating income due to increases in sales volume, average selling prices and gross margins, partially offset by higher SG&A expenses. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss plus, (a) the provision for income taxes, (b) interest expense, net, (c) depreciation and amortization, (d) gain or loss from discontinued operations, (e) restructuring charges and impairment of assets, and (f) other non-operating income and costs, including those for the acquisition and integration or disposition of businesses. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of earnings calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income or loss, net sales, operating income or earnings per share prepared on a U.S. GAAP basis. Adjusted EBITDA does not purport to represent cash flow provided by, or used in, operating activities as defined by U.S. GAAP, which is presented in the Statement of Cash Flows. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, investors should be aware that, in the future, the Company may incur expenses similar to those adjusted for in this presentation. This presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an implication that the Company’s future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items. Adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are: Adjusted EBITDA: Given these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our U.S. GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures only on a supplemental basis. BACKLOG Although orders from customers can be cancelled at any time without penalty, and unfilled orders are not necessarily an indication of future business, the Company’s unfilled U.S. and Canadian manufacturing orders at July 2, 2022 totaled $1.4 billion compared to $1.2 billion at July 3, 2021. The increase in backlog was primarily driven by an increase in average selling price per home in backlog. Increasing production rates to keep pace with orders is limited by individual plant capacity, time to train new employees, employee attendance and availability of materials, including most recently raw material allocations by certain suppliers. 19 Liquidity and Capital Resources Sources and Uses of Cash The following table presents summary cash flow information for the three months ended July 2, 2022 and July 3, 2021: Three months ended (Dollars in thousands) July 2, 2022 July 3, 2021 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 47,422 $ 31,905 Investing activities (18,971 ) (9,219 ) Financing activities 2,056 1,798 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents (2,142 ) 673 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents 28,365 25,157 Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period 435,413 262,581 Cash and cash equivalents at end of period $ 463,778 $ 287,738 The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and existing cash balances. Cash balances and cash flows from operations for the next year are expected to be adequate to cover working capital requirements, capital expenditures, and strategic initiatives and investments. On July 7, 2021, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement which provides for a $200.0 million revolving credit facility, including a $45.0 million letter of credit sub-facility (""Amended Credit Agreement""). At July 2, 2022, $167.9 million was available for borrowing under the Amended Credit Agreement. The Company’s revolving credit facility includes (i) a maximum consolidated total net leverage ratio of 3.25 to 1.00, subject to an upward adjustment upon the consummation of a material acquisition, and (ii) a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.00 to 1.00. The Company anticipates compliance with its debt covenants and projects its level of cash availability to be in excess of cash needed to operate the business for the next year and beyond. In the event operating cash flow and existing cash balances were deemed inadequate to support the Company’s liquidity needs, and one or more capital resources were to become unavailable, the Company would revise its operating strategies. Cash provided by operating activities was $47.4 million for the three months ended July 2, 2022 compared to $31.9 million for the three months ended July 3, 2021. Cash provided by operating activities increased due to higher net income, partially offset by changes in working capital, primarily increases in inventory and accounts receivable related to production activities for the FEMA contract. Cash used in investing activities was $19.0 million for the three months ended July 2, 2022 compared to $9.2 million for the three months ended July 3, 2021. The increase in cash used for investing activities was related to cash paid for the acquisition of Manis. Cash provided by financing activities was $2.1 million for the three months ended July 2, 2022 compared to $1.8 million for the three months ended July 3, 2021. Cash provided by financing in each period was primarily a result of increased borrowings under floor plan financing agreements.

See accompanying Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 5 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consoli dated Financial Statements 1. Basis of Presentation and Business Nature of Operations: Skyline Champion Corporation (the “Company”) is a leading producer of factory-built housing in the United States (“U.S.”) and Canada. The Company’s operations consist of manufacturing, retail, and transportation activities. The Company operates 35 manufacturing facilities throughout the U.S. and five manufacturing facilities in western Canada. These facilities primarily construct factory-built, timber-framed manufactured, and modular houses that are sold primarily to independent retailers, builders/developers, and manufactured home community operators. The Company’s retail operations consist of 18 sales centers that sell manufactured houses to consumers primarily in the Southern U.S. The Company’s transportation business engages independent owners/drivers to transport manufactured homes, recreational vehicles and other products throughout the U.S. and Canada. COVID-19 Government Financial Assistance: The outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (""COVID-19"") was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. Various government programs were announced to provide financial relief for affected businesses, including the Employee Retention Credit under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (""CARES Act"") and state level programs in the United States and the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (""CEWS"") under the COVID-19 Economic Response Plan in Canada. The Company recognized $ 0.2 million and $ 7.0 million of subsidies under these programs during the three and nine months ended December 26, 2020, respectively. The Company’s policy is to account for these subsidies as Other Income in the period in which the related costs are incurred and the Company is reasonably assured to receive payment. In addition, the CARES Act allows for deferring payment of certain payroll taxes. Through December 2020 the Company deferred $ 11.8 million of payroll taxes. The Company paid $ 5.9 million of the deferred payroll taxes in the third quarter of fiscal 2022, with the remaining amount expected to be paid in December 2022. Basis of Presentation: The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) for Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Article 10 of SEC Regulation S-X. Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“U.S. GAAP”) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany balances and transactions. In the opinion of management, these statements include all normal recurring adjustments necessary to fairly state the Company’s consolidated results of operations, cash flows, and financial position. The Company has evaluated subsequent events after the balance sheet date through the date of the filing of this report with the SEC. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the SEC on May 26, 2021 (the “Fiscal 2021 Annual Report”). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The condensed consolidated income statements, condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income, and condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations or cash flows for the full year. The Company’s allowance for credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost reflects management’s estimate of credit losses over the remaining expected life of such assets, measured primarily using historical experience, as well as current economic conditions and forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. Expected credit losses for newly recognized financial assets, as well as changes to expected credit losses during the period, are recognized in earnings. Accounts receivable are reflected net of reserves of $ 1.0 million and $ 0.4 million at January 1, 2022 and April 3, 2021, respectively. At both January 1, 2022 and April 3, 2021, other notes receivable are reflected net of reserves of $ 0.4 million. The Company’s fiscal year is a 52- or 53-week period that ends on the Saturday nearest to March 31. The Company’s current fiscal year, “fiscal 2022,” will end on April 2, 2022 and will include 52 weeks. References to “fiscal 2021” refer to the Company’s fiscal year ended April 3, 2021. The three and nine months ended January 1, 2022 and December 26, 2020 each included 13 and 39 weeks, respectively. There were no accounting standards recently issued that are expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations. 6 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued 2. Business Acquisition ScotBilt Acquisition On February 28, 2021 , the Company acquired 100 % of the membership interests of ScotBilt Homes, LLC and related companies (“ScotBilt”), a builder of manufactured homes with annual revenues of approximately $ 79.0 million, for a purchase price of $ 53.0 million. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, the preliminary purchase price was adjusted for cash held by ScotBilt at the closing date and working capital adjustments resulting in an initial total purchase consideration of $ 54.5 million. In the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company reduced the preliminary purchase price allocation by $ 0.2 million as a result of the final working capital settlement. The Company accounted for the acquisition as a business combination under the acquisition method of accounting provided by FASB ASC 805, Business Combinations (“ASC 805”). As such, the purchase price was allocated to the net assets acquired, inclusive of intangible assets, with the excess fair value recorded to goodwill. The purchase price allocation for this acquisition is preliminary and could change. The preliminary allocation of the purchase price was as follows: (Dollars in thousands) Cash $ 1,521 Trade accounts receivable 2,256 Inventory 6,752 Property, plant, and equipment 10,466 Other assets 1,164 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities ( 7,432 ) Intangibles 21,100 Goodwill 18,449 Total purchase price allocation $ 54,276 Goodwill is primarily attributable to expected synergies from the combination of the companies, including, but not limited to, expected cost synergies through procurement activities and operational improvements through sharing of best practices. Goodwill, which is deductible for income tax purposes, was allocated to the U.S. Factory-built Housing reporting unit. Cash, trade accounts receivable, inventory, other assets, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities were generally stated at historical carrying values given the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities. Intangible assets include $ 13.0 million in customer relationships and $ 8.1 million associated with the ScotBilt trade name and were based on an independent appraisal. The fair value of the customer relationships was determined using the multi-period excess earnings method and the fair value of the trade name was determined using the relief-from-royalty method. The Company estimates that each intangible asset has a weighted average useful life of ten years from the acquisition date. Fair value estimates of property, plant, and equipment were based on independent appraisals, giving consideration to the highest and best use of the assets. Key assumptions used in the appraisals were based on a combination of market, cost, and sales comparison approaches, as appropriate. Level 3 fair value estimates of $ 10.5 million related to property, plant, and equipment and $ 21.1 million related to intangible assets were recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of April 3, 2021. The acquisition of ScotBilt was a taxable business combination. Therefore, the Company’s tax basis in the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed approximate the respective fair values at the acquisition date. 3. Inventories, net The components of inventory, net of reserves for obsolete inventory, were as follows: (Dollars in thousands) January 1, 2022 April 3, 2021 Raw materials $ 108,370 $ 91,916 Work in process 22,644 21,642 Finished goods and other 54,038 52,555 Total inventories, net $ 185,052 $ 166,113 At January 1, 2022 and April 3, 2021, reserves for obsolete inventory were $ 4.4 million and $ 4.6 million, respectively . 7 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued 4. Property, Plant, and Equipment Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated primarily on a straight-line basis, generally over the following estimated useful lives: land improvements – 3 to 10 years; buildings and improvements – 8 to 25 years ; and vehicles and machinery and equipment – 3 to 8 years . Depreciation expense for the three months ended January 1, 2022 and December 26, 2020 was $ 3.3 million and $ 3.0 million, respectively.

The Amended Credit Agreement replaced the Company’s previously existing $ 100.0 million revolving credit facility. Outstanding borrowings of $ 26.9 million on the Company’s previous revolving credit facility were repaid in July 2021. The Amended Credit Agreement allows the Company to draw down, repay and re-draw loans on the available funds during the term, subject to certain terms and conditions, matures in July 2026 and has no scheduled amortization. The Company capitalized $ 1.1 million of deferred financing fees associated with the Amended Credit Agreement, which is included in other noncurrent assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The Company wrote off $ 0.3 million of deferred financing fees associated with the previously existing credit facility, which is included in interest expense, net for the nine months ended January 1, 2022. The interest rate on borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement adjusts based on the consolidated total net leverage of the Company from a high of LIBOR plus 1.875 % and ABR plus 0.875 %, at the election of the Company, when the consolidated total net leverage ratio is equal to or greater than 2.25 :1.00, to a low of LIBOR plus 1.125 % and ABR plus 0.125 % when the consolidated total net leverage is below 0.50:1.00. In addition, the Company is obligated to pay an unused line fee ranging between 0.15 % and 0.3 % (depending on the consolidated total net leverage ratio) in respect of unused commitments under the Amended Credit Agreement. At January 1, 2022 the interest rate under the Amended Credit Agreement was 1.23 %. At January 1, 2022 , letters of credit issued under the Amended Credit Agreement totaled $ 30.4 million and total available borrowings were $ 169.6 million. 9 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued Obligations under industrial revenue bonds are supported by letters of credit and bear interest based on a municipal bond index rate. The weighted-average interest rate at January 1, 2022, including related costs and fees, was 1.78 %. T he industrial revenue bonds require lump-sum payments of principal upon maturity in 2029 . The Amended Credit Agreement contains covenants that restrict the amount of additional debt, liens and certain payments, including equity buybacks, investments, dispositions, mergers and consolidations, among other restrictions as defined. The Company was in compliance with all covenants of the Amended Credit Agreement as of January 1, 2022. Floor Plan Payable The Company’s retail operations utilize floor plan financing to fund the purchase of manufactured homes for display or resale. At January 1, 2022 and April 3, 2021, the Company had outstanding borrowings on floor plan financing agreements of $ 34.3 million and $ 25.7 million, respectively. Total credit line capacity provided under the agreements was $ 57.0 million as of January 1, 2022 . Borrowings are secured by the financed homes and are required to be repaid when the Company sells a financed home to a customer. 10 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued 9.

Income Taxes For the three months ended January 1, 2022 and December 26, 2020 , the Company recorded $ 23.3 million and $ 5.3 million of income tax expense and had an effective tax rate of 25.6 % and 19.7 %, respectively. For the nine months ended January 1, 2022 and December 26, 2020 , the Company recorded $ 53.7 million and $ 15.5 million of income tax expense and had an effective tax rate of 25.0 % and 23.3 %, respectively. During the three months ended December 26, 2020, the Company completed a U.S. research and development (""R&D"") tax credit study for the years 2018 and 2019 that resulted in the recognition of a tax benefit of $ 1.7 million. The Company’s effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended January 1, 2022 differs from the federal statutory rate of 21.0 % due primarily to the effect of state and local income taxes, non-deductible expenses, tax credits, results in foreign jurisdictions, and tax benefits related to equity compensation. The Company’s effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended December 26, 2020 differs from the federal statutory rate of 21.0 % due primarily to the effect of state and local income taxes, non-deductible expenses, tax credits (including the $ 1.7 million R&D credit), and results in foreign jurisdictions. At January 1, 2022 , the Company had no unrecognized tax benefits. The Company does not anticipate any material changes to uncertain tax benefits in the next twelve months. The Company records interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. 11. Earnings Per Share Basic net income per share (“EPS”) attributable to the Company was computed by dividing net income attributable to the Company by the average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Certain of the Company’s time-based restricted share awards were considered participating securities prior to the completion of the vesting period. The vesting for these time-based shares occurred in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. Diluted earnings per common share is computed based on the more dilutive of: (i) the two class method, assuming the participating securities are not exercised or converted; or (ii) the summation of average common shares outstanding and additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential common shares had been issued. During the nine months ended December 26, 2020, the two-class method was more dilutive. The two-class method was not applicable to the computation for the three months ended December 26,2020, or any subsequent periods, as the time-vested restricted share awards were fully vested and no longer considered participating securities. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share: Three months ended Nine months ended (Dollars and shares in thousands, except per share data) January 1, 2022 December 26, 2020 January 1, 2022 December 26, 2020 Numerator: Net income $ 67,622 $ 21,599 $ 161,246 $ 51,013 Undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities — — — ( 62 ) Net income attributable to the Company's common shareholders $ 67,622 $ 21,599 $ 161,246 $ 50,951 Denominator: Basic weighted-average shares outstanding 56,847 56,702 56,787 56,630 Dilutive securities 491 288 498 253 Diluted weighted-average shares outstanding 57,338 56,990 57,285 56,883 Basic net income per share $ 1.19 $ 0.38 $ 2.84 $ 0.90 Diluted net income per share $ 1.18 $ 0.38 $ 2.81 $ 0.90 12 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued 12. Segment Information Financial results for the Company's reportable segments have been prepared using a management approach, which is consistent with the basis and manner in which financial information is evaluated by the Company's chief operating decision maker in allocating resources and in assessing performance. The Company’s chief operating decision maker, the Chief Executive Officer, evaluates the performance of the Company’s segments primarily based on net sales, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (“EBITDA”) and operating assets. The Company operates in two reportable segments: (i) U.S. Factory-built Housing, which includes manufacturing and retail housing operations and (ii) Canadian Factory-built Housing. Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation operations, corporate costs incurred for all segments and intersegment eliminations. Segments are generally determined by geography. Segment data includes intersegment revenues and corporate office costs that are directly and exclusively incurred for each segment. Total assets for Corporate/Other primarily includes cash and certain deferred tax items not specifically allocated to another segment. Selected financial information by reportable segment was as follows: Three months ended Nine months ended (Dollars in thousands) January 1, 2022 December 26, 2020 January 1, 2022 December 26, 2020 Net sales: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 484,319 $ 336,358 $ 1,413,338 $ 868,577 Canadian Factory-built Housing 36,910 26,351 113,242 66,104 Corporate/Other 13,461 14,872 42,532 38,551 Consolidated net sales $ 534,690 $ 377,581 $ 1,569,112 $ 973,232 Operating income: U.S. Factory-built Housing EBITDA $ 98,724 $ 35,538 $ 239,816 $ 88,628 Canadian Factory-built Housing EBITDA 7,571 2,933 19,627 13,790 Corporate/Other EBITDA ( 9,638 ) ( 6,407 ) ( 26,966 ) ( 20,235 ) Other income 7 ( 180 ) ( 36 ) ( 6,993 ) Depreciation ( 3,348 ) ( 3,025 ) ( 9,869 ) ( 8,994 ) Amortization ( 1,902 ) ( 1,361 ) ( 5,664 ) ( 4,082 ) Consolidated operating income $ 91,414 $ 27,498 $ 216,908 $ 62,114 Depreciation: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 2,706 $ 2,378 $ 7,935 $ 7,167 Canadian Factory-built Housing 279 246 837 609 Corporate/Other 363 401 1,097 1,218 Consolidated depreciation $ 3,348 $ 3,025 $ 9,869 $ 8,994 Amortization of U.S. Factory-built Housing intangible assets: $ 1,902 $ 1,361 $ 5,664 $ 4,082 Capital expenditures: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 6,799 $ 1,234 $ 19,070 $ 3,173 Canadian Factory-built Housing 248 312 589 554 Corporate/Other 632 137 3,125 508 Consolidated capital expenditures $ 7,679 $ 1,683 $ 22,784 $ 4,235 (Dollars in thousands) January 1, 2022 April 3, 2021 Total Assets: U.S. Factory-built Housing (1) $ 586,047 $ 578,897 Canadian Factory-built Housing (1) 94,891 87,224 Corporate/Other (1) 387,213 251,781 Consolidated total assets $ 1,068,151 $ 917,902 13 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued 13. Commitments, Contingencies and Legal Proceedings Repurchase Contingencies and Guarantees The Company is contingently liable under terms of repurchase agreements with lending institutions that provide wholesale floor plan financing to retailers. These arrangements, which are customary in the manufactured housing industry, provide for the repurchase of products sold to retailers in the event of default by the retailer on its agreement to pay the financial institution. The risk of loss from these agreements is spread over numerous retailers. The repurchase price is generally determined by the original sales price of the product less contractually defined curtailment payments. Excluding the resale value of the homes, the contingent repurchase obligation as of January 1, 2022 was estimated to be $ 281.7 million . The Company accounts for the guarantees under its repurchase agreements with the retailers’ financing institutions by estimating and deferring a portion of the related product sale that represents the estimated fair value of the repurchase obligation. In addition, the Company has estimated the expected contingent net loss the Company will incur upon resale of any repurchases. These estimates are based on recent historical experience supplemented by management’s assessment of current economic and other conditions affecting retailers for which the Company has a contingent repurchase obligation. Based on these repurchase agreements and historical loss experience, as well as current economic conditions and forecasts that affect the potential loss exposure, a loss reserve of $ 1.8 million and $ 1.4 million was recorded as of January 1, 2022 and April 3, 2021, respectively. Losses incurred on homes repurchased were not significant during the three or nine months ended January 1, 2022 or December 26, 2020. At January 1, 2022, the Company was contingently obligated fo r $ 30.4 million under letters of credit, primarily consisting of $ 12.6 million to support long-term debt, $ 17.5 million to support the casualty insurance program, and $ 0.3 million to su pport bonding agreements. The letters of credit are issued from a sub-facility of the Amended Credit Agreement. The Company was also contingently obligated for $ 35.6 million under surety bonds, generally to support performance on long-term construction contracts and license and service bonding requirements. In the normal course of business, the Company’s former subsidiaries that operated in the United Kingdom historically provided certain guarantees to two customers. Those guarantees provide contractual liability for proven construction defects up to 12 years from the date of delivery of certain products. The guarantees remain a contingent liability of the Company which declines over time through October 2027. As of the date of this report, the Company expects few, if any, claims to be reported under the terms of the guarantees. Legal Proceedings The Company has agreed to indemnify counterparties in the ordinary course of its business in agreements to acquire and sell business assets and in financing arrangements. The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of its business. As of the date of this filing, the Company believes the ultimate liability with respect to these contingent obligations will not have, either individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 14 Item 2. MANAGEMENT’ S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following should be read in conjunction with Skyline Champion Corporation’s condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear in Item 1 of this Report. Overview Skyline Champion Corporation (the “Company”) is a leading producer of factory-built housing in the U.S. and Canada. The Company serves as a complete solutions provider across complementary and vertically integrated businesses including manufactured offsite construction, company-owned retail locations, and transportation logistics services. The Company is the largest independent publicly traded factory-built solutions provider in North America (based on revenue) and markets its homes under several nationally recognized brand names including Skyline Homes, Champion Home Builders, Genesis Homes, Athens Park Models, Dutch Housing, Excel Homes, Homes of Merit, New Era, Redman Homes, ScotBilt Homes, Shore Park, Silvercrest, and Titan Homes in the U.S., and Moduline and SRI Homes in western Canada. The Company operates 35 manufacturing facilities throughout the U.S. and five manufacturing facilities in western Canada that primarily construct factory-built, timber-framed, manufactured and modular houses that are sold mainly to independent retailers, builders/developers, and manufactured home community operators. The Company’s retail operations consist of 18 sales centers that sell manufactured homes to consumers primarily in the southern U.S. The Company’s transportation business engages independent owners/drivers to transport manufactured homes, recreational vehicles, and other products throughout the U.S. and Canada. Industry and Company Outlook Since July 2020, U.S. and Canadian housing demand has been robust. The limited availability of existing homes for sale and the broader need for newly built affordable, single-family housing has continued to drive demand for new homes in these markets. In recent years, manufactured home construction experienced revenue growth due to a number of favorable demographic trends and demand drivers in the U.S., including underlying growth trends in key homebuyer groups, such as the population over 55 years of age, the population of first-time home buyers, and the population of households earning less than $60,000 per year. We have also seen a number of market trends pointing to increased sales of accessory dwelling units and urban-to-rural migration as customers accommodate working-from-home patterns, as well as people seeking rent-to-own single-family options. The robust demand environment has resulted in backlog of $1.5 billion as of January 1, 2022 compared to $488.5 million as of December 26, 2020. Generally higher backlog at our manufacturing facilities creates an opportunity to increase production efficiencies. Although the higher demand brings opportunities, it also has resulted in significant increases in raw material and labor costs. In addition, we are experiencing intermittent supply disruption and higher freight costs. Finding and retaining qualified labor continues to be a challenge for our plants which requires us to review our compensation programs and adjust accordingly. We manage our business to anticipate or quickly react to these supply challenges and cost increases and generally are able to pass along increased costs to our customers. Historically, order cancellation rates have been very low, but the longer lead-time caused by larger backlogs and changing prices could result in higher cancellations in future periods. For the nine months ended January 1, 2022, approximately 78% of the Company’s U.S. manufacturing sales were generated from the manufacture of homes that comply with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (""HUD"") code construction standard in the U.S. Industry shipments of HUD-code homes are reported on a one-month lag. According to data reported by the Manufactured Housing Institute ("" MHI""), HUD-code industry home shipments were 71,281 and 61,492 units during the eight months ended November 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Based on industry data, the Company’s U.S. wholesale market share of HUD code homes sold was 19.4% and 16.2%, for the eight months ended November 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Annual shipments have generally increased each year since calendar year 2009 when only 50,000 HUD-coded manufactured homes were shipped, the lowest level since the industry began recording statistics in 1959. While shipments of HUD-coded manufactured homes have improved modestly in recent years, current manufactured housing shipments are still at lower levels than the long-term historical average of over 200,000 units a year. Acquisitions and Expansions Over the last several years, demand for the Company’s products, primarily affordable housing in the U.S., has continued to improve. As a result, the Company has focused on operational improvements to make existing manufacturing facilities more profitable as well as executing measured expansion of its manufacturing and retail footprints. The Company has increased capacity through strategic acquisitions and expansions of its manufacturing operations. The Company is focused on growing in strong housing markets across the U.S. On June 21, 2021, the Company acquired two idle facilities in Navasota, Texas in order to strengthen its production capabilities in the Texas market. The Company began certification of the manufacturing operations at one of these facilities in the third quarter of fiscal 2022, and expects to begin delivering products from that facility in the fourth fiscal quarter. On February 28, 2021, the Company acquired ScotBilt, which operates two manufacturing facilities in Georgia that provide affordable housing throughout Alabama, Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas. The operations of ScotBilt are included in the financial results of the Company since the date of the acquisition. On January 14, 2021, the Company 15 acquired two idled facilities in Pembroke, North Carolina, which provides an opportunity to further expand its manufacturing footprint in the South and Southeast markets. The Company is currently assessing prospects for initiating production in one or both of these facilities. The Company's acquisitions and investments are part of a strategy to grow and diversify revenue with a focus on increasing the Company’s HUD and modular homebuilding presence in the U.S. as well as improving the results of operations. These acquisitions and investments are included in the Company's consolidated results for periods subsequent to their respective acquisition dates. COVID-19 Pandemic The outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (""COVID-19"") was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. There remains continued uncertainty regarding the extent and duration of the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on the economy, the housing market, and the Company, as well as the Company’s employees, customers, and suppliers. The Company has prioritized the safety and well-being of its employees and customers and has implemented standards to operate in accordance with social-distancing protocols and public health authority guidelines. Beginning in March 2020, the Company took actions to temporarily idle certain facilities in response to government shutdown orders or reduced demand. By late April 2020, most of the temporarily idled manufacturing facilities had reopened, but at reduced production levels due to employee absenteeism, difficulty hiring new team members, and social distancing protocols. During fiscal 2021, the Company experienced intermittent closures due to COVID-19 outbreaks at the facilities or surrounding communities causing higher than normal absenteeism. In the second half of fiscal 2021, the Company was able to increase daily production rates over the levels achieved in the prior fiscal year period as direct labor staffing levels increased and production efficiencies improved. Although the Company has generally been able to navigate the production challenges caused by the pandemic in fiscal 2022, availability of labor and certain materials remain subject to disruption and uncertainty. Prices for key raw materials have experienced increased volatility and, overall, manufacturing costs have trended higher than prior periods. As part of the initial response to the pandemic, the Company offered extended benefits to employees, including increased sick pay and waived premium payments on healthcare benefits for furloughed employees. The Company’s U.S. operations incurred $2.2 million of expense related to the extended benefits during the nine months ended December 26, 2020. Various government programs were enacted to provide financial relief for affected businesses, including the Employee Retention Credit under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (""CARES Act"") in the U.S. and the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (""CEWS"") under the COVID-19 Economic Response Plan in Canada. CEWS provided a cash subsidy of up to 75% of eligible employees’ remuneration, subject to certain criteria. The Company recognized $6.2 million for payroll subsidies under CEWS and $0.6 million for payroll subsidies under the CARES Act during the nine months ended December 26, 2020.

The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. 17 U.S. Factory-built Housing: Net sales for the Company’s U.S. manufacturing and retail operations increased by $148.0 million, or 44.0%, for the three months ended January 1, 2022 compared to the three months ended December 26, 2020. The change was primarily due to an increase in the number of homes sold during the period of 9.2%, an increase in the average home selling price of 31.7%, and the impact of the acquisition of ScotBilt. Demand for our products has increased significantly in recent periods and we have been able to increase production in response to that demand. The average selling price increased during the period due to pricing actions enacted in response to rising material, freight, and labor costs as well as a shift in product mix to larger homes with more features and amenities. Generally, we are able to pass the increase in input costs along to our customers. Canadian Factory-built Housing: The Canadian Factory-built Housing segment net sales increased by $10.6 million, or 40.1% for the three months ended January 1, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year, primarily due to a 5.7% increase in the number of homes sold and a 32.6% increase in average home selling price. The increase in volume was due to an increase in homes sold driven by strong demand. The increase in average selling price was due to pricing actions enacted in response to rising material and labor costs. On a constant currency basis, net sales for the Canadian segment were also favorably impacted by approximately $1.8 million due to fluctuations in the translation of the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar during the three months ended January 1, 2022 as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. Corporate/Other: Net sales for Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation business and the elimination of intersegment sales. For the three months ended January 1, 2022, net sales decreased $1.4 million, or 9.5%, primarily attributable to lower revenue from the shipment of recreational vehicles. GROSS PROFIT The following table summarizes gross profit for the three months ended January 1, 2022 and December 26, 2020: Three months ended (Dollars in thousands) January 1, 2022 December 26, 2020 $ Change % Change Gross profit: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 143,333 $ 62,943 $ 80,390 127.7 % Canadian Factory-built Housing 10,251 5,372 4,879 90.8 % Corporate/Other 3,655 3,469 186 5.4 % Total gross profit $ 157,239 $ 71,784 $ 85,455 119.0 % Gross profit as a percent of net sales 29.4 % 19.0 % Gross profit as a percent of sales during the three months ended January 1, 2022 was 29.4% compared to 19.0% during the three months ended December 26, 2020.

Gross profit was 29.6% as a percent of segment net sales for the three months ended January 1, 2022, compared to 18.7% in the same period of the prior fiscal year. Margin improvement was driven primarily by price increases in response to rising input costs and the timing of certain price adjustments for raw materials under our buying programs. We have also focused on product simplification and material SKU rationalization to improve operational efficiencies to better leverage increased production and manufacturing fixed costs. Canadian Factory-built Housing: Gross profit for the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment increased by $4.9 million, or 90.8%, during the three months ended January 1, 2022, compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year, primarily due to increased sales volume. Gross profit as a percent of net sales was 27.8% for the three months ended January 1, 2022, compared to 20.4% in the same period of the prior fiscal year. Margin improvement was driven by price increases in response to rising material and labor costs, as well as direct labor and manufacturing efficiencies, and increased leverage of manufacturing fixed costs. 18 Corporate/Other: Gross profit for the Corporate/Other segment increased $0.2 million, or 5.4%, during the three months ended January 1, 2022, compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, as a result of changes in revenue mix.

Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percent of segment net sales increased to 10.2% for the three months ended January 1, 2022, compared to 9.3% during the comparable period of the prior fiscal year. The increase in expenses resulted from the following factors: (i) higher sales commissions and incentive compensation, which is generally based on sales volume or a measure of profitability; (ii) higher wage expense from increased headcount as we staffed to respond to the growth in housing demand; and (iii) the impact of the acquisition of the ScotBilt operations. Canadian Factory-built Housing: Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment increased $0.3 million, or 10.3%, for the three months ended January 1, 2022 when compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percent of segment net sales decreased to 8.0% for the three months ended January 1, 2022, compared to 10.2% during the comparable period of the prior fiscal year. The higher expenses are a result of an increase in incentive compensation which is generally based on a measure of profitability. Corporate/Other: Selling, general, and administrative expenses for Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation operations, corporate costs incurred for all segments, and intersegment eliminations. Selling, general, and administrative expenses for Corporate/Other increased $3.4 million, or 32.9%, during the three months ended January 1, 2022, compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, due to an increase in equity compensation, as well as $2.2 million of costs related to investments made to enhance our customer buying experience and supporting systems. 19 INTEREST EXPENSE, NET The following table summarizes the components of interest expense, net for the three months ended January 1, 2022 and December 26, 2020: Three months ended (Dollars in thousands) January 1, 2022 December 26, 2020 $ Change % Change Interest expense $ 701 $ 946 $ (245 ) (25.9 %) Less: Interest income (193 ) (151 ) (42 ) 27.8 % Interest expense, net $ 508 $ 795 $ (287 ) (36.1 %) Average outstanding floor plan payable $ 32,942 $ 24,304 Average outstanding long-term debt $ 12,430 $ 64,663 Interest expense, net was $0.5 million for the three months ended January 1, 2022, a decrease of $0.3 million compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. The net decrease in expense was primarily due to lower average outstanding borrowings on long-term debt, offset in part by higher average borrowings on floor plan payables. The Company repaid the outstanding balance on its revolving credit facility during the second quarter of fiscal 2022. INCOME TAX EXPENSE The following table summarizes income tax expense for the three months ended January 1, 2022 and December 26, 2020: Three months ended (Dollars in thousands) January 1, 2022 December 26, 2020 $ Change % Change Income tax expense $ 23,277 $ 5,284 $ 17,993 340.5 % Effective tax rate 25.6 % 19.7 % Income tax expense for the three months ended January 1, 2022 was $23.3 million, representing an effective tax rate of 25.6%, compared to income tax expense of $5.3 million, representing an effective tax rate of 19.7% for the three months ended December 26, 2020.

The Company’s effective tax rate for the three months ended January 1, 2022 differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of 21.0% due primarily to the effect of state and local income taxes, non-deductible expenses, tax credits, results in foreign jurisdictions, and tax benefits related to equity compensation. The Company’s effective tax rate for the three months ended December 26, 2020 differed from the federal statutory income tax rate of 21.0% due primarily to the effect of non-deductible expenses, state and local income taxes, tax credits (including the R&D study), and results in foreign jurisdictions.

The increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of homes sold during the period of 4,046 and an increase in the average selling price of 26.4%. The increase in the number of homes sold was a result of increased production levels at many of the Company’s manufacturing locations in response to strong demand for our products, as well as the addition of production volume through the acquisition of ScotBilt. The average selling price increased over the prior year due to pricing actions enacted in response to rising material and labor costs. Generally, we are able to pass increases in input costs along to our customers. The improvement this year is also a result of a negative impact to sales in the prior fiscal year caused by COVID-19 related plant shutdowns and higher than normal absenteeism. Canadian Factory-built Housing: The Canadian Factory-built Housing segment net sales increased by $47.1 million, or 71.3%, for the nine months ended January 1, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year, primarily due to an increase in homes sold of 267 and a 29.0% increase in average home selling price. The increase in volume was due to an increase in production rates in response to strong housing demand. The increase in average selling price was due to pricing actions enacted in response to rising material and labor costs. In addition, on a constant currency basis, net sales for the Canadian segment were favorably impacted by approximately $8.4 million due to fluctuations in the translation of the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar during the first nine months of fiscal 2022 as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. Net sales during the nine months ended December 26, 2020 were negatively impacted by COVID-19 related plant shutdowns and higher than normal absenteeism. Corporate/Other: Net sales for Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation business and the elimination of intersegment sales. For the nine months ended January 1, 2022, net sales increased $4.0 million, or 10.3%, primarily attributable to an increase in shipments of manufactured homes and recreational vehicles.

Gross profit was 25.4% as a percent of segment net sales for the nine months ended January 1, 2022 compared to 19.1% in the same period of the prior fiscal year. The increase in gross profit is due to operational efficiencies and increased leverage of manufacturing fixed costs resulting from higher production volumes and higher average selling prices during fiscal 2022. Higher input costs for materials and labor have generally been offset to date by increasing the prices of our products. The improvement is also a result of less COVID-19 related sick-pay and health benefits which were provided in the prior fiscal year. Canadian Factory-built Housing: Gross profit for the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment increased by $14.5 million, or 112.1% during the nine months ended January 1, 2022 compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year primarily due to increased sales volumes and the price of our products. Gross profit as a percent of net sales was 24.2% for the nine months ended January 1, 2022, compared to 19.6% in the same period of the prior 22 fiscal year.

OTHER EXPENSE (INCOME) The following table summarizes other income for the nine months ended January 1, 2022 and December 26, 2020: Nine months ended (Dollars in thousands) January 1, 2022 December 26, 2020 $ Change % Change Other income $ (36 ) $ (6,993 ) $ 6,957 (99.5 %) Other income decreased $7.0 million, or 99.5%, during the nine months ended January 1, 2022, compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. The decrease is due to a reduction in the wage subsidies provided by government sponsored financial assistance programs that were enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic during fiscal 2021. The programs included a Canadian wage subsidy benefit of $6.2 million and U.S. federal and state wage subsidy benefits of $0.8 million recognized in the nine months ended December 26, 2020 which did not recur in the current year. INCOME TAX EXPENSE The following table summarizes income tax expense for the nine months ended January 1, 2022 and December 26, 2020: Nine months ended (Dollars in thousands) January 1, 2022 December 26, 2020 $ Change % Change Income tax expense $ 53,696 $ 15,493 $ 38,203 246.6 % Effective tax rate 25.0 % 23.3 % Income tax expense for the nine months ended January 1, 2022 was $53.7 million, representing an effective tax rate of 25.0%, compared to income tax expense of $15.5 million, representing an effective tax rate of 23.3% for the nine months ended December 26, 2020. The change in the effective tax rate for the nine months ended January 1, 2022 compared with the same period of the prior year, was primarily due to the recognition of a tax benefit of $1.7 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2021 related to a U.S. R&D tax credit study. The Company’s effective tax rate for the nine months ended January 1, 2022 differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of 21.0% due primarily to the effect of state and local income taxes, non-deductible expenses, tax credits, results in foreign jurisdictions, and tax benefits related to equity compensation. The Company’s effective tax rate for the nine months ended December 26, 2020 differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of 21.0% due primarily to the effect of non-deductible expenses, state and local income taxes, tax credits (including the R&D study), and results in foreign jurisdictions. 24 ADJUSTED EBITDA The following table reconciles net income, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, to Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the nine months ended January 1, 2022 and December 26, 2020: Nine months ended (Dollars in thousands) January 1, 2022 December 26, 2020 $ Change % Change Net income $ 161,246 $ 51,013 $ 110,233 216.1 % Income tax expense 53,696 15,493 38,203 246.6 % Interest expense, net 2,002 2,601 (599 ) (23.0 %) Depreciation and amortization 15,533 13,076 2,457 18.8 % Equity-based compensation (for awards granted prior to December 31, 2018) — 1,358 (1,358 ) (100.0 %) Adjusted EBITDA $ 232,477 $ 83,541 $ 148,936 178.3 % Adjusted EBITDA for the nine months ended January 1, 2022 was $232.5 million, an increase of $148.9 million, from the same period of the prior fiscal year. The increase is primarily a result of higher operating income due to increases in net sales volume and gross margins, partially offset by higher SG&A expenses and the reduction in wage subsidies received in the prior year. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss plus; (a) the provision for income taxes; (b) interest expense, net; (c) depreciation and amortization; (d) gain or loss from discontinued operations; (e) equity based compensation for awards granted prior to December 31, 2018; (f) non-cash restructuring charges and impairment of assets; and (g) other non-operating costs including those for the acquisition and integration or disposition of businesses and idle facilities. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of earnings calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income or loss prepared on a U.S. GAAP basis. Adjusted EBITDA does not purport to represent cash flow provided by, or used in, operating activities as defined by U.S. GAAP, which is presented in the Statement of Cash Flows. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, investors should be aware that, in the future, the Company may incur expenses similar to those adjusted for in this presentation. This presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an implication that the Company’s future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items. Adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are: Adjusted EBITDA: Also about Adjusted EBITDA: Given these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our U.S. GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures only on a supplemental basis. 25 BACKLOG Although orders from customers can be cancelled at any time without penalty, and unfilled orders are not necessarily an indication of future business, the Company’s unfilled U.S. and Canadian manufacturing orders at January 1, 2022 totaled $1.5 billion compared to $488.5 million at December 26, 2020. The increase in backlog was driven by increased demand for single-family homes, which resulted in order levels that significantly outpaced production in both the U.S. and Canada. Our ability to increase production rates to keep pace with orders is limited by individual plant capacity, the availability of and tim e needed to train new employees, employee attendance and availability of materials, including certain allocations of raw materials by our suppliers. W e may experience greater order cancellations in the future as a result of higher prices and the longer time required to manufacture and deliver our products. Liquidity and Capital Resources Sources and Uses of Cash The following table presents summary cash flow information for the nine months ended January 1, 2022 and December 26, 2020: Nine months ended (Dollars in thousands) January 1, 2022 December 26, 2020 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 164,406 $ 103,816 Investing activities (22,921 ) (1,213 ) Financing activities (21,355 ) (47,938 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents (578 ) 2,940 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents 119,552 57,605 Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period 262,581 209,455 Cash and cash equivalents at end of period $ 382,133 $ 267,060 The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and existing cash balances. Cash balances and cash flows from operations for the next year are expected to be adequate to cover working capital requirements and capital expenditures. The Company does not have any scheduled long-term debt maturities in the next twelve months. On July 7, 2021, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement which provides for a $200.0 million revolving credit facility, including a $45.0 million letter of credit sub-facility. At January 1, 2022, $169.6 million was available for borrowing under the Amended Credit Agreement. The Company’s revolving credit facility includes (i) a maximum consolidated total net leverage ratio of 3.25 to 1.00, subject to an upward adjustment upon the consummation of a material acquisition, and (ii) a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.00 to 1.00. The Company anticipates compliance with its debt covenants and projects its level of cash availability to be in excess of cash needed to operate the business for the next year. In the event operating cash flow and existing cash balances were deemed inadequate to support the Company’s liquidity needs, and one or more capital resources were to become unavailable, the Company would revise operating strategies accordingly. Cash provided by operating activities was $164.4 million for the nine months ended January 1, 2022 compared to $103.8 million for the nine months ended December 26, 2020. Cash provided by operating activities increased due to higher net income in the current year, partially offset by an increase in inventory from higher material costs and higher stocking levels to mitigate supply chain challenges, an increase in prepaid and other assets primarily from the capitalization of $15.4 million of cloud computing costs in fiscal 2022, and a $5.9 million payment of payroll taxes which were deferred in the prior fiscal year under the CARES Act regulations. Cash used in investing activities was $22.9 million for the nine months ended January 1, 2022 compared to $1.2 million for the nine months ended December 26, 2020. The increase was primarily related to an increase in capital expenditures in the current period. The Company acquired two idle manufacturing facilities in Texas and made investments in plant improvements to facilitate increased production or operational efficiencies. The Company deferred all non-essential spending in the first half of fiscal 2021 due to COVID-19 concerns. Cash used in financing activities was $21.4 million for the nine months ended January 1, 2022 compared to $47.9 million for the nine months ended December 26, 2020. The decrease in cash used for financing was primarily related to lower repayments during fiscal 2022 of the Company's previously existing revolving credit facility. The Company also saw an increase in floor plan financing during fiscal 2022, which had decreased in fiscal 2021 in response to lowering financed retail inventories in response to the pandemic.

Basis of Presentation and Business Nature of Operations: Skyline Champion Corporation (the “Company”) is a leading producer of factory-built housing in the United States (“U.S.”) and Canada. The Company’s operations consist of manufacturing, retail, and transportation activities. The Company operates 35 manufacturing facilities throughout the U.S. and five manufacturing facilities in western Canada. These facilities primarily construct factory-built, timber-framed manufactured, and modular houses that are sold primarily to independent retailers, builders/developers, and manufactured home community operators. The Company’s retail operations consist of 18 sales centers that sell manufactured houses to consumers primarily in the Southern U.S. The Company’s transportation business engages independent owners/drivers to transport manufactured homes, recreational vehicles and other products throughout the U.S. and Canada. COVID-19 Government Financial Assistance: The outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (""COVID-19"") was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. Various government programs were announced to provide financial relief for affected businesses, including the Employee Retention Credit under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (""CARES Act"") and state level programs in the United States and the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (""CEWS"") under the COVID-19 Economic Response Plan in Canada. The Company recognized $ 0.6 million for wage subsidies under the CARES Act and other state level programs in the United States during the first quarter of fiscal 2021. The Company recognized $ 2.6 million and $ 6.2 million of payroll subsidies under CEWS during the three and six months ended September 26, 2020, respectively. The Company’s policy is to account for these subsidies as Other Income in the period in which the related costs are incurred and the Company is reasonably assured to receive payment. In addition, the CARES Act allows for deferring payment of certain payroll taxes. Through October 2, 2021 , the Company has deferred $ 11.8 million of payroll taxes that will be paid beginning in December 2021. Basis of Presentation: The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) for Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Article 10 of SEC Regulation S-X. Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“U.S. GAAP”) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany balances and transactions. In the opinion of management, these statements include all normal recurring adjustments necessary to fairly state the Company’s consolidated results of operations, cash flows, and financial position. The Company has evaluated subsequent events after the balance sheet date through the date of the filing of this report with the SEC. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the SEC on May 26, 2021 (the “Fiscal 2021 Annual Report”). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The condensed consolidated income statements, condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income, and condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations or cash flows for the full year. The Company’s allowance for credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost reflects management’s estimate of credit losses over the remaining expected life of such assets, measured primarily using historical experience, as well as current economic conditions and forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. Expected credit losses for newly recognized financial assets, as well as changes to expected credit losses during the period, are recognized in earnings. Accounts receivable are reflected net of reserves of $ 0.5 million and $ 0.4 million at October 2, 2021 and April 3, 2021, respectively. At both October 2, 2021 and April 3, 2021, other notes receivable are reflected net of reserves of $ 0.4 million. The Company’s fiscal year is a 52- or 53-week period that ends on the Saturday nearest to March 31. The Company’s current fiscal year, “fiscal 2022,” will end on April 2, 2022 and will include 52 weeks. References to “fiscal 2021” refer to the Company’s fiscal year ended April 3, 2021. The three and six months ended October 2, 2021 and September 26, 2020 each included 13 and 26 weeks, respectively. There were no accounting standards recently issued that are expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations. 6 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued 2. Business Acquisition ScotBilt Acquisition On February 28, 2021 , the Company acquired 100 % of the membership interests of ScotBilt Homes, LLC and related companies (“ScotBilt”), a builder of manufactured homes with annual revenues of approximately $ 79.0 million, for a purchase price of $ 53.0 million. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, the preliminary purchase price was adjusted for cash held by ScotBilt at the closing date and working capital adjustments resulting in an initial total purchase consideration of $ 54.5 million. In the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company adjusted the preliminary purchase price allocation by $ 0.2 million as a result of the final working capital settlement. The Company accounted for the acquisition as a business combination under the acquisition method of accounting provided by FASB ASC 805, Business Combinations (“ASC 805”). As such, the purchase price was allocated to the net assets acquired, inclusive of intangible assets, with the excess fair value recorded to goodwill. The purchase price allocation for this acquisition is preliminary and could change. The preliminary allocation of the purchase price was as follows: (Dollars in thousands) Cash $ 1,521 Trade accounts receivable 2,256 Inventory 6,752 Property, plant, and equipment 10,466 Other assets 1,164 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities ( 7,432 ) Intangibles 21,100 Goodwill 18,449 Total purchase price allocation $ 54,276 Goodwill is primarily attributable to expected synergies from the combination of the companies, including, but not limited to, expected cost synergies through procurement activities and operational improvements through sharing of best practices. Goodwill, which is deductible for income tax purposes, was allocated to the U.S. Factory-built Housing reporting unit. Cash, trade accounts receivable, inventory, other assets, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities were generally stated at historical carrying values given the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities. Intangible assets include $ 13.0 million in customer relationships and $ 8.1 million associated with the ScotBilt trade name and were based on an independent appraisal. The fair value of the customer relationships was determined using the multi-period excess earnings method and the fair value of the trade name was determined using the relief-from-royalty method. The Company estimates that each intangible asset has a weighted average useful life of ten years from the acquisition date. Fair value estimates of property, plant, and equipment were based on independent appraisals, giving consideration to the highest and best use of the assets. Key assumptions used in the appraisals were based on a combination of market, cost, and sales comparison approaches, as appropriate. Level 3 fair value estimates of $ 10.5 million related to property, plant, and equipment and $ 21.1 million related to intangible assets were recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of April 3, 2021. The acquisition of ScotBilt was a taxable business combination. Therefore, the Company’s tax basis in the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed approximate the respective fair values at the acquisition date. 3. Inventories, net The components of inventory, net of reserves for obsolete inventory, were as follows: (Dollars in thousands) October 2, 2021 April 3, 2021 Raw materials $ 104,179 $ 91,916 Work in process 24,036 21,642 Finished goods and other 51,761 52,555 Total inventories, net $ 179,976 $ 166,113 At October 2, 2021 and April 3, 2021, reserves for obsolete inventory were $ 4.5 million and $ 4.6 million, respectively . 7 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued 4. Property, Plant, and Equipment Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated primarily on a straight-line basis, generally over the following estimated useful lives: land improvements – 3 to 10 years; buildings and improvements – 8 to 25 years ; and vehicles and machinery and equipment – 3 to 8 years . Depreciation expense for the three months ended October 2, 2021 and September 26, 2020 was $ 3.3 million and $ 3.1 million, respectively. Depreciation expense for the six months ended October 2, 2021 and September 26, 2020 was $ 6.5 million and $ 6.0 million, respectively. The components of property, plant, and equipment were as follows: (Dollars in thousands) October 2, 2021 April 3, 2021 Land and improvements $ 38,966 $ 36,470 Buildings and improvements 96,324 97,005 Machinery and equipment 61,384 57,790 Construction in progress 10,591 1,889 Property, plant, and equipment, at cost 207,265 193,154 Less: accumulated depreciation ( 84,360 ) ( 78,014 ) Property, plant, and equipment, net $ 122,905 $ 115,140 5. Goodwill, Intangible Assets, and Cloud Computing Arrangements Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. At October 2, 2021 and April 3, 2021 , the Company had goodwill of $ 192.0 million and $ 191.8 million, respectively. Intangible Assets The components of amortizable intangible assets were as follows: (Dollars in thousands) October 2, 2021 April 3, 2021 Customer Relationships Trade Names Total Customer Relationships Trade Names Total Gross carrying amount $ 61,923 $ 21,393 $ 83,316 $ 61,963 $ 21,409 $ 83,372 Accumulated amortization ( 20,934 ) ( 7,309 ) ( 28,243 ) ( 18,158 ) ( 6,379 ) $ ( 24,537 ) Amortizable intangibles, net $ 40,989 $ 14,084 $ 55,073 $ 43,805 $ 15,030 $ 58,835 During the three months ended October 2, 2021 and September 26, 2020, amortization of intangible assets wa s $ 1.9 million and $ 1.3 million, respectively. During the six months ended October 2, 2021 and September 26, 2020, amortization of intangible assets was $ 3.8 million and $ 2.7 million, respectively. Cloud Computing Arrangements The Company capitalizes costs associated with the development of cloud computing arrangements in a manner consistent with internally developed technology. At October 2, 2021 and April 3, 2021, the Company had capitalized cloud computing costs of $ 10.6 million and $ 0.3 million within other noncurrent assets, respectively. There was no amortization of capitalized cloud computing costs during the three and six months ended October 2, 2021 and September 26, 2020, respectively, as the related cloud computing technology has not yet been placed in service. 8 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued 6.

The Amended Credit Agreement replaced the Company’s previously existing $ 100.0 million revolving credit facility. Outstanding borrowings of $ 26.9 million on the Company’s previous revolving credit facility were repaid in July 2021. The Amended Credit Agreement allows the Company to draw down, repay and re-draw loans on the available funds during the term, subject to certain terms and conditions, matures in July 2026 and has no scheduled amortization. The Company capitalized $ 1.1 million of deferred financing fees associated with the Amended Credit Agreement, which is included in other noncurrent assets on the consolidated balance sheet. The Company wrote off $ 0.3 million of deferred financing fees associated with the previously existing credit facility, which is included in interest expense, net for the three and six months ended October 2, 2021. The interest rate on borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement adjusts based on the consolidated total net leverage of the Company from a high of LIBOR plus 1.875 % and ABR plus 0.875 %, at the election of the Company, when the consolidated total net leverage ratio is equal to or greater than 2.25 :1.00, to a low of LIBOR plus 1.125 % and ABR plus 0.125 % when the consolidated total net leverage is below 0.50:1.00. In addition, the Company is obligated to pay an unused line fee ranging between 0.15 % and 0.3 % (depending on the consolidated total net leverage ratio) in respect of unused commitments under the Amended Credit Agreement. At October 2, 2021 the interest rate under the Amended Credit Agreement was 1.2 % . At October 2, 2021, letters of credit issued under the Amended Credit Agreement totaled $ 30.4 million and total available borrowings were $ 169.6 million. 9 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued Obligations under industrial revenue bonds are supported by letters of credit and bear interest based on a municipal bond index rate. The weighted-average interest rate at October 2, 2021 , including related costs and fees, was 1.74 %. The industrial revenue bonds require lump-sum payments of principal upon maturity in 2029 . The Amended Credit Agreement contains covenants that restrict the amount of additional debt, liens and certain payments, including equity buybacks, investments, dispositions, mergers and consolidations, among other restrictions as defined. The Company was in compliance with all covenants of the Amended Credit Agreement as of October 2, 2021. Floor Plan Payable The Company’s retail operations utilize floor plan financing to fund the purchase of manufactured homes for display or resale. At October 2, 2021 and April 3, 2021, the Company had outstanding borrowings on floor plan financing agreements of $ 30.8 million and $ 25.7 million, respectively. Total credit line capacity provided under the agreements was $ 57.0 million as of October 2, 2021 . Borrowings are secured by the homes and are required to be repaid when the Company sells the home to a customer. 10 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued 9.

Income Taxes For the three months ended October 2, 2021 and September 26, 2020 , the Company recorded $ 16.4 million and $ 5.6 million of income tax expense and had an effective tax rate during each period of 24.4 %. For the six months ended October 2, 2021 and September 26, 2020 , the Company recorded $ 30.4 million and $ 10.2 million of income tax expense and had an effective tax rate of 24.5 % and 25.8 %, respectively. The Company’s effective tax rate for the three months and six months ended October 2, 2021 differs from the federal statutory rate of 21.0 % due primarily to the effect of state and local income taxes, non-deductible expenses, tax credits, results in foreign jurisdictions, and tax benefits from vested equity compensation. The Company’s effective tax rate for the three months and six months ended September 26, 2020 differs from the federal statutory rate of 21.0 % due primarily to the effect of state and local income taxes, non-deductible expenses, tax credits, and results in foreign jurisdictions. At October 2, 2021 , the Company had no unrecognized tax benefits. The Company does not anticipate any material changes to uncertain tax benefits in the next twelve months. The Company records interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. 11. Earnings Per Share Basic net income per share (“EPS”) attributable to the Company was computed by dividing net income attributable to the Company by the average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Certain of the Company’s time-based restricted share awards were considered participating securities prior to the completion of the vesting period. The vesting for these time-based shares occurred in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. Diluted earnings per common share is computed based on the more dilutive of: (i) the two class method, assuming the participating securities are not exercised or converted; or (ii) the summation of average common shares outstanding and additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential common shares had been issued. During the three and six months ended September 26, 2020, the two-class method was more dilutive. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share: Three months ended Six months ended (Dollars and shares in thousands, except per share data) October 2, 2021 September 26, 2020 October 2, 2021 September 26, 2020 Numerator: Net income $ 50,723 $ 17,511 $ 93,624 $ 29,414 Undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities — ( 19 ) — ( 53 ) Net income attributable to the Company's common shareholders $ 50,723 $ 17,492 $ 93,624 $ 29,361 Denominator: Basic weighted-average shares outstanding 56,808 56,654 56,757 56,593 Dilutive securities 400 255 455 238 Diluted weighted-average shares outstanding 57,208 56,909 57,212 56,831 Basic net income per share $ 0.89 $ 0.31 $ 1.65 $ 0.52 Diluted net income per share $ 0.89 $ 0.31 $ 1.64 $ 0.52 12 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued 12. Segment Information Financial results for the Company's reportable segments have been prepared using a management approach, which is consistent with the basis and manner in which financial information is evaluated by the Company's chief operating decision maker in allocating resources and in assessing performance. The Company’s chief operating decision maker, the Chief Executive Officer, evaluates the performance of the Company’s segments primarily based on net sales, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (“EBITDA”) and operating assets. The Company operates in two reportable segments: (i) U.S. Factory-built Housing, which includes manufacturing and retail housing operations and (ii) Canadian Factory-built Housing. Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation operations, corporate costs incurred for all segments and intersegment eliminations. Segments are generally determined by geography. Segment data includes intersegment revenues and corporate office costs that are directly and exclusively incurred for each segment. Total assets for Corporate/Other primarily includes cash and certain deferred tax items not specifically allocated to another segment. Selected financial information by reportable segment was as follows: Three months ended Six months ended (Dollars in thousands) October 2, 2021 September 26, 2020 October 2, 2021 September 26, 2020 Net sales: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 471,699 $ 283,360 $ 929,019 $ 532,219 Canadian Factory-built Housing 38,501 24,558 76,332 39,753 Corporate/Other 14,025 14,448 29,071 23,679 Consolidated net sales $ 524,225 $ 322,366 $ 1,034,422 $ 595,651 Operating income: U.S. Factory-built Housing EBITDA $ 78,075 $ 28,697 $ 141,092 $ 53,090 Canadian Factory-built Housing EBITDA 6,390 5,951 12,056 10,857 Corporate/Other EBITDA ( 11,351 ) ( 6,221 ) ( 17,328 ) ( 13,828 ) Other income 11 ( 2,599 ) ( 43 ) ( 6,813 ) Depreciation ( 3,264 ) ( 3,048 ) ( 6,521 ) ( 5,969 ) Amortization ( 1,874 ) ( 1,360 ) ( 3,762 ) ( 2,721 ) Consolidated operating income $ 67,987 $ 21,420 $ 125,494 $ 34,616 Depreciation: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 2,619 $ 2,391 $ 5,229 $ 4,789 Canadian Factory-built Housing 273 248 558 363 Corporate/Other 372 409 734 817 Consolidated depreciation $ 3,264 $ 3,048 $ 6,521 $ 5,969 Amortization of U.S. Factory-built Housing intangible assets: $ 1,874 $ 1,360 $ 3,762 $ 2,721 Capital expenditures: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 5,269 $ 1,054 $ 12,527 $ 1,939 Canadian Factory-built Housing 236 85 341 242 Corporate/Other 379 102 2,237 371 Consolidated capital expenditures $ 5,884 $ 1,241 $ 15,105 $ 2,552 (Dollars in thousands) October 2, 2021 April 3, 2021 Total Assets: U.S. Factory-built Housing (1) $ 605,669 $ 578,897 Canadian Factory-built Housing (1) 93,773 87,224 Corporate/Other (1) 310,888 251,781 Consolidated total assets $ 1,010,330 $ 917,902 13 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued 13. Commitments, Contingencies and Legal Proceedings Repurchase Contingencies and Guarantees The Company is contingently liable under terms of repurchase agreements with lending institutions that provide wholesale floor plan financing to retailers. These arrangements, which are customary in the manufactured housing industry, provide for the repurchase of products sold to retailers in the event of default by the retailer on its agreement to pay the financial institution. The risk of loss from these agreements is spread over numerous retailers. The repurchase price is generally determined by the original sales price of the product less contractually defined curtailment payments. Excluding the resale value of the homes, the contingent repurchase obligation as of October 2, 2021 was estimated to be $ 243.4 million . The Company accounts for the guarantees under its repurchase agreements with the retailers’ financing institutions by estimating and deferring a portion of the related product sale that represents the estimated fair value of the repurchase obligation. In addition, the Company has estimated the expected contingent net loss the Company will incur upon resale of any repurchases. These estimates are based on recent historical experience supplemented by management’s assessment of current economic and other conditions affecting retailers for which the Company has a contingent repurchase obligation. Based on these repurchase agreements and historical loss experience, as well as current economic conditions and forecasts that affect the potential loss exposure, a loss reserve of $ 1.5 million and $ 1.4 million was recorded as of October 2, 2021 and April 3, 2021, respectively. Losses incurred on homes repurchased were not significant during the three or six months ended October 2, 2021 or September 26, 2020. At October 2, 2021, the Company was contingently obligated for $ 30.4 million under letters of credit, prima rily consisting of $ 12.6 million to support long-term debt, $ 17.5 million to support the casualty insurance program, and $ 0.3 million to su pport bonding agreements. The letters of credit are issued from a sub-facility of the Amended Credit Agreement. The Company was also contingently obligated for $ 35.1 million under surety bonds, generally to support performance on long-term construction contracts and license and service bonding requirements. In the normal course of business, the Company’s former subsidiaries that operated in the United Kingdom historically provided certain guarantees to two customers. Those guarantees provide contractual liability for proven construction defects up to 12 years from the date of delivery of certain products. The guarantees remain a contingent liability of the Company which declines over time through October 2027. As of the date of this report, the Company expects few, if any, claims to be reported under the terms of the guarantees. Legal Proceedings The Company has agreed to indemnify counterparties in the ordinary course of its business in agreements to acquire and sell business assets and in financing arrangements. The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of its business. As of the date of this filing, the Company believes the ultimate liability with respect to these contingent obligations will not have, either individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 14 Item 2. MANAGEMENT’ S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following should be read in conjunction with Skyline Champion Corporation’s condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear in Item 1 of this Report. Overview Skyline Champion Corporation (the “Company”) is a leading producer of factory-built housing in the U.S. and Canada. The Company serves as a complete solutions provider across complementary and vertically integrated businesses including manufactured offsite construction, company-owned retail locations, and transportation logistics services. The Company is the largest independent publicly traded factory-built solutions provider in North America (based on revenue) and markets its homes under several nationally recognized brand names including Skyline Homes, Champion Home Builders, Genesis Homes, Athens Park Models, Dutch Housing, Excel Homes, Homes of Merit, New Era, Redman Homes, ScotBilt Homes, Shore Park, Silvercrest, and Titan Homes in the U.S., and Moduline and SRI Homes in western Canada. The Company operates 35 manufacturing facilities throughout the U.S. and five manufacturing facilities in western Canada that primarily construct factory-built, timber-framed, manufactured and modular houses that are sold mainly to independent retailers, builders/developers, and manufactured home community operators. The Company’s retail operations consist of 18 sales centers that sell manufactured homes to consumers primarily in the southern U.S. The Company’s transportation business engages independent owners/drivers to transport manufactured homes, recreational vehicles, and other products throughout the U.S. and Canada. Industry and Company Outlook Since July 2020, U.S. and Canadian housing industry demand has been robust. The limited availability of existing homes for sale and the broader need for newly built affordable, single-family housing has continued to drive demand for new homes in these markets. In recent years, manufactured home construction experienced revenue growth due to a number of favorable demographic trends and demand drivers in the United States, including underlying growth trends in key homebuyer groups, such as the population over 55 years of age, the population of first-time home buyers, and the population of households earning less than $60,000 per year. We have also seen a number of market trends pointing to increased sales of accessory dwelling units and urban-to-rural migration as customers accommodate working-from-home patterns, as well as people seeking rent-to-own single-family options. The robust demand environment has resulted in backlog of $1,369 million as of October 2, 2021 compared to $390.1 million as of September 26, 2020. Generally higher backlog at our manufacturing facilities creates an opportunity to increase production efficiencies. Although the higher demand brings opportunities, it also has resulted in significant increases in certain material input costs, most significantly forest products for much of fiscal 2022. In addition, we are also experiencing supply disruption, higher freight costs and fluctuating prices for many of our other material inputs. Finding and retaining qualified labor continues to be a challenge for our plants which requires us to review our compensation programs and adjust accordingly. We manage our business to anticipate or quickly react to these supply challenges and cost increases and generally are able to pass along increased costs to our customers. Historically, order cancellation rates have been very low, but the longer lead-time caused by larger backlogs and changing prices could result in cancellations in future periods. For the six months ended October 2, 2021, approximately 77% of the Company’s U.S. manufacturing sales were generated from the manufacture of homes that comply with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (""HUD"") code construction standard in the U.S. Industry shipments of HUD-code homes are reported on a one-month lag. According to data reported by the Manufactured Housing Institute ("" MHI""), HUD-code industry home shipments were 43,949 and 36,312 units during the five months ended August 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Based on industry data, the Company’s U.S. wholesale market share of HUD code homes sold was 19.5% and 15.6%, for the five months ended August 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Annual shipments have generally increased each year since calendar year 2009 when only 50,000 HUD-coded manufactured homes were shipped, the lowest level since the industry began recording statistics in 1959. While shipments of HUD-coded manufactured homes have improved modestly in recent years, manufactured housing’s most recent annual shipment levels still operate at lower levels than the long-term historical average of over 200,000 units. Acquisitions and Expansions Over the last several years, demand for the Company’s products, primarily affordable housing in the U.S., has continued to improve. As a result, the Company has focused on operational improvements to make existing manufacturing facilities more profitable as well as executing measured expansion of its manufacturing and retail footprints. The Company has increased capacity through strategic acquisitions and expansions of its manufacturing operations. The Company is focused on growing in strong housing markets across the U.S. On June 21, 2021, the Company acquired two idle facilities in Navasota, Texas in order to strengthen its production capabilities in the Texas market. The Company intends to initiate production in one of these facilities by the end of fiscal 2022. On February 28, 2021, the Company acquired ScotBilt. In calendar 2020, ScotBilt shipped over 1,600 homes from its two manufacturing facilities in Georgia providing affordable housing throughout Alabama, Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas. ScotBilt has approximately 400 employees in its two 15 manufacturing facilities. The Company believes ScotBilt is an excellent fit because of the compatible company cultures and because of ScotBilt’s strong presence in the attractive Mid-South region, which helps to balance national distribution and complements the Company’s existing manufacturing footprint. The operations of ScotBilt are included in the financial results of the Company since the date of the acquisition. On January 14, 2021, the Company acquired two idled facilities in Pembroke, North Carolina, which provides an opportunity to further expand its manufacturing footprint in the South and Southeast markets. The Company is currently assessing prospects for initiating production in one or both of these facilities. The Company's acquisitions and investments are part of a strategy to grow and diversify revenue with a focus on increasing the Company’s HUD and modular homebuilding presence in the U.S. as well as improving the results of operations. These acquisitions and investments are included in the Company's consolidated results for periods subsequent to their respective acquisition dates. COVID-19 Pandemic The outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (""COVID-19"") was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. There remains continued uncertainty regarding the extent and duration of the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on the economy, the housing market, and the Company, as well as the Company’s employees, customers, and suppliers. The Company has prioritized the safety and well-being of its employees and customers and has implemented standards to operate in accordance with social-distancing protocols and public health authority guidelines. Beginning in March 2020, the Company took actions to temporarily idle certain facilities in response to government shutdown orders or reduced demand. By late April 2020, most of the temporarily idled manufacturing facilities had reopened, but at reduced production levels due to employee absenteeism, difficulty hiring new team members, and social distancing protocols. During fiscal 2021, the Company experienced intermittent closures due to COVID-19 outbreaks at the facilities or surrounding communities causing higher than normal absenteeism. In the second half of fiscal 2021, the Company was able to increase daily production rates over the levels achieved in the prior fiscal year period as direct labor staffing levels increased and production efficiencies improved. As of October 2, 2021, availability of labor and certain materials remain subject to disruption and uncertainty. Prices for key raw materials have experienced increased volatility and, overall, manufacturing costs have trended higher than prior periods. As part of the initial response to the pandemic, the Company offered extended benefits to employees, including increased sick pay and waived premium payments on healthcare benefits for furloughed employees during the first quarter of fiscal 2021. The Company’s U.S. operations incurred $1.9 million of expense related to the extended benefits. Various government programs have been announced to provide financial relief for affected businesses, including the Employee Retention Credit under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (""CARES Act"") in the United States and the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (""CEWS"") under the COVID-19 Economic Response Plan in Canada. CEWS provided a cash subsidy of up to 75% of eligible employees’ remuneration, subject to certain criteria. The Company recognized $2.6 million and $6.2 million, respectively, for payroll subsidies under CEWS during the three and six months ended September 26, 2020. The Company also recognized $0.6 million for payroll subsidies under the CARES Act during the first quarter of fiscal 2021. In addition, the CARES Act allowed for deferring payment of certain payroll taxes. Through October 2, 2021, the Company has deferred $11.8 million of payroll taxes that will be paid beginning in December 2021. 16 UNAUDITED INCOME STATEMENTS FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2022 VS. 2021 Three months ended (Dollars in thousands) October 2, 2021 September 26, 2020 Results of Operations Data: Net sales $ 524,225 $ 322,366 Cost of sales 394,898 259,573 Gross profit 129,327 62,793 Selling, general, and administrative expenses 61,340 41,373 Operating income 67,987 21,420 Interest expense, net 845 864 Other income (expense) 11 (2,599 ) Income before income taxes 67,131 23,155 Income tax expense 16,408 5,644 Net income $ 50,723 $ 17,511 Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA: Net income $ 50,723 $ 17,511 Income tax expense 16,408 5,644 Interest expense, net 845 864 Depreciation and amortization 5,138 4,408 Equity-based compensation (for awards granted prior to December 31, 2018) — 388 Other — 122 Adjusted EBITDA $ 73,114 $ 28,937 As a percent of net sales: Gross profit 24.7 % 19.5 % Selling, general, and administrative expenses 11.7 % 12.8 % Operating income 13.0 % 6.6 % Net income 9.7 % 5.4 % Adjusted EBITDA 13.9 % 9.0 % NET SALES The following table summarizes net sales for the three months ended October 2, 2021 and September 26, 2020: Three months ended (Dollars in thousands) October 2, 2021 September 26, 2020 $ Change % Change Net sales $ 524,225 $ 322,366 $ 201,859 62.6 % U.S. manufacturing and retail net sales $ 471,699 $ 283,360 $ 188,339 66.5 % U.S. homes sold 5,902 4,689 1,213 25.9 % U.S. manufacturing and retail average home selling price $ 79.9 $ 60.4 $ 19.5 32.3 % Canadian manufacturing net sales $ 38,501 $ 24,558 $ 13,943 56.8 % Canadian homes sold 358 302 56 18.5 % Canadian manufacturing average home selling price $ 107.5 $ 81.3 $ 26.2 32.2 % Corporate/Other net sales $ 14,025 $ 14,448 $ (423 ) (2.9 %) U.S. manufacturing facilities in operation at end of period 35 33 U.S. retail sales centers in operation at end of period 18 18 Canadian manufacturing facilities in operation at end of period 5 5 Net sales for the three months ended October 2, 2021 were $524.2 million, an increase of $201.9 million, or 62.6%, over the three months ended September 26, 2020.

The change was primarily due to an increase in the number of homes sold during the period of 25.9%, an increase in the average home selling price of 32.3%, and the impact of the acquisition of ScotBilt. Demand for our products has increased significantly in recent periods and we have been able to increase production in response to that demand. The average selling price increased during the period due to pricing actions enacted in response to rising material, freight, and labor costs. Generally, we are able to pass the increase in input costs along to our customers. Canadian Factory-built Housing: The Canadian Factory-built Housing segment net sales increased by $13.9 million, or 56.8% for the three months ended October 2, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year, primarily due to an 18.5% increase in the number of homes sold and a 32.2% increase in average home selling price. The increase in volume was due to an increase in demand and production rates. The increase in average selling price was due to pricing actions enacted in response to rising material and labor costs. On a constant currency basis, net sales for the Canadian segment were unfavorably impacted by approximately $0.6 million due to fluctuations in the translation of the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar during the three months ended October 2, 2021 as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. Corporate/Other: Net sales for Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation business and the elimination of intersegment sales. For the three months ended October 2, 2021, net sales decreased $0.4 million, or 2.9%, primarily attributable to lower revenue from the shipment of recreational vehicles. GROSS PROFIT The following table summarizes gross profit for the three months ended October 2, 2021 and September 26, 2020: Three months ended (Dollars in thousands) October 2, 2021 September 26, 2020 $ Change % Change Gross profit: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 116,604 $ 54,546 $ 62,058 113.8 % Canadian Factory-built Housing 8,868 4,787 4,081 85.3 % Corporate/Other 3,855 3,460 395 11.4 % Total gross profit $ 129,327 $ 62,793 $ 66,534 106.0 % Gross profit as a percent of net sales 24.7 % 19.5 % Gross profit as a percent of sales during the three months ended October 2, 2021 was 24.7% compared to 19.5% during the three months ended September 26, 2020.

Gross profit was 24.7% as a percent of segment net sales for the three months ended October 2, 2021, compared to 19.2% in the same period of the prior fiscal year. The increase in gross profit is due to the increase in homes sold and operational efficiencies and increased leverage of manufacturing fixed costs resulting from higher production volumes. Canadian Factory-built Housing: Gross profit for the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment increased by $4.1 million, or 85.3%, during the three months ended October 2, 2021, compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year, primarily due to increased sales volume. Gross profit as a percent of net sales was 23.0% for the three months ended October 2, 2021, compared to 19.5% in the same period of the prior fiscal year. The improvement is due to direct labor and manufacturing efficiencies from the increase in home sales, partially offset by higher material costs. 18 Corporate/Other: Gross profit for the Corporate/Other segment increased $0.4 million, or 11.4%, during the three months ended October 2, 2021, compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, as a result of changes in revenue mix.

Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percent of segment net sales decreased to 9.1% for the three months ended October 2, 2021, compared to 10.4% during the comparable period of the prior fiscal year, primarily due to increased leverage of fixed costs resulting from the increase in sales. The increase in expenses resulted from the following factors: (i) higher sales commissions and incentive compensation, which is generally based on sales volume or a measure of profitability; (ii) higher wage expense from headcount increases due to the growth in housing demand; and (iii) the impact of the acquisition of the ScotBilt operations. Canadian Factory-built Housing: Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment increased $1.1 million, or 63.5%, for the three months ended October 2, 2021 when compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year.

Corporate/Other: Selling, general, and administrative expenses for Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation operations, corporate costs incurred for all segments, and intersegment eliminations. Selling, general, and administrative expenses for Corporate/Other increased $5.5 million, or 54.4%, during the three months ended October 2, 2021, compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, due to an increase in employee compensation, primarily equity and incentive compensation as well as $2.1 million of costs related to investments made to enhance our customer buying experience and supporting systems. 19 INTEREST EXPENSE, NET The following table summarizes the components of interest expense, net for the three months ended October 2, 2021 and September 26, 2020: Three months ended (Dollars in thousands) October 2, 2021 September 26, 2020 $ Change % Change Interest expense $ 993 $ 974 $ 19 2.0 % Less: Interest income (148 ) (110 ) (38 ) 34.5 % Interest expense, net $ 845 $ 864 $ (19 ) (2.2 %) Average outstanding floor plan payable $ 29,300 $ 27,309 Average outstanding long-term debt $ 12,430 $ 77,330 Interest expense, net was $0.8 million for the three months ended October 2, 2021, remaining consistent with the same period of the prior fiscal year. The Company wrote off $0.3 million of deferred financing fees during the second quarter ended October 2, 2021, which offset the reduction in interest expense from lower average outstanding borrowing balance on the Company's revolving credit facility during the second quarter ended October 2, 2021 versus the same quarter in fiscal 2021.

The increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of homes sold during the period of 3,557, an increase in the average selling price of 23.9%, and the impact of the acquisition of ScotBilt. The increase in the number of homes sold was a result of increased production levels at many of the Company’s manufacturing locations in reaction to strong demand. The average selling price increased due to pricing actions enacted in response to rising material and labor costs. Generally, we are able to pass the increase in input costs along to our customers. Net sales in the six months ended September 26, 2020 were more negatively impacted by COVID-19 related plant shutdowns and higher than normal absenteeism. Canadian Factory-built Housing: The Canadian Factory-built Housing segment net sales increased by $36.6 million, or 92.0%, for the six months ended October 2, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year, primarily due to an increase in homes sold of 249, coupled with a 27.6% increase in average home selling price. The increase in volume was due to an increase in demand and production rates. The increase in average selling price was due to pricing actions enacted in response to rising material and labor costs. On a constant currency basis, net sales for the Canadian segment were favorably impacted by approximately $6.8 million due to fluctuations in the translation of the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar during the first six months of fiscal 2022 as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. Net sales in the six months ended September 26, 2020 were more negatively impacted by COVID-19 related plant shutdowns and higher than normal absenteeism.

Selling, general, and administrative expenses for Corporate/Other increased $5.0 million, or 23.8%, during the six months ended October 2, 2021 as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year due to an increase in wages, incentive and equity compensation costs as well as $1.9 million for the investment made to enhance our customer buying experience and supporting systems. INTEREST EXPENSE, NET The following table summarizes the components of interest expense, net for the six months ended October 2, 2021 and September 26, 2020: Six months ended (Dollars in thousands) October 2, 2021 September 26, 2020 $ Change % Change Interest expense $ 1,801 $ 2,061 $ (260 ) (12.6 %) Less: Interest income (307 ) (255 ) (52 ) 20.4 % Interest expense, net $ 1,494 $ 1,806 $ (312 ) (17.3 %) Average outstanding floor plan payable $ 28,946 $ 29,188 Average outstanding long-term debt $ 25,882 $ 77,330 Interest expense, net was $1.5 million for the six months ended October 2, 2021, a decrease of $0.3 million, or 17.3%, compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. The net decrease in expense was primarily due to a lower average outstanding balance on the Company’s revolving credit facility, partially offset by the write-off of deferred financing fees of $0.3 million in association with the previously existing revolving credit facility. OTHER EXPENSE (INCOME) The following table summarizes other income for the six months ended October 2, 2021 and September 26, 2020: Six months ended (Dollars in thousands) October 2, 2021 September 26, 2020 $ Change % Change Other expense (income) $ (43 ) $ (6,813 ) $ 6,770 (99.4 %) Other income decreased $6.8 million, or 99.4%, during the six months ended October 2, 2021, compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. The decrease is due to a reduction in the wage subsidies provided by government sponsored financial assistance programs that were 24 enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The programs included a Canadian wage subsidy benefit of $6.2 million and U.S. federal and state wage subsidy benefit of $0.6 million during the six months ended September 26, 2020. INCOME TAX EXPENSE The following table summarizes income tax expense for the six months ended October 2, 2021 and September 26, 2020: Six months ended (Dollars in thousands) October 2, 2021 September 26, 2020 $ Change % Change Income tax expense $ 30,419 $ 10,209 $ 20,210 198.0 % Effective tax rate 24.5 % 25.8 % Income tax expense for the six months ended October 2, 2021 was $30.4 million, representing an effective tax rate of 24.5%, compared to income tax expense of $10.2 million, representing an effective tax rate of 25.8% for the six months ended September 26, 2020. The Company’s effective tax rate for the six months ended October 2, 2021 differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of 21.0% due primarily to the effect of state and local income taxes, non-deductible expenses, tax credits, results in foreign jurisdictions, and tax benefits from vested equity compensation. The Company’s effective tax rate for the six months ended September 26, 2020 differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of 21.0% due primarily to the effect of non-deductible expenses, state and local income taxes, tax credits, and results in foreign jurisdictions. 25 ADJUSTED EBITDA The following table reconciles net income, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, to Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the six months ended October 2, 2021 and September 26, 2020: Six months ended (Dollars in thousands) October 2, 2021 September 26, 2020 $ Change % Change Net income $ 93,624 $ 29,414 $ 64,210 * Income tax expense 30,419 10,209 20,210 * Interest expense, net 1,494 1,806 (312 ) (17.3 %) Depreciation and amortization 10,283 8,690 1,593 18.3 % Equity-based compensation (for awards granted prior to December 31, 2018) — 1,358 (1,358 ) * Adjusted EBITDA $ 135,820 $ 51,477 $ 84,343 * * Indicates that the calculated percentage is not meaningful Adjusted EBITDA for the six months ended October 2, 2021 was $135.8 million, an increase of $84.3 million, from the same period of the prior fiscal year. The increase is primarily a result of higher operating income due to increases in sales volume and gross margin, partially offset by higher SG&A expenses. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss plus; (a) the provision for income taxes; (b) interest expense, net; (c) depreciation and amortization; (d) gain or loss from discontinued operations; (e) equity based compensation for awards granted prior to December 31, 2018; (f) non-cash restructuring charges and impairment of assets; and (g) other non-operating costs including those for the acquisition and integration or disposition of businesses and idle facilities. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of earnings calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income or loss prepared on a U.S. GAAP basis. Adjusted EBITDA does not purport to represent cash flow provided by, or used in, operating activities as defined by U.S. GAAP, which is presented in the Statement of Cash Flows. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, investors should be aware that, in the future, the Company may incur expenses similar to those adjusted for in this presentation. This presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an implication that the Company’s future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items. Adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are: Adjusted EBITDA: Also about Adjusted EBITDA: Given these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our U.S. GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures only on a supplemental basis. 26 BACKLOG Although orders from customers can be cancelled at any time without penalty, and unfilled orders are not necessarily an indication of future business, the Company’s unfilled U.S. and Canadian manufacturing orders at October 2, 2021 totaled $1,369 million compared to $390.1 million at September 26, 2020. The increase in backlog was driven by increased demand for single-family homes, which resulted in order levels that significantly outpaced production in both the U.S. and Canada. Our ability to increase production rates to keep pace with orders is limited by individual plant capacity, the availability of and time needed to train new employees, employee attendance and availability of materials, including (most recently) raw material allocations by certain of our suppliers. We may experience greater order cancellations in the future as a result of higher prices and the longer time required to manufacture and deliver our products. Liquidity and Capital Resources Sources and Uses of Cash The following table presents summary cash flow information for the six months ended October 2, 2021 and September 26, 2020: Six months ended (Dollars in thousands) October 2, 2021 September 26, 2020 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 88,887 $ 63,842 Investing activities (15,246 ) (1,334 ) Financing activities (25,553 ) (8,936 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents (411 ) 1,259 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents 47,677 54,831 Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period 262,581 209,455 Cash and cash equivalents at end of period $ 310,258 $ 264,286 The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and existing cash balances. Cash balances and cash flows from operations for the next year are expected to be adequate to cover working capital requirements, capital expenditures, and debt payment obligations. The Company does not have any scheduled long-term debt maturities in the next twelve months. On July 7, 2021, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement which provides for a $200.0 million revolving credit facility, including a $45.0 million letter of credit sub-facility. At October 2, 2021 $169.6 million was available for borrowing under the Amended Credit Agreement. The Company’s revolving credit facility includes (i) a maximum consolidated total net leverage ratio of 3.25 to 1.00, subject to an upward adjustment upon the consummation of a material acquisition, and (ii) a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.00 to 1.00. The Company anticipates compliance with its debt covenants and projects its level of cash availability to be in excess of cash needed to operate the business for the next year. In the event operating cash flow and existing cash balances were deemed inadequate to support the Company’s liquidity needs, and one or more capital resources were to become unavailable, the Company would revise operating strategies accordingly. Cash provided by operating activities was $88.9 million for the six months ended October 2, 2021 compared to $63.8 million for the six months ended September 26, 2020. Cash provided by operating activities increased due to higher net income, partially offset by an increase in inventory from higher material costs and higher stocking levels to mitigate supply chain challenges, an increase in accounts receivable from higher sales volumes, and an increase in prepaid and other assets primarily from the capitalization of cloud computing costs in fiscal 2022. Cash used in investing activities was $15.2 million for the six months ended October 2, 2021 compared to $1.3 million for the six months ended September 26, 2020. The increase in cash used for investing activities was primarily related to an increase in capital expenditures in the current period which was related to the acquisition of two idle manufacturing facilities in Texas and investments in plant operations which were deferred in the prior-year due to the pandemic. The Company suspended all but critical capital projects in the first half of fiscal 2021 due to COVID-19 concerns. Capital spending in the first half of fiscal 2022 reflects our reversion to normal, planned spending. Cash used in financing activities was $25.6 million for the six months ended October 2, 2021 compared to $8.9 million for the six months ended September 26, 2020. The increase in cash used for financing was primarily related to the repayment of the Company's previously existing revolving credit facility and payments of deferred financing fees related to the Amended Credit Agreement.

Basis of Presentation and Business Nature of Operations: Skyline Champion Corporation (the “Company”) is a leading producer of factory-built housing in the United States (“U.S.”) and Canada. The Company’s operations consist of manufacturing, retail, and transportation activities. The Company operates 35 manufacturing facilities throughout the U.S. and five manufacturing facilities in western Canada. These facilities primarily construct factory-built, timber-framed manufactured, and modular houses that are sold primarily to independent retailers, builders/developers, and manufactured home community operators. The Company’s retail operations consist of 18 sales centers that sell manufactured houses to consumers primarily in the Southern U.S. The Company’s transportation business engages independent owners/drivers to transport manufactured homes, recreational vehicles and other products throughout the U.S. and Canada. COVID-19 Government Financial Assistance: The outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (""COVID-19"") was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. Various government programs were announced to provide financial relief for affected businesses, including the Employee Retention Credit under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (""CARES Act"") and state level programs in the United States and the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (""CEWS"") under the COVID-19 Economic Response Plan in Canada. The Company recognized $ 3.6 million for payroll subsidies under CEWS and $ 0.6 million for wage subsidies under the CARES Act and other state level programs in the United States during the first quarter of fiscal 2021. The Company’s policy is to account for these subsidies as Other Income in the period in which the related costs are incurred and the Company is reasonably assured to receive payment. In addition, the CARES Act allows for deferring payment of certain payroll taxes. Through July 3, 2021 , the Company has deferred $ 11.8 million of payroll taxes that will be paid beginning in December 2021. Basis of Presentation: The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) for Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Article 10 of SEC Regulation S-X. Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“U.S. GAAP”) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany balances and transactions. In the opinion of management, these statements include all normal recurring adjustments necessary to fairly state the Company’s consolidated results of operations, cash flows, and financial position. The Company has evaluated subsequent events after the balance sheet date through the date of the filing of this report with the SEC. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the SEC on May 26, 2021 (the “Fiscal 2021 Annual Report”). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The condensed consolidated income statements, condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income, and condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations or cash flows for the full year. The Company’s allowance for credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost reflects management’s estimate of credit losses over the remaining expected life of such assets, measured primarily using historical experience, as well as current economic conditions and forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. Expected credit losses for newly recognized financial assets, as well as changes to expected credit losses during the period, are recognized in earnings. Accounts receivable are reflected net of reserves of $ 0.5 million and $ 0.4 million at July 3, 2021 and April 3, 2021, respectively. At both July 3, 2021 and April 3, 2021, other notes receivable are reflected net of reserves of $ 0.4 million. Certain prior fiscal year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation. The Company’s fiscal year is a 52- or 53-week period that ends on the Saturday nearest to March 31. The Company’s current fiscal year, “fiscal 2022,” will end on April 2, 2022 and will include 52 weeks. References to “fiscal 2021” refer to the Company’s fiscal year ended April 3, 2021. The three months ended July 3, 2021 and June 27, 2020 each included 13 weeks. There were no accounting standards recently issued that are expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations. 2. Business Acquisition ScotBilt Acquisition 6 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued On February 28, 2021 , the Company acquired 100 % of the membership interests of ScotBilt Homes, LLC and related companies (“ScotBilt”), a builder of manufactured homes with annual revenues of approximately $ 79.0 million, for a purchase price of $ 53.0 million. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, the preliminary purchase price was adjusted for cash held by ScotBilt at the closing date and working capital adjustments resulting in total purchase consideration of $ 54.5 million and total cash paid to sellers of $ 54.1 million. In the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company reduced the preliminary purchase price allocation by $ 0.2 million as a result of the final working capital adjustments. The Company accounted for the acquisition as a business combination under the acquisition method of accounting provided by FASB ASC 805, Business Combinations (“ASC 805”). As such, the purchase price was allocated to the net assets acquired, inclusive of intangible assets, with the excess fair value recorded to goodwill. The purchase price allocation for this acquisition is preliminary and could change. The preliminary allocation of the purchase price was as follows: (Dollars in thousands) Cash $ 1,521 Trade accounts receivable 2,256 Inventory 6,752 Property, plant, and equipment 10,466 Other assets 1,164 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities ( 7,432 ) Intangibles 21,100 Goodwill 18,449 Total purchase price allocation $ 54,276 Goodwill is primarily attributable to expected synergies from the combination of the companies, including, but not limited to, expected cost synergies through procurement activities and operational improvements through sharing of best practices. Goodwill, which is deductible for income tax purposes, was allocated to the U.S. Factory-built Housing reporting unit. Cash, trade accounts receivable, inventory, other assets, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities were generally stated at historical carrying values given the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities. Intangible assets include $ 13.0 million in customer relationships and $ 8.1 million associated with the ScotBilt trade name and were based on an independent appraisal. The fair value of the customer relationships was determined using the multi-period excess earnings method and the fair value of the trade name was determined using the relief-from-royalty method. The Company estimates that each intangible asset has a weighted average useful life of ten years from the acquisition date. Fair value estimates of property, plant, and equipment were based on independent appraisals, giving consideration to the highest and best use of the assets. Key assumptions used in the appraisals were based on a combination of market, cost, and sales comparison approaches, as appropriate. Level 3 fair value estimates of $ 10.5 million related to property, plant, and equipment and $ 21.1 million related to intangible assets were recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of April 3, 2021. The acquisition of ScotBilt was a taxable business combination. Therefore, the Company’s tax basis in the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed approximate the respective fair values at the acquisition date. 3. Inventories, net The components of inventory, net of reserves for obsolete inventory, were as follows: (Dollars in thousands) July 3, 2021 April 3, 2021 Raw materials $ 109,950 $ 91,916 Work in process 23,090 21,642 Finished goods and other 58,556 52,555 Total inventories, net $ 191,596 $ 166,113 At July 3, 2021 and April 3, 2021 , reserves for obsolete inventory were $ 4.6 million. 7 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued 4. Property, Plant, and Equipment Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated primarily on a straight-line basis, generally over the following estimated useful lives: land improvements – 3 to 10 years; buildings and improvements – 8 to 25 years ; and vehicles and machinery and equipment – 3 to 8 years . Depreciation expense for the three months ended July 3, 2021 and June 27, 2020 was $ 3.3 million and $ 2.9 million, respectively. The components of property, plant, and equipment were as follows: (Dollars in thousands) July 3, 2021 April 3, 2021 Land and improvements $ 38,455 $ 36,470 Buildings and improvements 95,789 97,005 Machinery and equipment 59,052 57,790 Construction in progress 9,393 1,889 Property, plant, and equipment, at cost 202,689 193,154 Less: accumulated depreciation ( 81,376 ) ( 78,014 ) Property, plant, and equipment, net $ 121,313 $ 115,140 5. Goodwill, Intangible Assets, and Cloud Computing Arrangements Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. At July 3, 2021 and April 3, 2021 , the Company had goodwill of $ 192.0 million and $ 191.8 million, respectively. Intangible Assets The components of amortizable intangible assets were as follows: (Dollars in thousands) July 3, 2021 April 3, 2021 Customer Relationships Trade Names Total Customer Relationships Trade Names Total Gross carrying amount $ 62,058 $ 21,448 $ 83,506 $ 61,963 $ 21,409 $ 83,372 Accumulated amortization ( 19,662 ) ( 6,897 ) ( 26,559 ) ( 18,158 ) ( 6,379 ) $ ( 24,537 ) Amortizable intangibles, net $ 42,396 $ 14,551 $ 56,947 $ 43,805 $ 15,030 $ 58,835 During the three months ended July 3, 2021 and June 27, 2020 , amortization of intangible assets was $ 1.9 million and $ 1.4 million, respectively. Cloud Computing Arrangements The Company capitalizes costs associated with the development of cloud computing arrangements in a manner consistent with internally developed technology. At July 3, 2021 and April 3, 2021, the Company had capitalized cloud computing costs of $ 5.4 million and $ 0.3 million within other noncurrent assets, respectively. There was no amortization of capitalized cloud computing costs during the three months ended July 3, 2021 and June 27, 2020. 8 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued 6. Other Current Liabilities The components of other current liabilities were as follows: (Dollars in thousands) July 3, 2021 April 3, 2021 Customer deposits $ 64,551 $ 58,888 Accrued volume rebates 19,834 18,207 Accrued warranty obligations 24,643 24,033 Accrued compensation and payroll taxes 38,663 42,560 Accrued insurance 13,762 12,421 Other 32,133 24,586 Total other current liabilities $ 193,586 $ 180,695 7.

Debt and Floor Plan Payable Long-term debt consisted of the following: (Dollars in thousands) July 3, 2021 April 3, 2021 Revolving credit facility maturing in 2023 $ 26,900 $ 26,900 Obligations under industrial revenue bonds due 2029 12,430 12,430 Total debt 39,330 39,330 Less: current portion — — Total long-term debt $ 39,330 $ 39,330 The Company has an agreement with a syndicate of banks that provides for a revolving credit facility of up to $ 100.0 million, including a letter of credit sub-facility of not less than $ 45.0 million (“Credit Agreement”). The revolving credit facility allows the Company to draw down, repay and re-draw loans on the available funds during the term of the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement matures on June 5, 2023 and has no scheduled amortization. The interest rate on borrowings under the Credit Agreement adjusts based on the first lien net leverage of the Company from a high of LIBOR plus 2.25 % and ABR plus 1.25 % when the first lien net leverage is equal to or greater than 2.00 :1.00, to a low of LIBOR plus 1.50 % and ABR plus 0.50 % when the first lien net leverage is below 0.50:1.00. In addition, the Company is obligated to pay an unused line fee ranging between 0.25 % and 0.40 % (depending on the first lien net leverage) in respect of unused commitments under the Credit Agreement. At July 3, 2021 the interest rate on borrowings under the Credit Agreement was 1.6 %. At July 3, 2021 , letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement totaled $ 30.4 million and total available borrowings were $ 42.7 million. Obligations under industrial revenue bonds are supported by letters of credit and bear interest based on a municipal bond index rate. The weighted-average interest rate at July 3, 2021 , including related costs and fees, was 2.13 %. The industrial revenue bonds require lump-sum payments of principal upon maturity in 2029 . 9 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued The Credit Agreement contains covenants that restrict the amount of additional debt, liens and certain payments, including equity buybacks, investments, dispositions, mergers and consolidations, among other restrictions as defined. The Company was in compliance with all covenants of the Credit Agreement as of July 3, 2021. On July 7, 2021, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement which amended and restated the Credit Agreement. See Note 14, ""Subsequent Events."" Floor Plan Payable The Company’s retail operations utilize floor plan financing to fund the purchase of manufactured homes for display or resale. At July 3, 2021 and April 3, 2021 , the Company had outstanding borrowings on floor plan financing agreements of $ 28.8 million and $ 25.7 million, respectively. Total credit line capacity provided under the agreements was $ 57.0 million as of July 3, 2021 . Borrowings are secured by the homes and are required to be repaid when the Company sells the home to a customer. 9. Revenue Recognition The following tables disaggregate the Company’s revenue by sales category for the three months ended July 3, 2021 and June 27, 2020: Three months ended July 3, 2021 (Dollars in thousands) U.S. Factory-Built Housing Canadian Factory-Built Housing Corporate/ Other Total Manufacturing and retail $ 455,891 $ 37,831 $ — $ 493,722 Commercial 1,429 — — 1,429 Transportation — — 15,046 15,046 Total $ 457,320 $ 37,831 $ 15,046 $ 510,197 Three months ended June 27, 2020 (Dollars in thousands) U.S. Factory-Built Housing Canadian Factory-Built Housing Corporate/ Other Total Manufacturing and retail $ 248,859 $ 15,195 $ — $ 264,054 Commercial — — — — Transportation — — 9,231 9,231 Total $ 248,859 $ 15,195 $ 9,231 $ 273,285 10. Income Taxes For the three months ended July 3, 2021 and June 27, 2020 , the Company recorded $ 14.0 million and $ 4.6 million of income tax expense and had an effective tax rate of 24.6 % and 27.7 %, respectively. The Company’s effective tax rate for the three months ended July 3, 2021 differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of 21.0 % due primarily to the effect of state and local income taxes, non-deductible expenses, tax credits, results in foreign jurisdictions and tax benefits from vested equity compensation. The Company’s effective tax rate for the three months ended June 27, 2020 differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of 21.0 % due primarily to the effect of state and local income taxes, non-deductible expenses and results in foreign jurisdictions. At July 3, 2021 , the Company had no unrecognized tax benefits. The Company does not anticipate any material changes to uncertain tax benefits in the next twelve months. The Company records interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. 11. Earnings Per Share Basic net income per share (“EPS”) attributable to the Company was computed by dividing net income attributable to the Company by the average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Certain of the Company’s time-based restricted share awards were 10 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued considered participating securities prior to the completion of the vesting period. The vesting for these time-based shares was completed in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. Diluted earnings per common share is computed based on the more dilutive of: (i) the two class method, assuming the participating securities are not exercised or converted; or (ii) the summation of average common shares outstanding and additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential common shares had been issued. During the three months ended June 27, 2020, the two-class method was more dilutive. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share: Three months ended (Dollars and shares in thousands, except per share data) July 3, 2021 June 27, 2020 Numerator: Net income $ 42,901 $ 11,903 Undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities — ( 30 ) Net income attributable to the Company's common shareholders $ 42,901 $ 11,873 Denominator: Basic weighted-average shares outstanding 56,706 56,532 Dilutive securities 497 229 Diluted weighted-average shares outstanding 57,203 56,761 Basic net income per share $ 0.76 $ 0.21 Diluted net income per share $ 0.75 $ 0.21 12. Segment Information Financial results for the Company's reportable segments have been prepared using a management approach, which is consistent with the basis and manner in which financial information is evaluated by the Company's chief operating decision maker in allocating resources and in assessing performance. The Company’s chief operating decision maker, the Chief Executive Officer, evaluates the performance of the Company’s segments primarily based on net sales, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (“EBITDA”) and operating assets. The Company operates in two reportable segments: (i) U.S. Factory-built Housing, which includes manufacturing and retail housing operations and (ii) Canadian Factory-built Housing. Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation operations, corporate costs incurred for all segments and intersegment eliminations. Segments are generally determined by geography. Segment data includes intersegment revenues and corporate office costs that are directly and exclusively incurred for each segment. Total assets for Corporate/Other primarily includes cash and certain deferred tax items not specifically allocated to another segment. 11 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued Selected financial information by reportable segment was as follows: Three months ended (Dollars in thousands) July 3, 2021 June 27, 2020 Net sales: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 457,320 $ 248,859 Canadian Factory-built Housing 37,831 15,195 Corporate/Other 15,046 9,231 Consolidated net sales $ 510,197 $ 273,285 Operating income: U.S. Factory-built Housing EBITDA $ 63,017 $ 23,793 Canadian Factory-built Housing EBITDA 5,666 1,292 Corporate/Other EBITDA ( 5,977 ) ( 7,607 ) Other income ( 54 ) — Depreciation ( 3,257 ) ( 2,921 ) Amortization ( 1,888 ) ( 1,361 ) Consolidated operating income $ 57,507 $ 13,196 Depreciation: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 2,610 $ 2,398 Canadian Factory-built Housing 285 115 Corporate/Other 362 408 Consolidated depreciation $ 3,257 $ 2,921 Amortization of U.S. Factory-built Housing intangible assets: $ 1,888 $ 1,361 Capital expenditures: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 7,258 $ 885 Canadian Factory-built Housing 105 157 Corporate/Other 1,858 269 Consolidated capital expenditures $ 9,221 $ 1,311 (Dollars in thousands) July 3, 2021 April 3, 2021 Total Assets: U.S. Factory-built Housing (1) $ 602,941 $ 578,897 Canadian Factory-built Housing (1) 91,561 87,224 Corporate/Other (1) 291,895 251,781 Consolidated total assets $ 986,397 $ 917,902 13. Commitments, Contingencies and Legal Proceedings Repurchase Contingencies and Guarantees The Company is contingently liable under terms of repurchase agreements with lending institutions that provide wholesale floor plan financing to retailers. These arrangements, which are customary in the manufactured housing industry, provide for the repurchase of products sold to retailers in the event of default by the retailer on its agreement to pay the financial institution. The risk of loss from these agreements is spread over numerous retailers. The repurchase price is generally determined by the original sales price of the product less contractually defined curtailment payments. Excluding the resale value of the homes, the contingent repurchase obligation as of July 3, 2021 was estimated to be $ 231.0 million. The Company accounts for the guarantees under its repurchase agreements with the retailers’ financing institutions by estimating and deferring a portion of the related product sale that represents the estimated fair value of the repurchase obligation. In addition, the Company has estimated the expected contingent net loss the Company will incur upon resale of any repurchases. These estimates are based on recent historical experience supplemented by management’s assessment of current economic and other conditions affecting retailers for which the Company has a contingent repurchase obligation. Based on these repurchase agreements and historical loss experience, as well as current economic conditions and forecasts that affect the potential loss exposure, a loss reserve of $ 1.5 million and $ 1.4 million was recorded 12 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued as of July 3, 2021 and April 3, 2021, respectively. Losses incurred on homes repurchased were not significant during the three months ended July 3, 2021 or June 27, 2020. At July 3, 2021 , the Company was contingently obligated for $ 30.4 million under letters of credit, primarily consisting of $ 12.6 million to support long-term debt, $ 17.5 million to support the casualty insurance program, and $ 0.3 million to support bonding agreements. The letters of credit are issued from a sub-facility of the Credit Agreement. The Company was also contingently obligated for $ 35.0 million under surety bonds, generally to support performance on long-term construction contracts and license and service bonding requirements. In the normal course of business, the Company’s former subsidiaries that operated in the United Kingdom historically provided certain guarantees to two customers. Those guarantees provide contractual liability for proven construction defects up to 12 years from the date of delivery of certain products. The guarantees remain a contingent liability of the Company which declines over time through October 2027. As of the date of this report, the Company expects few, if any, claims to be reported under the terms of the guarantees. Legal Proceedings The Company has agreed to indemnify counterparties in the ordinary course of its business in agreements to acquire and sell business assets and in financing arrangements. The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of its business. As of the date of this filing, the Company believes the ultimate liability with respect to these contingent obligations will not have, either individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 13 14. Subsequent Event On July 7, 2021, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with a syndicate of banks (the ""2021 Credit Agreement""). The 2021 Credit Agreement provides for a $ 200.0 million revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”), including a $ 45.0 million letter of credit sub-facility. The 2021 Credit Agreement amended and restated the Company’s existing $ 100.0 million revolving credit facility. Outstanding borrowings of $ 26.9 million on the Company’s existing revolving credit facility were repaid at the time of closing. The Revolving Credit Facility may be utilized for working capital, capital expenditures, permitted acquisitions, permitted restricted payments and other general corporate purposes. The Revolving Credit Facility matures on July 7, 2026 , and has no scheduled amortization. 14 Item 2. MANAGEMENT’ S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following should be read in conjunction with Skyline Champion Corporation’s condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear in Item 1 of this Report. Overview Skyline Champion Corporation (the “Company”) is a leading producer of factory-built housing in the U.S. and Canada. The Company serves as a complete solutions provider across complementary and vertically integrated businesses including manufactured offsite construction, company-owned retail locations, and transportation logistics services. The Company is the largest independent publicly traded factory-built solutions provider in North America (based on revenue) and markets its homes under several nationally recognized brand names including Skyline Homes, Champion Home Builders, Genesis Homes, Athens Park Models, Dutch Housing, Excel Homes, Homes of Merit, New Era, Redman Homes, ScotBilt Homes, Shore Park, Silvercrest, Titan Homes in the U.S., and Moduline and SRI Homes in western Canada. The Company operates 35 manufacturing facilities throughout the U.S. and five manufacturing facilities in western Canada that primarily construct factory-built, timber-framed, manufactured and modular houses that are sold primarily to independent retailers, builders/developers, and manufactured home community operators. The Company’s retail operations consist of 18 sales centers that sell manufactured homes to consumers primarily in the southern U.S. The Company’s transportation business engages independent owners/drivers to transport manufactured homes, recreational vehicles, and other products throughout the U.S. and Canada. Industry and Company Outlook Since July 2020, U.S. and Canadian housing industry demand has been robust. The limited availability of existing homes for sale and the broader need for newly built affordable, single-family housing has continued to drive demand for new homes in these markets. In recent years, manufactured home construction experienced revenue growth due to a number of favorable demographic trends and demand drivers in the United States, including underlying growth trends in key homebuyer groups, such as the population over 55 years of age, the population of first-time home buyers, and the population of households earning less than $60,000 per year. More recently, we have seen a number of market trends pointing to increased sales of accessory dwelling units and urban-to-rural migration as customers accommodate working-from-home patterns, as well as people seeking rent-to-own single-family options. The robust demand environment has resulted in backlog of $1,200 million as of July 3, 2021 compared to $192.1 million as of June 27, 2020. Generally higher backlog at our manufacturing facilities creates an opportunity to increase production efficiencies. Although the higher demand brings opportunities, it also has resulted in significant increases in certain material input costs, especially forest products. We manage our business to anticipate these cost increases and generally are able to pass them along to our customers. Historically order cancellation rates have been very low, however, the longer lead-time caused by larger backlogs and changing prices may lead to increased cancellations in future periods. For the three months ended July 3, 2021, approximately 80% of the Company’s U.S. manufacturing sales were generated from the manufacture of homes that comply with the Federal HUD code construction standard in the U.S. Industry shipments of HUD-code homes are reported on a one month lag. According to data reported by MHI, HUD-code industry home shipments were 27,857 and 21,667 units during the three months ended May 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Based on industry data, the Company’s U.S. wholesale market share of HUD code homes sold was 20.8% and 13.8%, for the three months ended May 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Annual shipments have generally increased each year since calendar year 2009 when only 50,000 HUD-coded manufactured homes were shipped, the lowest level since the industry began recording statistics in 1959. While shipments of HUD-coded manufactured homes have improved modestly in recent years, manufactured housing’s most recent annual shipment levels still operate at lower levels than the long-term historical average of over 200,000 units annually. Acquisitions and Expansions Over the last several years, demand for the Company’s products, primarily affordable housing in the U.S., has continued to improve. As a result, the Company has focused on operational improvements to make existing manufacturing facilities more profitable as well as executing measured expansion of its manufacturing and retail footprints. The Company has increased capacity through strategic acquisitions and expansions of its manufacturing operations. The Company is focused on growing in strong HUD markets across the U.S. as well as further expanding into the Northeast and Midwest U.S. modular housing markets. On June 21, 2021, the Company acquired two idle facilities in Navasota, Texas in order to strengthen its production capabilities in the Texas market. The Company intends to initiate production in one or both of these facilities by the end of fiscal 2022. On February 28, 2021, the Company acquired ScotBilt. In calendar 2020, ScotBilt shipped over 1,600 homes from its two manufacturing facilities in Georgia providing affordable housing throughout Alabama, Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas. ScotBilt has approximately 400 employees in its two manufacturing facilities. The Company believes ScotBilt is an excellent fit because of the compatible company cultures, and ScotBilt’s strong 15 presence in the attractive Mid-South region, which helps to balance national distribution and complements the Company’s existing manufacturing footprint. The operations of ScotBilt are included in the financial results of the Company since the date of the acquisition. On January 14, 2021, the Company acquired two idled facilities in Pembroke, North Carolina, which provides an opportunity to further expand its manufacturing footprint in the South and Southeast markets. The Company is currently assessing prospects for initiating production in one or both of these facilities. The Company's acquisitions and investments are part of a strategy to grow and diversify revenue with a focus on increasing the Company’s HUD and modular homebuilding presence in the U.S. as well as improving the results of operations. These acquisitions and investments are included in the Company's consolidated results for periods subsequent to their respective acquisition dates. COVID-19 Pandemic The outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (""COVID-19"") was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. There remains continued uncertainty regarding the extent and duration of the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on the economy, the housing market, and the Company, as well as the Company’s employees, customers, and suppliers. The Company has prioritized the safety and well-being of its employees and customers and has implemented standards to operate in accordance with social-distancing protocols and public health authority guidelines. Beginning in March 2020, the Company took actions to temporarily idle certain facilities in response to government shutdown orders or reduced demand. By late April 2020, most of the temporarily idled manufacturing facilities had reopened, but at reduced production levels due to employee absenteeism, difficulty hiring new team members and social distancing protocols. During fiscal 2021, the Company experienced intermittent closures due to COVID-19 outbreaks at the facilities or surrounding communities causing higher than normal absenteeism. In the second half of fiscal 2021, the Company was able to increase daily production rates over the levels achieved in the prior fiscal year period as direct labor staffing levels increased and production efficiencies improved. As of July 3, 2021, availability of labor and certain materials remain subject to disruption and uncertainty. Prices for key raw materials have experienced increased volatility and, overall, manufacturing costs have trended higher than prior periods. In the first quarter of fiscal 2021, in response to the pandemic, the Company offered extended benefits to employees, including increased sick pay and waived premium payments on healthcare benefits for furloughed employees. The Company’s U.S. operations incurred $1.9 million of expense related to those extended benefits in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Various government programs were announced to provide financial relief for affected businesses, including the Employee Retention Credit under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (""CARES Act"") and state level programs in the United States and the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (""CEWS"") under the COVID-19 Economic Response Plan in Canada. CEWS provides a cash subsidy of up to 75% of eligible employees’ remuneration, subject to certain criteria. The Company recognized $3.6 million for payroll subsidies under CEWS and $0.6 million for wage subsidies under the CARES Act and other state level programs in the United States during the first quarter of fiscal 2021. In addition, the CARES Act allows for deferring payment of certain payroll taxes.

The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. U.S. Factory-built Housing: Net sales for the Company’s U.S. manufacturing and retail operations increased by $208.5 million, or 83.8%, for the three months ended July 3, 2021 compared to the three months ended June 27, 2020. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of homes sold during the three months ended July 3, 2021 of 58.2%, as well as an increase in the average home selling price of 16.2%, and the impact of 17 ScotBilt. The increase in the number of homes sold was due to strong demand which resulted in increased production levels at many of the Company’s manufacturing locations. The average selling price increased due to pricing actions enacted in response to rising material costs. Net sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 were also negatively impacted by COVID-19 related plant shutdowns and higher than normal absenteeism. Canadian Factory-built Housing: The Canadian Factory-built Housing segment net sales increased by $22.6 million, or 149.0% for the three months ended July 3, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year, primarily due to a 100.5% increase in the number of homes sold, coupled with a 24.3% increase in average home selling price. The increase in volume was due to an increase in demand and production rates. The increase in average selling price was due to pricing actions enacted in response to rising material costs. On a constant currency basis, net sales for the Canadian segment were favorably impacted by approximately $4.5 million due to fluctuations in the translation of the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar during the first three months of fiscal 2022 as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. Corporate/Other: Net sales for Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation business and the elimination of intersegment sales. For the three months ended July 3, 2021, net sales increased $5.8 million, or 63.0%, primarily attributable to an increase in demand in the recreational vehicles and manufactured housing industries. GROSS PROFIT The following table summarizes gross profit for the three months ended July 3, 2021 and June 27, 2020: Three months ended (Dollars in thousands) July 3, 2021 June 27, 2020 $ Change % Change Gross profit: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 99,211 $ 48,410 $ 50,801 104.9 % Canadian Factory-built Housing 8,325 2,782 5,543 199.2 % Corporate/Other 3,994 2,811 1,183 42.1 % Total gross profit $ 111,530 $ 54,003 $ 57,527 106.5 % Gross profit as a percent of net sales 21.9 % 19.8 % Gross profit as a percent of sales during the three months ended July 3, 2021 was 21.9% compared to 19.8% during the three months ended June 27, 2020. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. U.S. Factory-built Housing: Gross profit for the U.S. Factory-built Housing segment increased by $50.8 million, or 104.9%, during the three months ended July 3, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. Gross profit was 21.7% as a percent of segment net sales for the three months ended July 3, 2021compared to 19.5% in the same period of the prior fiscal year. The increase in gross profit is due to operational efficiencies and increased leverage of manufacturing fixed costs caused by higher production volumes as well as a reduction of COVID-19 related sick-pay and health benefits provided in the prior fiscal year, all partially offset by higher material and labor costs. Canadian Factory-built Housing: Gross profit for the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment increased by $5.5 million, or 199.2% during the three months ended July 3, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year primarily due to increased sales volume. Gross profit as a percent of net sales was 22.0% for the three months ended July 3, 2021, compared to 18.3% in the same period of the prior fiscal year due to direct labor and manufacturing efficiencies from the increase in home sales volumes, partially offset by higher material and labor costs. Corporate/Other: Gross profit for the Corporate/Other segment increased $1.2 million, or 42.1%, during the three months ended July 3, 2021 compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, primarily due to increased net sales in the Company’s transportation operations. Gross profit decreased as a percent of segment net sales to 26.5% from 30.5% as a result of changes in revenue mix. 18 SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Selling, general, and administrative expenses include foreign currency transaction gains and losses, equity compensation, and intangible amortization expense. The following table summarizes selling, general, and administrative expenses for the three months ended July 3, 2021 and June 27, 2020: Three months ended (Dollars in thousands) July 3, 2021 June 27, 2020 $ Change % Change Selling, general, and administrative expenses: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 40,755 $ 28,376 $ 12,379 43.6 % Canadian Factory-built Housing 2,945 1,606 1,339 83.4 % Corporate/Other 10,323 10,825 (502 ) (4.6 %) Total selling, general, and administrative expenses $ 54,023 $ 40,807 $ 13,216 32.4 % Selling, general, and administrative expense as a percent of net sales 10.6 % 14.9 % Selling, general, and administrative expenses were $54.0 million for the three months ended July 3, 2021, an increase of $13.2 million , or 32.4%, compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. U.S. Factory-built Housing: Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the U.S. Factory-built Housing segment increased $12.4 million, or 43.6%, during the three months ended July 3, 2021 as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. Selling, general, and administrative expenses, as a percent of segment net sales decreased to 8.9% for the three months ended July 3, 2021 compared to 11.4% during the comparable period of the prior fiscal year primarily due to increased leverage of fixed costs. The increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses resulted from the following factors: (i) higher sales commissions and incentive compensation, which is generally based on sales volume or a measure of profitability; (ii) higher wage expense from headcount increases due to the growth in housing demand; (iii) an increase in travel expenses compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year; and (iv) the impact of ScotBilt. Canadian Factory-built Housing: Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment increased $1.3 million, or 83.4%, for the three months ended July 3, 2021 when compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percent of segment net sales decreased to 7.8% for the three months ended July 3, 2021 compared to 10.6% during the comparable period of the prior fiscal year primarily due to increased leverage of fixed costs caused by the increase in net sales. The increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses resulted from an increase in commissions and incentive compensation as well as wage expense from headcount increases due to the growth in housing demand. Corporate/Other: Selling, general, and administrative expenses for Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation operations, corporate costs incurred for all segments, and intersegment eliminations. Selling, general, and administrative expenses for Corporate/Other decreased $0.5 million, or 4.6%, during the three months ended July 3, 2021 as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year due to a reduction in equity compensation costs. 19 INTEREST EXPENSE, NET The following table summarizes the components of interest expense, net for the three months ended July 3, 2021 and June 27, 2020: Three months ended (Dollars in thousands) July 3, 2021 June 27, 2020 $ Change % Change Interest expense $ 808 $ 1,087 $ (279 ) (25.7 %) Less: Interest income (159 ) (145 ) (14 ) 9.7 % Interest expense, net $ 649 $ 942 $ (293 ) (31.1 %) Average outstanding floor plan payable $ 28,592 $ 31,067 Average outstanding long-term debt $ 39,330 $ 77,330 Interest expense, net was $0.6 million for the three months ended July 3, 2021, a decrease of $0.3 million, or 31.3%, compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. The net decrease in expense was primarily due to a lower average outstanding balance on the Company’s revolving credit facility during the first quarter ended July 3, 2021 versus the same quarter in fiscal 2021. OTHER INCOME The following table summarizes other income for the three months ended July 3, 2021 and June 27, 2020: Three months ended (Dollars in thousands) July 3, 2021 June 27, 2020 $ Change % Change Other income $ (54 ) $ (4,214 ) $ 4,160 (98.7 %) Other income decreased $4.2 million, or 98.7%, during the three months ended July 3, 2021 as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. The decrease is due to a reduction in the wage subsidies provided by government sponsored financial assistance programs that were enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The programs included a Canadian wage subsidy benefit of $3.6 million and U.S. federal and state wage subsidy benefits of $0.6 million during the three months ended June 27, 2020. INCOME TAX EXPENSE The following table summarizes income tax expense for the three months ended July 3, 2021 and June 27, 2020: Three months ended (Dollars in thousands) July 3, 2021 June 27, 2020 $ Change % Change Income tax expense $ 14,011 $ 4,565 $ 9,446 206.9 % Effective tax rate 24.6 % 27.7 % Income tax expense for the three months ended July 3, 2021 was $14.0 million, representing an effective tax rate of 24.6%, compared to income tax expense of $4.6 million, representing an effective tax rate of 27.7% for the three months ended June 27, 2020. The Company’s effective tax rate for the three months ended July 3, 2021 differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of 21.0% due primarily to the effect of state and local income taxes, non-deductible expenses, tax credits, results in foreign jurisdictions, and tax benefits from vested equity compensation. The Company’s effective tax rate for the three months ended June 27, 2020 differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of 21.0% due primarily to the effect of non-deductible expenses, state and local income taxes, and results in foreign jurisdictions. 20 ADJUSTED EBITDA The following table reconciles net income, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, to Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the three months ended July 3, 2021 and June 27, 2020: Three months ended (Dollars in thousands) July 3, 2021 June 27, 2020 $ Change % Change Net income $ 42,901 $ 11,903 $ 30,998 * Income tax expense 14,011 4,565 9,446 * Interest expense, net 649 942 (293 ) (31.1 %) Depreciation and amortization 5,145 4,282 863 20.2 % Equity-based compensation (for awards granted prior to December 31, 2018) — 970 (970 ) * Other — (122 ) 122 * Adjusted EBITDA $ 62,706 $ 22,540 $ 40,166 * * indicates that the calculated percentage is not meaningful Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended July 3, 2021 was $62.7 million, an increase of $40.2 million from the same period of the prior fiscal year. The increase is primarily a result of higher operating income primarily due to increases in sales volume and gross margin, partially offset by higher SG&A expenses. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss plus; (a) the provision for income taxes; (b) interest expense, net; (c) depreciation and amortization; (d) gain or loss from discontinued operations; (e) equity based compensation for awards granted prior to December 31, 2018; (f) non-cash restructuring charges and impairment of assets; and (g) other non-operating costs including those for the acquisition and integration or disposition of businesses and idle facilities. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of earnings calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income or loss prepared on a U.S. GAAP basis. Adjusted EBITDA does not purport to represent cash flow provided by, or used in, operating activities as defined by U.S. GAAP, which is presented in the Statement of Cash Flows. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, investors should be aware that, in the future, the Company may incur expenses similar to those adjusted for in this presentation. This presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an implication that the Company’s future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items. Adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are: Adjusted EBITDA: Given these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our U.S. GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures only on a supplemental basis. BACKLOG Although orders from customers can be cancelled at any time without penalty, and unfilled orders are not necessarily an indication of future business, the Company’s unfilled U.S. and Canadian manufacturing orders at July 3, 2021 totaled $1,200 million compared to $192.1 million at June 27, 2020. The increase in backlog was driven by increased demand for single-family homes which resulted in order levels that significantly outpaced production in both the U.S. and Canada. Increasing production rates to keep pace with orders is limited by individual 21 plant capacity, time to train new employees, employee attendance and availability of materials, including most recently raw material allocations by certain suppliers. Liquidity and Capital Resources Sources and Uses of Cash The following table presents summary cash flow information for the three months ended July 3, 2021 and June 27, 2020: Three months ended (Dollars in thousands) July 3, 2021 June 27, 2020 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 31,905 $ 32,205 Investing activities (9,219 ) (1,299 ) Financing activities 1,798 (4,524 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents 673 670 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents 25,157 27,052 Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period 262,581 209,455 Cash and cash equivalents at end of period $ 287,738 $ 236,507 The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and existing cash balances. Cash balances and cash flows from operations for the next year are expected to be adequate to cover working capital requirements, capital expenditures, and debt payment obligations. The Company does not have any scheduled long-term debt maturities in the next twelve months. The Company’s revolving credit facility includes a leverage ratio covenant that requires the Company’s first lien debt levels to remain less than 2.75 times consolidated trailing twelve-month EBITDA. The leverage ratio was increased to 3.0 times consolidated trailing twelve-month EBITDA for the four quarters subsequent to the acquisition of ScotBilt. The Company anticipates compliance with its debt covenants and projects its level of cash availability to be in excess of cash needed to operate the business for the next year. In the event operating cash flow and existing cash balances were deemed inadequate to support the Company’s liquidity needs, and one or more capital resources were to become unavailable, the Company would revise operating strategies accordingly. Cash provided by operating activities was $31.9 million for the three months ended July 3, 2021 compared to $32.2 million for the three months ended June 27, 2020. Cash provided by operating activities decreased due to an increase in inventory from higher material costs and higher stocking levels to mitigate supply chain challenges, and an increase prepaid and other assets from capitalized cloud computing costs, offset by higher net income. Cash used in investing activities was $9.2 million for the three months ended July 3, 2021 compared to $1.3 million for the three months ended June 27, 2020. The increase in cash used for investing activities was primarily related to an increase in capital expenditures in the current period which was primarily due to the acquisition of an idle manufacturing facility in Texas. Cash provided by financing activities was $1.8 million for the three months ended July 3, 2021 compared to cash used in financing activities of $4.5 million for the three months ended June 27, 2020. Cash provided by financing activities for the first three months of fiscal 2022 was related to increased floor plan financing, offset by tax payments for equity-based compensation. Cash used in financing activities for the first three months of fiscal 2021 was solely related to $4.5 million of net repayments of floorplan payables. On July 7, 2021, the Company entered into the 2021 Credit Agreement which amended and restated the Company's existing $100.0 million revolving credit facility. The 2021 Credit Agreement provides for a $200.0 million revolving credit facility, including a $45.0 million letter of credit sub-facility. Outstanding borrowings of $26.9 million on the Company’s existing revolving credit facility were repaid at the time of closing. The expanded revolving credit facility may be utilized for working capital, capital expenditures, permitted acquisitions, permitted restricted payments and other general corporate purposes, matures on July 7, 2026, and has no scheduled amortization.

See accompanying Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 5 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 1. Basis of Presentation and Business Nature of Operations: Skyline Champion Corporation (the “Company”) is a leading producer of factory-built housing in the United States (“U.S.”) and Canada. The Company’s operations consist of manufacturing, retail, and transportation activities. The Company operates 33 manufacturing facilities throughout the U.S. and five manufacturing facilities in western Canada. These facilities primarily construct factory-built, timber-framed manufactured, and modular houses that are sold primarily to independent retailers, builders/developers, and manufactured home community operators. The Company’s retail operations consist of 18 sales centers that sell manufactured houses to consumers primarily in the Southern U.S. The Company’s transportation business engages independent owners/drivers to transport manufactured homes, recreational vehicles and other products throughout the U.S. and Canada. COVID-19 Government Financial Assistance: The outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (""COVID-19"") was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. Various government programs have been announced to provide financial relief for affected businesses, including the Employee Retention Credit under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (""CARES Act"") and state level programs in the United States and the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (""CEWS"") under the COVID-19 Economic Response Plan in Canada. The Company recognized $ 6.2 million for payroll subsidies under CEWS during the nine months ended December 26, 2020. No payroll subsidy was recognized under CEWS during the three months ended December 26, 2020. The Company also recognized $ 0.2 million and $ 0.8 million during the three and nine months ended December 26, 2020 for wage subsidies under the CARES Act and other state level programs in the United States. The Company’s policy is to account for these subsidies as Other Income in the period in which the related costs are incurred and the Company is reasonably assured to receive payment. As of December 26, 2020, the Company had collected all of the CEWS subsidies for which it has applied. In addition, the CARES Act allows for deferring payment of certain payroll taxes. Through December 26, 2020, the Company has deferred $ 11.6 million of payroll taxes that will be paid beginning in December 2021. Basis of Presentation: The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) for Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Article 10 of SEC Regulation S-X. Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“U.S. GAAP”) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany balances and transactions. In the opinion of management, these statements include all normal recurring adjustments necessary to fairly state the Company’s consolidated results of operations, cash flows, and financial position. The Company has evaluated subsequent events after the balance sheet date through the date of the filing of this report with the SEC. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the SEC on May 21, 2020 (the “Fiscal 2020 Annual Report”). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The condensed consolidated income statements, condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income, and condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations or cash flows for the full year. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation. The Company’s fiscal year is a 52- or 53-week period that ends on the Saturday nearest to March 31. The Company’s current fiscal year, “fiscal 2021,” will end on April 3, 2021 and will include 53 weeks. References to “fiscal 2020” refer to the Company’s fiscal year ended March 28, 2020. The three and nine months ended December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019 each included 13 weeks and 39 weeks, respectively. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements: On March 29, 2020, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (""ASU"") 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments ,” using a modified retrospective approach. The standard amends several aspects of the measurement of credit losses related to certain financial instruments, including the replacement of the existing incurred credit loss model and other models with the current expected credit losses (""CECL"") model. The cumulative effect of adoption resulted in an increase of $ 0.2 million in the allowance for credit loss and a corresponding decrease in retained earnings as of March 29, 2020. The Company’s allowance for credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost reflects management’s estimate of credit losses over the remaining expected life of such assets, measured primarily using historical experience, as well as current economic conditions and forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. Expected credit losses for newly recognized financial assets, as well as changes to expected credit losses during the period, are recognized in earnings. As of December 26, 2020 and March 28, 2020, accounts receivable are reflected net of reserves of $ 0.5 million and $ 0.4 million, respectively. As of December 26, 2020 and March 28, 2020, other notes receivable are reflected net of reserves of $ 0.4 million and $ 0.5 million, respectively. Changes in expected credit losses were not significant in the first nine months of fiscal 2021. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, “ Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350), Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment,” which addresses concerns over the cost and complexity of the two-step impairment testing model, and removes the second step 6 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued of the test. An entity will apply a one-step quantitative test and record the amount of goodwill impairment as the excess of a reporting unit’s carrying amount over its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. The Company adopted the provisions of ASU 2017-04 effective March 29, 2020, and the adoption did not have an impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. There were no other accounting standards recently issued that are expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations. 2 . Inventories, net The components of inventory, net of reserves for obsolete inventory, were as follows: (Dollars in thousands) December 26, 2020 March 28, 2020 Raw materials $ 69,664 $ 55,408 Work in process 19,412 17,773 Finished goods and other 42,047 53,205 Total inventories, net $ 131,123 $ 126,386 At December 26, 2020 and March 28, 2020, reserves for obsolete inventory were $ 4.6 million and $ 4.2 million, respectively. 3 . Property, Plant, and Equipment Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated primarily on a straight-line basis, generally over the following estimated useful lives: land improvements – 3 to 10 years ; buildings and improvements – 8 to 25 years ; and vehicles and machinery and equipment – 3 to 8 years . Depreciation expense for the three months ended December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019 was $ 3.0 million and $ 3.2 million, respectively. Depreciation expense for the nine months ended December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019 was $ 9.0 million and $ 9.8 million, respectively. The components of property, plant, and equipment were as follows: (Dollars in thousands) December 26, 2020 March 28, 2020 Land and improvements $ 35,525 $ 35,332 Buildings and improvements 87,096 87,222 Machinery and equipment 54,423 51,239 Construction in progress 1,981 1,810 Property, plant, and equipment, at cost 179,025 175,603 Less: accumulated depreciation ( 75,199 ) ( 66,312 ) Property, plant, and equipment, net $ 103,826 $ 109,291 4 . Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. At December 26, 2020 and March 28, 2020, the Company had goodwill of $ 173.5 million.

Debt and Floor Plan Payable Long-term debt consisted of the following: (Dollars in thousands) December 26, 2020 March 28, 2020 Revolving credit facility maturing in 2023 $ 26,900 $ 64,900 Obligations under industrial revenue bonds due 2029 12,430 12,430 Total debt 39,330 77,330 Less: current portion — — Total long-term debt $ 39,330 $ 77,330 The Company has an agreement with a syndicate of banks that provides for a revolving credit facility of up to $ 100.0 million, including a letter of credit sub-facility of not less than $ 45.0 million (“Credit Agreement”). The revolving credit facility allows the Company to draw down, repay and re-draw loans on the available funds during the term of the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement matures on June 5, 2023 and has no scheduled amortization. The interest rate on borrowings under the Credit Agreement adjusts based on the first lien net leverage of the Company from a high of LIBOR plus 2.25 % and ABR plus 1.25 % when the first lien net leverage is equal to or greater than 2 .00:1.00, to a low of LIBOR plus 1.50 % and ABR plus 0.50 % when the first lien net leverage is below 0.50:1.00. In addition, the Company is obligated to pay an unused line fee ranging between 0.25 % and 0.40 % (depending on the first lien net leverage) in respect of unused commitments under the Credit Agreement. At December 26, 2020 the interest rate on borrowings under the Credit Agreement was 1.7 %. At December 26, 2020 , letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement totaled $ 33.9 million and total available borrowings were $ 39.2 million. Obligations under industrial revenue bonds are supported by letters of credit and bear interest based on a municipal bond index rate. The weighted-average interest rate at December 26, 2020, including related costs and fees, was 2.19 %. The industrial revenue bonds require lump-sum payments of principal upon maturity in 2029 . 8 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued The Credit Agreement contains covenants that restrict the amount of additional debt, liens and certain payments, including equity buybacks, investments, dispositions, mergers and consolidations, among other restrictions as defined. The Company was in compliance with all covenants of the Credit Agreement as of December 26, 2020 . Floor Plan Payable The Company’s retail operations utilize floor plan financing to fund the purchase of manufactured homes for display or resale. At December 26, 2020 and March 28, 2020, the Company had outstanding borrowings on floor plan financing agreements of $ 25.6 million and $ 33.9 million, respectively. Total credit line capacity provided under the agreements was $ 49.0 million as of December 26, 2020 . Borrowings are secured by the homes and are required to be repaid when the Company sells the home to a customer. 8 .

Leases The Company has operating leases for land, manufacturing and office facilities, and equipment. The Company's lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such option. The Company's leases do not contain material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease terms. Lease expense included in the accompanying condensed consolidated income statements is shown below: Three Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) December 26, 2020 December 28, 2019 Operating lease expense $ 1,362 $ 1,359 Short-term lease expense 266 402 Total lease expense $ 1,628 $ 1,761 Nine Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) December 26, 2020 December 28, 2019 Operating lease expense $ 4,102 $ 4,234 Short-term lease expense 1,251 1,005 Total lease expense $ 5,353 $ 5,239 Operating lease assets and obligations included in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets are below: (Dollars in thousands) December 26, 2020 March 28, 2020 Right-of-use assets under operating leases: Other long-term assets $ 12,515 $ 14,808 Lease obligations under operating leases: Other current liabilities $ 4,305 $ 4,789 Other long-term liabilities 8,210 10,019 Total lease obligation $ 12,515 $ 14,808 Maturities of lease obligations as of December 26, 2020, are shown below: (Dollars in thousands) December 26, 2020 Fiscal 2021 (1) $ 1,294 Fiscal 2022 4,694 Fiscal 2023 3,754 Fiscal 2024 1,803 Fiscal 2025 1,124 Thereafter 1,879 Total undiscounted cash flows 14,548 Less: imputed interest ( 2,033 ) Lease obligations under operating leases $ 12,515 (1) For remaining period in fiscal year. The weighted-average lease term and discount rate for operating leases are shown below: December 26, 2020 Weighted-average remaining lease term (in years) 4.6 Weighted-average discount rate 5.5 10 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued The discount rate used to measure a lease obligation should be the rate implicit in the lease; however, the Company’s operating leases generally do not provide an implicit rate. Accordingly, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate at lease commencement to determine the present value of lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is an entity-specific rate, which represents the rate of interest a lessee would pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term with similar payments. Cash flow information related to operating leases is shown below: Nine Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) December 26, 2020 December 28, 2019 Non-cash activity: Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for operating lease obligations $ 1,430 $ 1,711 Operating cash flows: Cash paid related to operating lease obligations $ 4,255 $ 4,262 1 0 . Income Taxes For the three months ended December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, the Company recorded $ 5.3 million and $ 6.3 million of income tax expense and had an effective tax rate of 19.7 % and 27.0 %, respectively. For the nine months ended December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, the Company recorded $ 15.5 million and $ 20.5 million of income tax expense and had an effective tax rate of 23.3 % and 28.2 %, respectively. During the three months ended December 26, 2020, the Company completed a U.S. research and development (""R&D"") tax credit study for the years 2018 and 2019 that resulted in the recognition of a tax benefit of $ 1.7 million. The Company’s effective tax rate for both the three and nine months ended December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019 differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of 21.0 % due primarily to the effect of non-deductible expenses, state and local income taxes, tax credits, and results in foreign jurisdictions. At December 26, 2020, the Company had no unrecognized tax benefits. The Company does not anticipate any material changes to uncertain tax benefits in the next twelve months. The Company records interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. 1 1 . Earnings Per Share Basic net income per share (“EPS”) attributable to the Company was computed by dividing net income attributable to the Company by the average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Certain of the Company’s time-based restricted share awards were considered participating securities prior to the completion of the vesting period. The vesting for these time-based shares was completed in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. Diluted earnings per common share is computed based on the more dilutive of: (i) the two class method, assuming the participating securities are not exercised or converted; or (ii) the summation of average common shares outstanding and additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential common shares had been issued. During the nine months ended December 26, 2020, and the three and nine months ended December 28, 2019, the two-class method was more dilutive. The two-class method was not applicable to the computation for the three months ended December 26, 2020 as the time-vested restricted share awards were fully vested and no longer considered participating securities during the period. Securities that could potentially dilute basic EPS in the future that were considered antidilutive in the three and nine months ended December 26, 2020 totaled 0.2 million. There were no antidilutive securities in the three and nine months ended December 28, 2019. 11 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share: Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended (Dollars and shares in thousands, except per share data) December 26, 2020 December 28, 2019 December 26, 2020 December 28, 2019 Numerator: Net income $ 21,599 $ 17,037 $ 51,013 $ 52,162 Undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities — ( 44 ) ( 62 ) ( 196 ) Net income attributable to the Company's common shareholders $ 21,599 $ 16,993 $ 50,951 $ 51,966 Denominator: Basic weighted-average shares outstanding 56,702 56,521 56,630 56,457 Dilutive securities 288 267 253 248 Diluted weighted-average shares outstanding 56,990 56,788 56,883 56,705 Basic net income per share $ 0.38 $ 0.30 $ 0.90 $ 0.92 Diluted net income per share $ 0.38 $ 0.30 $ 0.90 $ 0.92 1 2 . Segment Information Financial results for the Company's reportable segments have been prepared using a management approach, which is consistent with the basis and manner in which financial information is evaluated by the Company's chief operating decision maker in allocating resources and in assessing performance. The Company’s chief operating decision maker, the Chief Executive Officer, evaluates the performance of the Company’s segments primarily based on net sales, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (“EBITDA”) and operating assets. The Company operates in two reportable segments: (i) U.S. Factory-built Housing, which includes manufacturing and retail housing operations and (ii) Canadian Factory-built Housing. Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation operations, corporate costs directly incurred for all segments and intersegment eliminations. Segments are generally determined by geography. Segment data includes intersegment revenues and corporate office costs that are directly and exclusively incurred for each segment. Total assets for Corporate/Other primarily includes cash and certain deferred tax items not specifically allocated to another segment. 12 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued Selected financial information by reportable segment was as follows: Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) December 26, 2020 December 28, 2019 December 26, 2020 December 28, 2019 Net sales: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 336,358 $ 304,818 $ 868,577 $ 949,253 Canadian Factory-built Housing 26,351 22,809 66,104 72,916 Corporate/Other 14,872 14,612 38,551 46,416 Consolidated net sales $ 377,581 $ 342,239 $ 973,232 $ 1,068,585 Operating income: U.S. Factory-built Housing EBITDA $ 35,538 $ 33,165 $ 88,628 $ 104,624 Canadian Factory-built Housing EBITDA 2,933 1,786 13,790 9,085 Corporate/Other EBITDA ( 6,407 ) ( 6,771 ) ( 20,235 ) ( 26,177 ) Other income ( 180 ) — ( 6,993 ) — Depreciation ( 3,025 ) ( 3,171 ) ( 8,994 ) ( 9,826 ) Amortization ( 1,361 ) ( 1,345 ) ( 4,082 ) ( 4,069 ) Consolidated operating income $ 27,498 $ 23,664 $ 62,114 $ 73,637 Depreciation: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 2,378 $ 2,659 $ 7,167 $ 8,365 Canadian Factory-built Housing 246 255 609 744 Corporate/Other 401 257 1,218 717 Consolidated depreciation $ 3,025 $ 3,171 $ 8,994 $ 9,826 Amortization of intangible assets: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 1,361 $ 1,345 $ 4,082 $ 4,069 Canadian Factory-built Housing — — — — Corporate/Other — — — — Consolidated amortization of intangible assets $ 1,361 $ 1,345 $ 4,082 $ 4,069 Capital expenditures: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 1,234 $ 1,981 $ 3,173 $ 9,483 Canadian Factory-built Housing 312 414 554 842 Corporate/Other 137 306 508 1,785 Consolidated capital expenditures $ 1,683 $ 2,701 $ 4,235 $ 12,110 (Dollars in thousands) December 26, 2020 March 28, 2020 Total Assets: U.S. Factory-built Housing (1) $ 482,043 $ 491,110 Canadian Factory-built Housing (1) 77,113 56,760 Corporate/Other (1) 266,709 233,830 Consolidated total assets $ 825,865 $ 781,700 (1) Deferred tax assets for the Canadian operations are reflected in the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment.

Commitments, Contingencies and Legal Proceedings Repurchase Contingencies and Guarantees The Company is contingently liable under terms of repurchase agreements with lending institutions that provide wholesale floor plan financing to retailers. These arrangements, which are customary in the manufactured housing industry, provide for the repurchase of products sold to retailers in the event of default by the retailer on their agreement to pay the financial institution. The risk of loss from these agreements is spread over numerous retailers. The repurchase price is generally determined by the original sales price of the product less contractually defined curtailment payments. Excluding the resale value of the homes, the contingent repurchase obligation as of December 26, 2020 was estimated to be $ 148.8 million. The Company accounts for the guarantees under its repurchase agreements with the retailers’ financing 13 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued institutions by estimating and deferring a portion of the related product sale that represents the estimated fair value of the repurchase obligation. In addition, the Company has estimated the expected contingent net loss the Company will incur upon resale of any repurchases. Th ese estimate s are based on recent historical experience supplemented by management’s assessment of current economic and other conditions affecting retailers for which the Company has a contingent repurchase obligation . Based on these repurchase agreement s and historical loss experience , as well as current economic conditions and forecasts that affect the potential loss exposure, a loss reserve of $ 0.9 million and $ 1.0 million was recorded as of December 26, 2020 and March 28, 2020 , respectively . Losses incurred on homes repurchased were not significant durin g the three or nine month periods end ed December 26, 2020 or December 28, 2019 . At December 26, 2020 , the Company was contingently obligated for $ 33.9 million under letters of credit, primarily consisting of $ 12.6 million to support long-term debt, $ 21.0 million to support the casualty insurance program, and $ 0.3 million to support bonding agreements. The letters of credit are issued from a sub-facility of the Credit Agreement. The Company was also contingently obligated for $ 34.3 million under surety bonds, generally to support performance on long-term construction contracts and license and service bonding requirements. In the normal course of business, the Company’s former subsidiaries that operated in the United Kingdom historically provided certain guarantees to two customers. Those guarantees provide contractual liability for proven construction defects up to 12 years from the date of delivery of certain products. The guarantees remain a contingent liability of the Company which declines over time through October 2027. As of the date of this report, the Company expects few, if any, claims to be reported under the terms of the guarantees. Legal Proceedings The Company has agreed to indemnify counterparties in the ordinary course of its business in agreements to acquire and sell business assets and in financing arrangements. The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of its business. As of the date of this filing, the Company believes the ultimate liability with respect to these contingent obligations will not have, either individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 14 Item 2. MANAGEMENT’ S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following should be read in conjunction with Skyline Champion Corporation’s condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear in Item 1 of this Report. Overview Skyline Champion Corporation (the “Company”) is a leading producer of factory-built housing in the U.S. and Canada. The Company serves as a complete solutions provider across complementary and vertically integrated businesses including manufactured offsite construction, company-owned retail locations, and transportation logistics services. The Company is the largest independent publicly traded factory-built solutions provider in North America (based on revenue) and markets its homes under several nationally recognized brand names including Skyline Homes, Champion Home Builders, Genesis Homes, Athens Park Models, Dutch Housing, Excel Homes, Homes of Merit, New Era, Redman Homes, Shore Park, Silvercrest, Titan Homes in the U.S., and Moduline and SRI Homes in western Canada. The Company operates 33 manufacturing facilities throughout the U.S. and five manufacturing facilities in western Canada that primarily construct factory-built, timber-framed, manufactured and modular houses that are sold primarily to independent retailers, builders/developers, and manufactured home community operators. The Company’s retail operations consist of 18 sales centers that sell manufactured homes to consumers primarily in the southern U.S. The Company’s transportation business engages independent owners/drivers to transport manufactured homes and recreational vehicles and other products throughout the U.S. and Canada. Industry and Company Outlook In recent years, manufactured home construction experienced revenue growth due to a number of favorable demographic trends and demand drivers in the United States, including underlying growth trends in key homebuyer groups, such as the population over 65 years of age, the population of first-time home buyers, and the population of households earning less than $50,000 per year. More recently, we see a number of market trends pointing to increased sales of Alternative Dwelling Units (“ADUs”) and urban-to-rural migration as customers accommodate working-from-home patterns, as well as people seeking rent-to-own single-family options. We intend to capitalize on these trends and drivers to grow our business over the medium-to-long-term. We believe that there is an opportunity for continued manufactured and modular construction market expansion driven by the foregoing trends and demand drivers, as well as construction labor shortages in certain regions (which tend to adversely and disproportionally impact supply and cost of site-built homes when compared to manufactured housing) and increased affordability of factory-built homes relative to site-built homes. For the nine months ended December 26, 2020 , approximately 77% of the Company’s U.S. manufacturing sales were generated from the manufacture of homes that comply with the Federal HUD-code construction standard in the U.S. Industry shipments of HUD-code homes were 86,769 during the eleven months ended November 30, 2020 compared to 87,897 units shipped in same period of the prior year. The Company’s HUD market share during the eleven-month period ended November 30, 2020 was 15.7% versus 17.1% in the comparable period of the prior year. Annual industry shipments have generally increased each calendar year since 2009 when only 50,000 HUD code manufactured homes were shipped, the lowest level since the industry began recording statistics in 1959. While shipments of HUD code manufactured homes have improved modestly in recent years, manufactured housing’s most recent annual shipment levels still operate at lower levels than the long-term historical average of over 200,000 units annually. For the nine months ended December 26, 2020 , approximately 17% of the Company’s U.S. manufacturing sales were modular. The industry historically reported U.S. modular market shipments quarterly and three months in arrears. However, reporting of industry shipment data is unavailable, and is expected to remain unavailable for the foreseeable future. Industry shipments of modular homes in the U.S. were 14,690 in calendar year 2019. The Company’s modular market share during this period was 13.9%. COVID-19 Pandemic The outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (""COVID-19"") was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. There remains continued uncertainty regarding the extent and duration of the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on the economy, the housing market, and the Company, as well as the Company’s employees, customers, and suppliers. The Company has prioritized the safety and well-being of its employees and customers and has implemented standards to operate in accordance with social-distancing protocols and public health authority guidelines. Beginning in March 2020, the Company took actions to temporarily idle certain facilities in response to government shutdown orders or reduced demand. By late April 2020, most of the temporarily idled manufacturing facilities had reopened, but at reduced production levels due to employee absenteeism, difficulty hiring new team members and social distancing protocols. As of December 26, 2020, only one manufacturing facility remained temporarily idled due to labor availability constraints. During the second and third quarters of fiscal 2021, the Company experienced intermittent closures due to COVID-19 outbreaks at the facilities or surrounding communities causing higher than normal absenteeism. In the third quarter of fiscal 2021, the Company was able to increase daily production rates over the levels achieved in the prior year period as direct labor staffing levels increased and production efficiencies improved. As of December 26, 2020, availability of labor and certain materials have improved compared to earlier in fiscal 2021, but remain subject to disruption and uncertainty. Prices for key raw materials have experienced increased volatility and, overall, manufacturing costs have trended higher than prior periods. 15 Since the start of the fiscal year, the Company’s retail operations have adjusted their operating procedures to comply with local and state mandates; and have generally remained open but have shifted physical visits to a larger on-line presence. The Company consolidated its retail footprint by closing three retail sales centers during the second quarter of fiscal 2021 in an effort to optimize costs while taking advantage of an increase in distribution through digital marketing efforts. We have strong local independent retailers to serve customers in those areas . In response to the pandemic, the Company offered extended benefits to employees, including increased sick pay and waived premium payments on healthcare benefits for furloughed employees. The Company’s U.S. operations incurred $2.2 million of expense related to those extended benefits. Various government programs have been announced to provide financial relief for affected businesses, including the Employee Retention Credit under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (""CARES Act"") and state level programs in the United States and the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (""CEWS"") under the COVID-19 Economic Response Plan in Canada. CEWS provides a cash subsidy of up to 75% of eligible employees’ remuneration, subject to certain criteria. The Company recognized $6.2 million for payroll subsidies under CEWS during the nine months ended December 26, 2020. No payroll subsidy was recognized under CEWS during the three months ended December 26, 2020. The Company also recognized $0.2 million and $0.8 million during the three and nine months ended December 26, 2020 for wage subsidies under the CARES Act and other state level programs in the United States. In addition, the CARES Act allows for deferring payment of certain payroll taxes. Through December 26, 2020, the Company has deferred $11.6 million of payroll taxes that will be paid beginning in December 2021.

Net sales for the three months ended December 26, 2020 were $377.6 million, an increase of $35.3 million, or 10.3% over the three months ended December 28, 2019. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. U.S. Factory-built Housing: Net sales for the Company’s U.S. manufacturing and retail operations increased by $31.5 million, or 10.3%. The increase was due to an increase in the number of homes sold of 6.2% and an increase in average home selling price of 4.0%. The increase in the number of homes sold is due to strong demand which has resulted in increased production levels at many of Company’s manufacturing locations. The average selling price increased due to pricing actions enacted in response to rising material costs, partially offset by a shift in product mix. Product mix fluctuations result from consumer preferences regarding the sizes and styles of homes selected for purchase, options and upgrade packages, as well as regional housing dynamics. Canadian Factory-built Housing: The Canadian Factory-built Housing segment net sales increased by $3.5 million, or 15.5% for the three months ended December 26, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a 15.2% increase in the number of homes sold and an increase of 0.4% in the average home selling price. The increase in the number of homes sold is due to stronger demand compared to the same period last year which has resulted in increased production levels at the Company’s Canadian manufacturing locations. On a constant currency basis, net sales for the Canadian segment were unfavorably impacted by approximately $0.1 million due to fluctuations in the translation of Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar during the third quarter of fiscal 2021 as compared to the same period of the prior year. Corporate/Other: Net sales for Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation business and the elimination of intersegment sales. For the three months ended December 26, 2020, net sales increased $0.3 million, or 1.8%. The increase was primarily attributable to higher net sales in the Company’s transportation business from increased manufactured home and RV shipments. GROSS PROFIT The following table summarizes gross profit for the three months ended December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019 : Three Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) December 26, 2020 December 28, 2019 $ Change % Change Gross profit: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 62,943 $ 61,200 $ 1,743 2.8 % Canadian Factory-built Housing 5,372 4,512 860 19.1 % Corporate/Other 3,469 3,189 280 8.8 % Total gross profit $ 71,784 $ 68,901 $ 2,883 4.2 % Gross profit as a percent of net sales 19.0 % 20.1 % 17 Gross profit as a percent of sales during the three months ended December 26, 2020 was 19.0% compared to 20.1% during the three months ended December 28, 2019. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. U.S. Factory-built Housing: Gross profit for the U.S. Factory-built Housing segment increased by $1.7 million, or 2.8%, during the three months ended December 26, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to increased sales volume. Gross profit as a percent of segment net sales was 18.7% for the three months ended December 26, 2020 compared to 20.1% in the same period of the prior year primarily due to increased material costs caused by market volatility in certain commodities including forest products, partially offset by direct labor efficiencies and increased leverage of fixed costs caused by higher sales volumes. Canadian Factory-built Housing: Gross profit for the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment increased by $0.9 million, or 19.1% during the three months ended December 26, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year. Gross profit as a percent of net sales was 20.4% for the three months ended December 26, 2020, compared to 19.8% in the same period of the prior year. The increase is primarily due to higher sales volume, as well as pricing actions taken to offset material cost inflation. Corporate/Other: Gross profit for the Corporate/Other segment increased $0.3 million, or 8.8%, during the three months ended December 26, 2020 compared to the same period of the prior year, primarily due to changes in revenue mix. SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Selling, general, and administrative expenses include foreign currency transaction gains and losses, equity compensation, and intangible amortization expense. The following table summarizes selling, general, and administrative expenses for the three months ended December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019: Three Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) December 26, 2020 December 28, 2019 $ Change % Change Selling, general, and administrative expenses: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 31,324 $ 32,039 $ (715 ) (2.2 %) Canadian Factory-built Housing 2,682 2,980 (298 ) (10.0 %) Corporate/Other 10,280 10,218 62 0.6 % Total selling, general, and administrative expenses $ 44,286 $ 45,237 $ (951 ) (2.1 %) Selling, general, and administrative expense as a percent of net sales 11.7 % 13.2 % Selling, general, and administrative expenses were $44.3 million for the three months ended December 26, 2020, a decrease of $1.0 million compared to the same period in the prior year. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. U.S. Factory-built Housing: Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the U.S. Factory-built Housing segment decreased $0.7 million, or 2.2%, during the three months ended December 26, 2020 as compared to the same period in the prior year. As a percent of segment net sales, selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased to 9.3% for the three months ended December 26, 2020 compared to 10.5% during the comparable period of the prior year. The decrease resulted from a reduction in costs for travel and marketing-related expenses partially offset by increased sales commissions and incentive compensation, which is generally based on sales volume or a measure of profitability. Canadian Factory-built Housing: Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment decreased $0.3, or 10.0%, million for three months ended December 26, 2020 when compared to the same period of the prior year. As a percent of segment net sales, selling, general, and administrative expenses for the Canadian segment was 10.2% and 13.1% for the three months ended December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, respectively. The decrease as a percentage of net sales was a result of increased leverage of fixed costs due to increased sales volumes. Corporate/Other: Selling, general, and administrative expenses for Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation operations, corporate costs incurred for all segments, and intersegment eliminations. Selling, general, and administrative expenses for Corporate/Other increased $0.1 18 million , or 0.6%, during the three months ended December 26, 2020 as compared to the same period of the prior year. Increases in professional fees and other administrative costs were mostly offset by a reduction in equity compensation expense and integration costs from the 2018 combination of Skyline Corporation and the operating assets of Champion Enterprises Holding, LLC (the “2018 Combination”). INTEREST EXPENSE, NET The following table summarizes the components of interest expense, net for the three months ended December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019: Three Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) December 26, 2020 December 28, 2019 $ Change % Change Interest expense $ 946 $ 1,111 $ (165 ) (14.9 %) Less: Interest income 151 783 (632 ) (80.7 %) Interest expense, net $ 795 $ 328 $ 467 142.4 % Average outstanding floor plan payable $ 24,304 $ 32,178 Average outstanding long-term debt $ 64,663 $ 42,663 Interest expense, net was $0.8 million for the three months ended December 26, 2020, an increase of $0.5 million compared to the same period of the prior year. The net increase in expense was due to a reduction in interest income earned on the Company’s cash balances invested in short-term facilities and reduced interest expense on the Company’s borrowings, both due to a reduction in interest rates. OTHER INCOME The following table summarizes other income for the three months ended December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019: Three Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) December 26, 2020 December 28, 2019 $ Change % Change Other income $ (180 ) $ — $ (180 ) 100.0 % Other income for the three months ended December 26, 2020 related to payroll tax subsidies provided by certain U.S. government sponsored financial assistance programs enacted in response to the pandemic. INCOME TAX EXPENSE The following table summarizes income tax expense for the three months ended December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019: Three Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) December 26, 2020 December 28, 2019 $ Change % Change Income tax expense $ 5,284 $ 6,299 $ (1,015 ) (16.1 %) Effective tax rate 19.7 % 27.0 % Income tax expense for the three months ended December 26, 2020 was $5.3 million, representing an effective tax rate of 19.7%, compared to income tax expense of $6.3 million, representing an effective tax rate of 27.0%, for the three months ended December 28, 2019. During the third quarter of fiscal 2021, the Company completed a U.S. R&D tax credit study for the years 2018 and 2019 that resulted in recognition of a tax benefit of $1.7 million. The change in the effective tax rate for the three months ended December 26, 2020 compared with the same period of the prior year, was primarily due to an increase in tax credits, certain U.S. tax law changes and results in foreign jurisdictions. The Company’s effective tax rate for both the three months ended December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019 differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of 21.0%, due primarily to the effect of non-deductible expenses, state and local income taxes, tax credits, and results in foreign jurisdictions. ADJUSTED EBITDA The following table reconciles net income, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, to Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the three months ended December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019: 19 Three Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) December 26, 2020 December 28, 2019 $ Change % Change Net income $ 21,599 $ 17,037 $ 4,562 26.8 % Income tax expense 5,284 6,299 (1,015 ) (16.1 %) Interest expense, net 795 328 467 * Depreciation and amortization 4,386 4,516 (130 ) (2.9 %) Equity-based compensation (for awards granted prior to December 31, 2018) — 965 (965 ) * Acquisition integration costs — 560 (560 ) * Other — 40 (40 ) * Adjusted EBITDA $ 32,064 $ 29,745 $ 2,319 7.8 % * indicates that the calculated percentage is not meaningful Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended December 26, 2020 was $32.1 million, an increase of $2.3 million from the same period of the prior year. The increase is primarily a result of higher operating income after adjusting for the effect of integration costs and equity-based compensation incurred in the prior year. The increase in operating income is primarily due to increased sales volume. See the definition of Adjusted EBITDA below for additional information regarding the definition and use of this metric. 20 UNAUDITED INCOME STATEMENTS FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2021 VS. 2020 Nine Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) December 26, 2020 December 28, 2019 Results of Operations Data: Net sales $ 973,232 $ 1,068,585 Cost of sales 784,652 849,594 Gross profit 188,580 218,991 Selling, general, and administrative expenses 126,466 145,354 Operating income 62,114 73,637 Interest expense, net 2,601 1,019 Other income (6,993 ) — Income before income taxes 66,506 72,618 Income tax expense 15,493 20,456 Net income $ 51,013 $ 52,162 Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA: Net income $ 51,013 $ 52,162 Income tax expense 15,493 20,456 Interest expense, net 2,601 1,019 Depreciation and amortization 13,076 13,895 Equity-based compensation (for awards granted prior to December 31, 2018) 1,358 3,606 Acquisition integration costs — 1,938 Fair market value adjustment for asset classified as held for sale — 986 Other — 250 Adjusted EBITDA $ 83,541 $ 94,312 As a percent of net sales: Gross profit 19.4 % 20.5 % Selling, general, and administrative expenses 13.0 % 13.6 % Operating income 6.4 % 6.9 % Net income 5.2 % 4.9 % Adjusted EBITDA 8.6 % 8.8 % NET SALES The following table summarizes net sales for the nine months ended December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019: Nine Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) December 26, 2020 December 28, 2019 $ Change % Change Net sales $ 973,232 $ 1,068,585 $ (95,353 ) (8.9 %) U.S. manufacturing and retail net sales $ 868,577 $ 949,253 $ (80,676 ) (8.5 %) U.S. homes sold 14,060 15,507 (1,447 ) (9.3 %) U.S. manufacturing and retail average home selling price $ 61.8 $ 61.2 $ 0.6 1.0 % Canadian manufacturing net sales $ 66,104 $ 72,916 $ (6,812 ) (9.3 %) Canadian homes sold 812 872 (60 ) (6.9 %) Canadian manufacturing average home selling price $ 81.4 $ 83.6 $ (2.2 ) (2.6 %) Corporate/Other net sales $ 38,551 $ 46,416 $ (7,865 ) (16.9 %) U.S. manufacturing facilities in operation at end of period* 33 33 U.S. retail sales centers in operation at end of period 18 21 Canadian manufacturing facilities in operation at end of period 5 5 *One of the Company’s manufacturing facilities is temporarily idled as of December 26, 2020, but still considered operational. Net sales for the nine months ended December 26, 2020 were $973.2 million, a decrease of $95.4 million, or 8.9% over the nine months ended December 28, 2019. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. 21 U.S. Factory-built Housing: Net sales for the Company’s U.S. manufacturing and retail operations decreased by $80.7 million, or 8.5%. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the number of homes sold during the nine months ended December 26, 2020 of 9.3%, partially offset by an increase in the average home selling price of 1.0%. U.S. housing sales volumes were severely impacted by COVID-19-related factors in the first few months of the fiscal year. Production facilities operated at reduced levels as compared to the prior year due to employee hiring constraints, social-distancing protocols and, in some areas, reduced demand. Production and demand levels began to return to more normal pre-COVID-19 levels during the second quarter and production levels have continued to increase during the third quarter. The average home selling price increased due to a shift in product mix versus the same period last year. Canadian Factory-built Housing: The Canadian Factory-built Housing segment net sales decreased by $6.8 million, or 9.3% for the nine months ended December 26, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a 6.9% decrease in the number of homes sold, coupled with a 2.6% decrease in average home selling price. The decrease in volume was due to reduced demand and production primarily from oil-related demand drivers and the impacts of COVID-19 for first few months of the fiscal year. Production and demand levels began to return to more normal pre-COVID-19 levels during the second quarter and production levels have continued to increase during the third quarter. The decrease in average selling price is due to a shift in product mix. On a constant currency basis, net sales for the Canadian segment were unfavorably impacted by approximately $0.9 million due to fluctuations in the translation of Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar during the first nine months of fiscal 2021 as compared to the same period of the prior year. Corporate/Other: Net sales for Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation business and the elimination of intersegment sales. For the nine months ended December 26, 2020, net sales decreased $7.9 million, or 16.9%. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower net sales as a result of lower shipments caused by COVID-19-related manufacturing shutdowns in both the RV and manufactured housing industries experienced mainly in the U.S. Midwest and Northeast regions in the first few months of the fiscal year. As production in the RV and manufactured housing industries started to normalize to pre-COVID-19 levels, shipments of these products also started to increase during the second and third quarters of fiscal 2021. GROSS PROFIT The following table summarizes gross profit for the nine months ended December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019: Nine Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) December 26, 2020 December 28, 2019 $ Change % Change Gross profit: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 165,899 $ 194,876 $ (28,977 ) (14.9 %) Canadian Factory-built Housing 12,941 15,091 (2,150 ) (14.2 %) Corporate/Other 9,740 9,024 716 7.9 % Total gross profit $ 188,580 $ 218,991 $ (30,411 ) (13.9 %) Gross profit as a percent of net sales 19.4 % 20.5 % Gross profit as a percent of sales during the nine months ended December 26, 2020 was 19.4% compared to 20.5% during the nine months ended December 28, 2019 . The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. U.S. Factory-built Housing: Gross profit for the U.S. Factory-built Housing segment decreased by $29.0 million, or 14.9%, during the nine months ended December 26, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year. Gross profit was 19.1% as a percent of segment net sales for the nine months ended December 26, 2020 compared to 20.5% in the same period of the prior year. The decrease in gross profit is due to increased material costs from market volatility in certain commodities, primarily forest products, reduced leverage of manufacturing fixed costs caused by reduced sales volumes, as well as the supplemental COVID-19-related sick pay and health benefits provided to employees totaling approximately $2.2 million. Canadian Factory-built Housing: Gross profit for the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment decreased by $2.2 million, or 14.2% during the nine months ended December 26, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to lower sales volume. Gross profit as a percent of net sales 22 was 19.6 % for the nine months ended December 26, 2020 , compared to 20.7 % in the same period of the prior year due to increased material costs from market volatility in certain commodities, primarily forest products, and reduced leverage of manufacturing fixed costs caused by reduced sales volumes . Corporate/Other: Gross profit for the Corporate/Other segment increased $0.7 million, or 7.9%, during the nine months ended December 26, 2020 compared to the same period of the prior year, primarily due to increased net sales in the Company’s transportation operations. Gross profit improved as a percent of segment net sales to 25.3% from 19.4% as a result of changes in revenue mix and expansion of storage offerings. SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Selling, general, and administrative expenses include foreign currency transaction gains and losses, equity compensation, and intangible amortization expense. The following table summarizes selling, general, and administrative expenses for the nine months ended December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019: Nine Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) December 26, 2020 December 28, 2019 $ Change % Change Selling, general, and administrative expenses: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 89,301 $ 102,686 $ (13,385 ) (13.0 %) Canadian Factory-built Housing 5,971 6,749 (778 ) (11.5 %) Corporate/Other 31,194 35,919 (4,725 ) (13.2 %) Total selling, general, and administrative expenses $ 126,466 $ 145,354 $ (18,888 ) (13.0 %) Selling, general, and administrative expense as a percent of net sales 13.0 % 13.6 % Selling, general, and administrative expenses were $126.5 million for the nine months ended December 26, 2020 , a decrease of $18.9 million compared to the same period in the prior year. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. U.S. Factory-built Housing: Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the U.S. Factory-built Housing segment decreased $13.4 million, or 13.0%, during the nine months ended December 26, 2020 as compared to the same period in the prior year. Selling, general, and administrative expenses, as a percent of segment net sales decreased to 10.3% for the nine months ended December 26, 2020 compared to 10.8% during the comparable period of the prior year. The decrease in selling, general, and administrative expenses resulted from a combination of factors which include: (i) a reduction in travel and trade show expenses; (ii) lower sales commissions and incentive compensation, which is generally based on sales volume or a measure of profitability; and (iii) lower wage expense from headcount reductions and furloughs in response to COVID-19. Canadian Factory-built Housing: Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment decreased $0.8 million, or 11.5%, for the nine months ended December 26, 2020 when compared to the same period of the prior year. Selling, general, and administrative expenses, as a percent of segment net sales decreased to 9.0% for the nine months ended December 26, 2020 compared to 9.3% during the comparable period of the prior year. The decrease in selling, general, and administrative expenses resulted from a reduction in travel and other administrative costs, as well as lower wage expense from headcount reductions and furloughs in response to COVID-19. Corporate/Other: Selling, general, and administrative expenses for Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation operations, corporate costs incurred for all segments, and intersegment eliminations. Selling, general, and administrative expenses for Corporate/Other decreased $4.7 million, or 13.2%, during the nine months ended December 26, 2020 as compared to the same period of the prior year. The decrease is due to a reduction in equity compensation costs, incentive and travel expenses as well as no longer incurring costs related to integration activities from the 2018 Combination, and a fair value adjustment of an asset classified as held for sale recorded in the prior year. 23 INTEREST EXPENSE , NET The following table summarizes the components of interest expense, net for the nine months ended December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019: Nine Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) December 26, 2020 December 28, 2019 $ Change % Change Interest expense $ 3,007 $ 3,577 $ (570 ) (15.9 %) Less: Interest income 406 2,558 (2,152 ) (84.1 %) Interest expense, net $ 2,601 $ 1,019 $ 1,582 155.3 % Average outstanding floor plan payable $ 27,560 $ 31,880 Average outstanding long-term debt $ 73,108 $ 47,663 Interest expense, net was $2.6 million for the nine months ended December 26, 2020 , an increase of $1.6 million compared to the same period of the prior year. The net increase in expense was primarily due to higher average revolver balances combined with a reduction of interest income earned on the Company’s cash balances invested in short-term facilities and reduced interest expense on the Company’s borrowings, both due to a reduction in interest rates. OTHER INCOME The following table summarizes other income for the nine months ended December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019: Nine Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) December 26, 2020 December 28, 2019 $ Change % Change Other income $ (6,993 ) $ — $ (6,993 ) 100.0 % Other income for the nine months ended December 26, 2020 was $7.0 million which was a result of wage subsidies provided by government sponsored financial assistance programs that were enacted in responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. The programs included a Canadian wage subsidy benefit of $6.2 million and U.S. federal and state wage subsidy benefits of $0.8 million. INCOME TAX EXPENSE The following table summarizes income tax expense for the nine months ended December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019: Nine Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) December 26, 2020 December 28, 2019 $ Change % Change Income tax expense $ 15,493 $ 20,456 $ (4,963 ) (24.3 %) Effective tax rate 23.3 % 28.2 % Income tax expense for the nine months ended December 26, 2020 was $15.5 million, representing an effective tax rate of 23.3%, compared to income tax expense of $20.5 million, representing an effective tax rate of 28.2% for the nine months ended December 28, 2019. During the third quarter of fiscal 2021, the Company completed a U.S. R&D tax credit study for the years 2018 and 2019 that resulted in recognition of a tax benefit of $1.7 million. The change in the effective tax rate for the nine months ended December 26, 2020 compared with the same respective period of the prior year was primarily due to an increase in tax credits, certain U.S. tax law changes and results in foreign jurisdictions. The Company’s effective tax rate for the nine months ended December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019 differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of 21.0%, due primarily to the effect of non-deductible expenses, state and local income taxes, tax credits, and results in foreign jurisdictions. 24 ADJUSTED EBITDA The following table reconciles net income, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, to Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the nine months ended December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019: Nine Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) December 26, 2020 December 28, 2019 $ Change % Change Net income $ 51,013 $ 52,162 $ (1,149 ) (2.2 %) Income tax expense 15,493 20,456 (4,963 ) (24.3 %) Interest expense, net 2,601 1,019 1,582 * Depreciation and amortization 13,076 13,895 (819 ) (5.9 %) Equity-based compensation (for awards granted prior to December 31, 2018) 1,358 3,606 (2,248 ) (62.3 %) Acquisition integration costs — 1,938 (1,938 ) * Fair market value adjustment for asset classified as held for sale — 986 (986 ) * Other — 250 (250 ) * Adjusted EBITDA $ 83,541 $ 94,312 $ (10,771 ) (11.4 %) * indicates that the calculated percentage is not meaningful Adjusted EBITDA for the nine months ended December 26, 2020 was $83.5 million, a decrease of $10.8 million from the same period of the prior year. The decrease is primarily a result of lower operating income after adjusting for the effects of integration costs and the fair market value adjustment for an asset classified as held for sale incurred in the prior year. The decrease in operating income is primarily due to a decrease in sales volume and a decrease in gross margin, partially offset by lower SG&A expenses. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss plus: (a) the provision for income taxes; (b) interest expense, net; (c) depreciation and amortization; (d) gain or loss from discontinued operations; (e) equity-based compensation awards granted prior to December 31, 2018; (f) restructuring charges; (g) impairment of assets; and (h) other non-operating costs including those for the acquisition and integration or disposition of businesses and idle facilities. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of earnings calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income or loss, net sales, operating income, or earnings per share prepared on a U.S. GAAP basis. The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA is commonly used by investors to evaluate its performance and that of its competitors. However, the Company’s use of Adjusted EBITDA may vary from that of others in its industry. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, investors should be aware that, in the future, the Company may incur expenses similar to those adjusted for in this presentation. This presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an implication that the Company’s future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items. Adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are: Adjusted EBITDA: • does not reflect the interest expense on our debt; • excludes impairments; and • does not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; • although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and • other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. Given these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our U.S. GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures only on a supplemental basis. BACKLOG Although orders from customers can be cancelled at any time without penalty, and unfilled orders are not necessarily an indication of future business, the Company’s unfilled U.S. and Canadian manufacturing orders at December 26, 2020 totaled $488.5 million compared to $133.1 million at December 28, 2019. The increase in backlog is driven by increased demand for single-family homes which has resulted in order levels that have significantly outpaced production in both the U.S. and Canada. Production levels vary widely by plant, but have, on 25 average, surpassed last year’s average production rates throughout the third quarter of fiscal 2021 . Increasing production rates to keep pace with orders is limited by individual plant capacity, time to train new employees, employee attendance and accessibility of materials. Production may also be limited by additional instances of COVID-19 related impacts, including intermittent facility shutdowns . Liquidity and Capital Resources Sources and Uses of Cash The following table presents summary cash flow information for the nine months ended December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019: Nine Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) December 26, 2020 December 28, 2019 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 103,816 $ 73,077 Investing activities (1,213 ) (10,966 ) Financing activities (47,938 ) (17,968 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents 2,940 510 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents 57,605 44,653 Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period 209,455 126,634 Cash and cash equivalents at end of period $ 267,060 $ 171,287 The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and existing cash balances. Cash balances and cash flow from operations for the next year are expected to be adequate to cover working capital requirements, capital expenditures, and debt payment obligations. The Company does not have any scheduled long-term debt maturities in the next twelve months. The Company’s revolving credit facility includes a leverage ratio covenant that requires the Company’s first lien debt levels to remain less than 2.75 times of the consolidated trailing twelve-month EBITDA. The Company anticipates compliance with its debt covenants and projects its level of cash availability to be in excess of cash needed to operate the business for the next year. In the event operating cash flow and existing cash balances were deemed inadequate to support the Company’s liquidity needs, and one or more capital resources were to become unavailable, the Company would revise operating strategies accordingly. Cash provided by operating activities was $103.8 million during the nine months ended December 26, 2020 compared to $73.1 million during the nine months ended December 28, 2019. The increase of $30.7 million in cash from operating activities is primarily due to increased deposits from customers, deferral of certain payroll tax obligations resulting from the CARES Act regulations, and the benefit of the CEWS subsidy received, partially offset by slightly lower net income compared to the same period of the prior year. Cash used in investing activities was $1.2 million for the nine months ended December 26, 2020 compared to $11.0 million during the nine months ended December 28, 2019. The decrease in cash used for investing activities is primarily related to a decrease in capital expenditures in the current period which is primarily due to deferral of non-essential spending as well as non -recurring spending incurred in the prior year related to: (i) expansion of production capacity at the Leesville, Louisiana manufacturing facility; and (ii) investment in equipment to facilitate improvement in safety and operating efficiencies. In addition, the Company received $1.2 million of proceeds from the maturity of a Company owned life insurance policy and $1.8 million of proceeds from the sale of fixed assets during fiscal 2021. The Company received proceeds of $1.1 million from the disposition of a held for sale property in fiscal 2020. Cash used in financing activities was $47.9 million for the nine months ended December 26, 2020 compared to $18.0 million during the nine months ended December 28, 2019. Cash used in financing activities during the first nine months of fiscal 2021 was related to a $38.0 million repayment on the revolving credit facility, net repayments of the floor plan payable balance of $8.3 million and payments for remittance of employee taxes associated with share-based compensation programs of $1.7 million. Cash used in financing activities during the first nine months of fiscal 2020 was primarily related to $15.0 million of repayments on the revolving credit facility, a $2.1 million payment for remittance of employee taxes associated with share-based compensation programs and a $0.9 million net repayment of the floor plan payable balance.

See accompanying Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 5 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 1. Basis of Presentation and Business Nature of Operations: Skyline Champion Corporation (the “Company”) is a leading producer of factory-built housing in the United States (“U.S.”) and Canada. The Company’s operations consist of manufacturing, retail, and transportation activities. The Company operates 33 manufacturing facilities throughout the U.S. and five manufacturing facilities in western Canada. These facilities primarily construct factory-built, timber-framed manufactured, and modular houses that are sold primarily to independent retailers, builders/developers, and manufactured home community operators. The Company’s retail operations consist of 18 sales centers that sell manufactured houses to consumers primarily in the Southern U.S. The Company’s transportation business engages independent owners/drivers to transport manufactured homes, recreational vehicles and other products throughout the U.S. and Canada. COVID-19 Government Financial Assistance: The outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (""COVID-19"") was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. Various government programs have been announced which provide financial relief for affected businesses including the Employee Retention Credit under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (""CARES Act"") in the United States, and the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (""CEWS"") under the COVID-19 Economic Response Plan in Canada. During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, the Company recognized CARES Act subsidies of $ 0.6 million. In addition, the CARES Act allows for deferring payment of certain payroll taxes. Through September 26, 2020, the Company has deferred $ 7.4 million of payroll taxes that will be paid beginning in December 2021. In Canada, the Company recognized $ 2.6 million and $ 6.2 million of payroll subsidies under CEWS during the three and six months ended September 26, 2020, respectively. The Company’s policy is to account for these subsidies as Other Income in the period in which the related costs are incurred and the Company is reasonably assured to receive payment. As of September 26, 2020, the Company had received $ 5.6 million of the CEWS subsidies. Basis of Presentation: The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) for Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Article 10 of SEC Regulation S-X. Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“U.S. GAAP”) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany balances and transactions. In the opinion of management, these statements include all normal recurring adjustments necessary to fairly state the Company’s consolidated results of operations, cash flows, and financial position. The Company has evaluated subsequent events after the balance sheet date through the date of the filing of this report with the SEC. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the SEC on May 21, 2020 (the “Fiscal 2020 Annual Report”). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The condensed consolidated income statements, condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income, and condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations or cash flows for the full year. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation. The Company’s fiscal year is a 52- or 53-week period that ends on the Saturday nearest to March 31. The Company’s current fiscal year, “fiscal 2021,” will end on April 3, 2021 and will include 53 weeks. References to “fiscal 2020” refer to the Company’s fiscal year ended March 28, 2020. The three and six months ended September 26, 2020 and September 28 , 2019 each included 13 weeks and 26 weeks, respectively. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements: On March 29, 2020, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (""ASU"") 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments ,” using a modified retrospective approach. The standard amends several aspects of the measurement of credit losses related to certain financial instruments, including the replacement of the existing incurred credit loss model and other models with the current expected credit losses (""CECL"") model. The cumulative effect of adoption resulted in an increase of $ 0.2 million in the allowance for credit loss and a corresponding decrease in retained earnings as of March 29, 2020. The Company’s allowance for credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost reflects management’s estimate of credit losses over the remaining expected life of such assets, measured primarily using historical experience, as well as current economic conditions and forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. Expected credit losses for newly recognized financial assets, as well as changes to expected credit losses during the period, are recognized in earnings. As of September 26, 2020 and March 28, 2020, accounts receivable are reflected net of reserves of $ 0.3 million and $ 0.4 million, respectively. As of September 26, 2020 and March 28, 2020, other notes receivable are reflected net of reserves of $ 0.4 million and $ 0.5 million, respectively. Changes in expected credit losses were not significant in the first six months of fiscal 2021. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, “ Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350), Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment,” which addresses concerns over the cost and complexity of the two-step impairment testing model, and removes the second step of the test. An entity will apply a one-step quantitative test and record the amount of goodwill impairment as the excess of a reporting unit’s carrying 6 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued amount over its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. The Company adopted the provisions of ASU 2017-04 effective March 29, 2020, and the adoption did not have an impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. There were no other accounting standards recently issued that are expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations. 2 .

The interest rate on borrowings under the Credit Agreement adjusts based on the first lien net leverage of the Company from a high of LIBOR plus 2.25 % and ABR plus 1.25 % when the first lien net leverage is equal to or greater than 2 .00:1.00, to a low of LIBOR plus 1.50 % and ABR plus 0.50 % when the first lien net leverage is below 0.50:1.00. In addition, the Company is obligated to pay an unused line fee ranging between 0.25 % and 0.40 % (depending on the first lien net leverage) in respect of unused commitments under the Credit Agreement. At September 26, 2020 the interest rate on borrowings under the Credit Agreement was 1.70 %. At September 26, 2020 , letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement totaled $ 33.9 million. Total available borrowings under the Credit Agreement as of September 26, 2020 were $ 1.2 million. Obligations under industrial revenue bonds are supported by letters of credit and bear interest based on a municipal bond index rate. The weighted-average interest rate at September 26, 2020, including related costs and fees, was 2.22 %. The industrial revenue bonds require lump-sum payments of principal upon maturity in 2029 . 8 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued The Credit Agreement contains covenants that restrict the amount of additional debt, liens and certain payments, including equity buybacks, investments, dispositions, mergers and consolidations, among other restrictions as defined. The Company was in compliance with all covenants of the Credit Agreement as of September 26, 2020 . Floor Plan Payable The Company’s retail operations utilize floor plan financing to fund the purchase of manufactured homes for display or resale. At September 26, 2020 and March 28, 2020, the Company had outstanding borrowings on floor plan financing agreements of $ 26.6 million and $ 33.9 million, respectively. Total credit line capacity provided under the agreements was $ 49.0 million as of September 26, 2020 . Borrowings are secured by the homes and are required to be repaid when the Company sells the home to a customer. 8 . Revenue Recognition The following tables disaggregate the Company’s revenue by sales category for the three and six months ended September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019 : Three Months Ended September 26, 2020 (Dollars in thousands) U.S. Factory-Built Housing Canadian Factory-Built Housing Corporate/ Other Total Manufacturing and retail $ 275,969 $ 24,558 $ — $ 300,527 Commercial 7,391 — — 7,391 Transportation — — 14,448 14,448 Total $ 283,360 $ 24,558 $ 14,448 $ 322,366 Six Months Ended September 26, 2020 (Dollars in thousands) U.S. Factory-Built Housing Canadian Factory-Built Housing Corporate/ Other Total Manufacturing and retail $ 524,828 $ 39,753 $ — $ 564,581 Commercial 7,391 — — 7,391 Transportation — — 23,679 23,679 Total $ 532,219 $ 39,753 $ 23,679 $ 595,651 Three Months Ended September 28, 2019 (Dollars in thousands) U.S. Factory-Built Housing Canadian Factory-Built Housing Corporate/ Other Total Manufacturing and retail $ 308,299 $ 26,407 $ — $ 334,706 Commercial 4,531 — — 4,531 Transportation — — 15,221 15,221 Total $ 312,830 $ 26,407 $ 15,221 $ 354,458 Six Months Ended September 28, 2019 (Dollars in thousands) U.S. Factory-Built Housing Canadian Factory-Built Housing Corporate/ Other Total Manufacturing and retail $ 639,904 $ 50,107 $ — $ 690,011 Commercial 4,531 — — 4,531 Transportation — — 31,804 31,804 Total $ 644,435 $ 50,107 $ 31,804 $ 726,346 9 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued 9 . Leases The Company has operating leases for land, manufacturing and office facilities, and equipment. The Company's lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such option. The Company's leases do not contain material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease terms. Lease expense included in the accompanying condensed consolidated income statements is shown below: Three Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) September 26, 2020 September 28, 2019 Operating lease expense $ 1,357 $ 1,470 Short-term lease expense 529 230 Total lease expense $ 1,886 $ 1,700 Six Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) September 26, 2020 September 28, 2019 Operating lease expense $ 2,740 $ 2,875 Short-term lease expense 985 603 Total lease expense $ 3,725 $ 3,478 Operating lease assets and obligations included in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets are below: (Dollars in thousands) September 26, 2020 March 28, 2020 Right-of-use assets under operating leases: Other long-term assets $ 12,384 $ 14,808 Lease obligations under operating leases: Other current liabilities $ 4,376 $ 4,789 Other long-term liabilities 8,008 10,019 Total lease obligation $ 12,384 $ 14,808 Maturities of lease obligations as of September 26, 2020, are shown below: (Dollars in thousands) September 26, 2020 Fiscal 2021 (1) $ 2,712 Fiscal 2022 4,743 Fiscal 2023 3,683 Fiscal 2024 1,568 Fiscal 2025 786 Thereafter 1,705 Total undiscounted cash flows 15,197 Less: imputed interest ( 2,813 ) Lease obligations under operating leases $ 12,384 (1) For remaining period in fiscal year. The weighted-average lease term and discount rate for operating leases are shown below: September 26, 2020 Weighted-average remaining lease term (in years) 4.6 Weighted-average discount rate 5.5 The discount rate used to measure a lease obligation should be the rate implicit in the lease; however, the Company’s operating leases generally do not provide an implicit rate. Accordingly, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate at lease commencement to determine the present value of lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is an entity-specific rate, which represents the rate of interest a lessee would pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term with similar payments. 10 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued Cash flow information related to operating leases is shown below: Six Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) September 26, 2020 September 28, 2019 Non-cash activity: Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for operating lease obligations $ 32 $ 1,606 Operating cash flows: Cash paid related to operating lease obligations $ 2,800 $ 2,958 1 0 . Income Taxes For the three months ended September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, the Company recorded $ 5.6 million and $ 7.5 million of income tax expense and had an effective tax rate of 24.4 % and 29.8 %, respectively. For the six months ended September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, the Company recorded $ 10.2 million and $ 14.2 million of income tax expense and had an effective tax rate of 25.8 % and 28.7 %, respectively. The change in the effective tax rate for the three and six months ended September 26, 2020 compared with the same respective periods of the prior year, was primarily due to an increase in tax credits, certain U.S. tax law changes and results in foreign jurisdictions The Company’s effective tax rate for both the three and six months ended September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019 differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of 21.0 % due primarily to the effect of non-deductible expenses, state and local income taxes, tax credits, and results in foreign jurisdictions. At September 26, 2020, the Company had no unrecognized tax benefits. The Company does not anticipate any material changes to uncertain tax benefits in the next twelve months. The Company records interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. 1 1 . Earnings Per Share Basic net income per share (“EPS”) attributable to the Company was computed by dividing net income attributable to the Company by the average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Certain of the Company’s time-vesting restricted share awards are considered participating securities. Diluted earnings per common share is computed based on the more dilutive of: (i) the two-class method, assuming the participating securities are not exercised or converted; or (ii) the summation of average common shares outstanding and additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential common shares had been issued. During the three and six months ended September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, the two-class method was more dilutive. Securities that could potentially dilute basic EPS in the future that were considered antidilutive in the three and six months ended September 26, 2020 totaled 0.3 million and 0.4 million, respectively. There were no antidilutive securities in the three and six months ended September 28, 2019. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share: Three Months Ended Six Months Ended (Dollars and shares in thousands, except per share data) September 26, 2020 September 28, 2019 September 26, 2020 September 28, 2019 Numerator: Net income $ 17,511 $ 17,745 $ 29,414 $ 35,125 Undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities ( 19 ) ( 65 ) ( 53 ) ( 154 ) Net income attributable to the Company's common shareholders $ 17,492 $ 17,680 $ 29,361 $ 34,971 Denominator: Basic weighted-average shares outstanding 56,654 56,481 56,593 56,424 Dilutive securities 255 243 238 233 Diluted weighted-average shares outstanding 56,909 56,724 56,831 56,657 Basic net income per share $ 0.31 $ 0.31 $ 0.52 $ 0.62 Diluted net income per share $ 0.31 $ 0.31 $ 0.52 $ 0.62 11 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued 1 2 . Segment Information Financial results for the Company's reportable segments have been prepared using a management approach, which is consistent with the basis and manner in which financial information is evaluated by the Company's chief operating decision maker in allocating resources and in assessing performance. The Company’s chief operating decision maker, the Chief Executive Officer, evaluates the performance of the Company’s segments primarily based on net sales, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (“EBITDA”) and operating assets. The Company operates in two reportable segments: (i) U.S. Factory-built Housing, which includes manufacturing and retail housing operations and (ii) Canadian Factory-built Housing. Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation operations, corporate costs directly incurred for all segments and intersegment eliminations. Segments are generally determined by geography. Segment data includes intersegment revenues and corporate office costs that are directly and exclusively incurred for each segment. Total assets for Corporate/Other primarily includes cash and certain deferred tax items not specifically allocated to another segment. Selected financial information by reportable segment was as follows: Three Months Ended Six Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) September 26, 2020 September 28, 2019 September 26, 2020 September 28, 2019 Net sales: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 283,360 $ 312,830 $ 532,219 $ 644,435 Canadian Factory-built Housing 24,558 26,407 39,753 50,107 Corporate/Other 14,448 15,221 23,679 31,804 Consolidated net sales $ 322,366 $ 354,458 $ 595,651 $ 726,346 Operating income: U.S. Factory-built Housing EBITDA $ 28,697 $ 35,314 $ 53,090 $ 71,459 Canadian Factory-built Housing EBITDA 5,951 4,244 10,857 7,299 Corporate/Other EBITDA ( 6,221 ) ( 8,998 ) ( 13,828 ) ( 19,406 ) Other income ( 2,599 ) — ( 6,813 ) — Depreciation ( 3,048 ) ( 3,545 ) ( 5,969 ) ( 6,655 ) Amortization ( 1,360 ) ( 1,362 ) ( 2,721 ) ( 2,724 ) Consolidated operating income $ 21,420 $ 25,653 $ 34,616 $ 49,973 Depreciation: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 2,391 $ 3,068 $ 4,789 $ 5,706 Canadian Factory-built Housing 248 247 363 489 Corporate/Other 409 230 817 460 Consolidated depreciation $ 3,048 $ 3,545 $ 5,969 $ 6,655 Amortization of intangible assets: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 1,360 $ 1,362 $ 2,721 $ 2,724 Canadian Factory-built Housing — — — — Corporate/Other — — — — Consolidated amortization of intangible assets $ 1,360 $ 1,362 $ 2,721 $ 2,724 Capital expenditures: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 1,054 $ 4,144 $ 1,939 $ 7,502 Canadian Factory-built Housing 85 317 242 428 Corporate/Other 102 422 371 1,479 Consolidated capital expenditures $ 1,241 $ 4,883 $ 2,552 $ 9,409 (Dollars in thousands) September 26, 2020 March 28, 2020 Total Assets: U.S. Factory-built Housing (1) $ 489,399 $ 491,110 Canadian Factory-built Housing (1) 68,696 56,760 Corporate/Other (1) 271,376 233,830 Consolidated total assets $ 829,471 $ 781,700 12 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued (1) Deferred tax assets for the Canadian operations are reflected in the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment. U.S. deferred tax assets are presented in Corporate/Other because an allocation between segments is not practicable. 1 3 . Commitments, Contingencies and Legal Proceedings Repurchase Contingencies and Guarantees The Company is contingently liable under terms of repurchase agreements with lending institutions that provide wholesale floor plan financing to retailers. These arrangements, which are customary in the manufactured housing industry, provide for the repurchase of products sold to retailers in the event of default by the retailer on their agreement to pay the financial institution. The risk of loss from these agreements is spread over numerous retailers. The repurchase price is generally determined by the original sales price of the product less contractually defined curtailment payments. Excluding the resale value of the homes, the contingent repurchase obligation as of September 26, 2020 was estimated to be $ 142.6 million. The Company accounts for the guarantees under its repurchase agreements with the retailers’ financing institutions by estimating and deferring a portion of the related product sale that represents the estimated fair value of the repurchase obligation. In addition, the Company has estimated the expected contingent net loss the Company will incur upon resale of any repurchases. These estimates are based on recent historical experience supplemented by management’s assessment of current economic and other conditions affecting retailers for which the Company has a contingent repurchase obligation. Based on these repurchase agreements, historical loss experience, as well as current economic conditions and forecasts that affect the potential loss exposure, a loss reserve of $ 0.9 million and $ 1.0 million was recorded as of September 26, 2020 and March 28, 2020, respectively. Losses incurred on homes repurchased were not significant during the three or six month periods ended September 26, 2020 or September 28, 2019. At September 26, 2020 , the Company was contingently obligated for $ 33.9 million under letters of credit, primarily consisting of $ 12.6 million to support long-term debt, $ 21.0 million to support the casualty insurance program, and $ 0.3 million to support bonding agreements. The letters of credit are issued from a sub-facility of the Credit Agreement. The Company was also contingently obligated for $ 14.3 million under surety bonds, generally to support performance on long-term construction contracts and license and service bonding requirements. In the normal course of business, the Company’s former subsidiaries that operated in the United Kingdom historically provided certain guarantees to two customers. Those guarantees provide contractual liability for proven construction defects up to 12 years from the date of delivery of certain products. The guarantees remain a contingent liability of the Company which declines over time through October 2027. As of the date of this report, the Company expects few, if any, claims to be reported under the terms of the guarantees. Legal Proceedings The Company has agreed to indemnify counterparties in the ordinary course of its business in agreements to acquire and sell business assets and in financing arrangements. The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of its business. As of the date of this filing, the Company believes the ultimate liability with respect to these contingent obligations will not have, either individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 13 Item 2. MANAGEMENT’ S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following should be read in conjunction with Skyline Champion Corporation’s condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear in Item 1 of this Report. Overview Skyline Champion Corporation (the “Company”) is a leading producer of factory-built housing in the U.S. and Canada. The Company serves as a complete solutions provider across complementary and vertically integrated businesses including manufactured offsite construction, company-owned retail locations, and transportation logistics services. The Company is the largest independent publicly traded factory-built solutions provider in North America (based on revenue) and markets its homes under several nationally recognized brand names including Skyline Homes, Champion Home Builders, Genesis Homes, Athens Park Models, Dutch Housing, Excel Homes, Homes of Merit, New Era, Redman Homes, Shore Park, Silvercrest, Titan Homes in the U.S., and Moduline and SRI Homes in western Canada. The Company operates 33 manufacturing facilities throughout the U.S. and five manufacturing facilities in western Canada that primarily construct factory-built, timber-framed, manufactured and modular houses that are sold primarily to independent retailers, builders/developers, and manufactured home community operators. The Company’s retail operations consist of 18 sales centers that sell manufactured homes to consumers primarily in the southern U.S. The Company’s transportation business engages independent owners/drivers to transport manufactured homes and recreational vehicles and other products throughout the U.S. and Canada. Industry and Company Outlook In recent years, manufactured home construction experienced revenue growth due to a number of favorable demographic trends and demand drivers in the United States, including underlying growth trends in key homebuyer groups, such as the population over 65 years of age, the population of first-time home buyers, and the population of households earning less than $50,000 per year. More recently, we see a number of market trends pointing to increased sales of Alternative Dwelling Units (“ADUs”) and urban-to-rural migration as customers accommodate working-from-home patterns, as well as people seeking rent-to-own single-family options. We intend to capitalize on these trends and drivers to grow our business over the medium-to-long-term. We believe that there is an opportunity for continued manufactured and modular construction market expansion driven by the foregoing trends and demand drivers, as well as construction labor shortages in certain regions (which tend to adversely and disproportionally impact supply and cost of site-built homes when compared to manufactured housing) and increased affordability of factory-built homes relative to site-built homes. For the six months ended September 26, 2020 , approximately 76% of the Company’s U.S. manufacturing sales were generated from the manufacture of homes that comply with the Federal HUD-code construction standard in the U.S. Industry shipments of HUD-code homes were 61,589 during the eight months ended August 31, 2020 compared to 62,471 units shipped in same period of the prior year. The Company’s HUD market share during the eight month period ended August 31, 2020 was 15.2% versus 17.1% in the comparable period of the prior year. Annual industry shipments have generally increased each year since calendar year 2009 when only 50,000 HUD code manufactured homes were shipped, the lowest level since the industry began recording statistics in 1959. While shipments of HUD code manufactured homes have improved modestly in recent years, manufactured housing’s most recent annual shipment levels still operate at lower levels than the long-term historical average of over 200,000 units annually. For the six months ended September 26, 2020 , approximately 17% of the Company’s U.S. manufacturing sales were modular. The industry reports U.S. modular market shipments quarterly and three months in arrears. However, reporting of industry shipment data has been delayed and unavailable for the calendar year 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Industry shipments of modular homes were 6,916 units in the U.S. during the first half of calendar year 2019 and the Company’s modular market share during this period was 14.1%. Modular home sales across the industry have generally been stable since 2009. COVID-19 Pandemic The outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (""COVID-19"") was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. There remains continued uncertainty regarding the extent and duration of the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on the economy, the housing market, and the Company, as well as the Company’s employees, customers, and suppliers. The Company has prioritized the safety and well-being of its employees and customers and has implemented standards to operate in accordance with social-distancing protocols and public health authority guidelines. Beginning in March 2020, the Company took actions to temporarily idle certain facilities in response to government shutdown orders or reduced demand. By late April 2020, most of the temporarily idled manufacturing facilities had reopened, but at reduced production levels due to employee absenteeism, difficulty hiring new team members and social distancing protocols. As of September 26, 2020, only one manufacturing facility remained temporarily idled due to labor availability constraints. During the second quarter of fiscal 2021, the Company experienced intermittent closures due to COVID-19 outbreaks at the facilities or surrounding communities causing high absenteeism. By the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2021, the Company was able to restore production rates close to production levels achieved in the prior year period. Availability of labor and certain materials remain constrained. Prices for key raw materials have experienced increased volatility and, overall, manufacturing costs have trended higher than prior periods. 14 Since the start of the fiscal year, the Company’s retail operations have adjusted their operating procedures to comply with local and state mandates; and have generally remained open and have shifted physical visits to a larger on-line presence. The Company consolidated its retail footprint by closing three Company-owned retail sales centers during the second quarter in an effort to optimize costs while taking advantage of an increase in distribution through digital marketing efforts. We have strong local independent retailers to serve customers in those areas. As part of the initial response to the pandemic, the Company offered extended benefits to employees, including increased sick pay and premium payments on healthcare benefits for furloughed employees during the first quarter of fiscal 2021. The Company’s U.S. operations incurred $1.9 million of expense related to the extended benefits. Various government programs have been announced to provide financial relief for affected businesses, including the Employee Retention Credit under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (""CARES Act"") in the United States and the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (""CEWS"") under the COVID-19 Economic Response Plan in Canada. CEWS provides a cash subsidy of up to 75% of eligible employees’ remuneration, subject to certain criteria. The Company recognized $2.6 million and $6.2 million for payroll subsidies under CEWS during the three and six months ended September 26, 2020. The Company also recognized $0.6 million for payroll subsidies under the CARES Act during the first quarter of fiscal 2021. In addition, the CARES Act allows for deferring payment of certain payroll taxes. Through September 26, 2020, the Company has deferred $7.4 million of payroll taxes that will be paid beginning in December 2021.

Net sales for the three months ended September 26, 2020 were $322.4 million, a decrease of $32.1 million, or 9.1% over the three months ended September 28, 2019. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. U.S. Factory-built Housing: Net sales for the Company’s U.S. manufacturing and retail operations decreased by $29.5 million, or 9.4%. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the number of homes sold during the three months ended September 26, 2020 of 337 units, or 6.7%. U.S. housing sales continue to be impacted by indirect factors stemming from the pandemic. Production for the quarter operated at slightly reduced levels as compared to the prior year due to labor availability and intermittent shutdowns caused by COVID-19-related absenteeism. The average selling price decreased due to a shift in product mix to more single section homes and customers selecting less expensive upgrades or option packages versus the same period last year. Product mix fluctuations result from consumer preferences regarding the sizes and styles of homes selected for purchase, opting for home upgrade packages, as well as regional housing dynamics. Canadian Factory-built Housing: The Canadian Factory-built Housing segment net sales decreased by $1.8 million, or 7.0% for the three months ended September 26, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a 4.2% decrease in average home selling price from a shift in product mix and a 2.9% decrease in the number of homes sold. The decrease in revenue was also due to slightly reduced production levels from indirect factors stemming from the pandemic which include constrained labor availability. On a constant currency basis, net sales for the Canadian segment were unfavorably impacted by approximately $0.3 million as the Canadian dollar weakened compared to the U.S. dollar during the second quarter of fiscal 2021 as compared to the same period of the prior year. Corporate/Other: Net sales for Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation business and the elimination of intersegment sales. For the three months ended September 26, 2020, net sales decreased $0.8 million, or 5.1%. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower net sales in the Company’s transportation business largely as a result of lower shipments of RVs. GROSS PROFIT The following table summarizes gross profit for the three months ended September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019 : Three Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) September 26, 2020 September 28, 2019 $ Change % Change Gross profit: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 54,546 $ 65,361 $ (10,815 ) (16.5 %) Canadian Factory-built Housing 4,787 5,953 (1,166 ) (19.6 %) Corporate/Other 3,460 2,741 719 26.2 % Total gross profit $ 62,793 $ 74,055 $ (11,262 ) (15.2 %) Gross profit as a percent of net sales 19.5 % 20.9 % 16 Gross profit as a percent of sales during the three months ended September 26, 2020 was 19.5% compared to 20.9% during the three months ended September 28, 2019. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. U.S. Factory-built Housing: Gross profit for the U.S. Factory-built Housing segment decreased by $10.8 million, or 16.5%, during the three months ended September 26, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to reduced sales volume. Gross profit was 19.2% as a percent of segment net sales for the three months ended September 26, 2020 compared to 20.9% in the same period of the prior year primarily due to increased material costs as a percent of sales caused by market volatility in certain commodities including forest products. Canadian Factory-built Housing: Gross profit for the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment decreased by $1.2 million, or 19.6% during the three months ended September 26, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year. Gross profit as a percent of net sales was 19.5% for the three months ended September 26, 2020, compared to 22.5% in the same period of the prior year. The decrease is due to increased material costs similar to those experienced in the U.S. Corporate/Other: Gross profit for the Corporate/Other segment increased $0.7 million, or 26.2%, during the three months ended September 26, 2020 compared to the same period of the prior year, primarily due to changes in revenue mix and expansion of storage offerings. SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Selling, general, and administrative expenses include foreign currency transaction gains and losses, equity compensation, and intangible amortization expense. The following table summarizes selling, general, and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019: Three Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) September 26, 2020 September 28, 2019 $ Change % Change Selling, general, and administrative expenses: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 29,601 $ 34,476 $ (4,875 ) (14.1 %) Canadian Factory-built Housing 1,683 1,956 (273 ) (14.0 %) Corporate/Other 10,089 11,970 (1,881 ) (15.7 %) Total selling, general, and administrative expenses $ 41,373 $ 48,402 $ (7,029 ) (14.5 %) Selling, general, and administrative expense as a percent of net sales 12.8 % 13.7 % Selling, general, and administrative expenses were $41.4 million for the three months ended September 26, 2020, a decrease of $7.0 million compared to the same period in the prior year. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. U.S. Factory-built Housing: Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the U.S. Factory-built Housing segment decreased $4.9 million, or 14.1%, during the three months ended September 26, 2020 as compared to the same period in the prior year. As a percent of segment net sales, selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased to 10.4% for the three months ended September 26, 2020 compared to 11.0% during the comparable period of the prior year. The decrease resulted from: (i) lower sales commissions and incentive compensation, which is generally based on sales volume or a measure of profitability; and (ii) reduction in costs for travel and marketing-related expenses. Canadian Factory-built Housing: Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment decreased $0.3 million for three months ended September 26, 2020 when compared to the same period of the prior year. As a percent of segment net sales, selling, general, and administrative expenses for the Canadian segment was 6.9% and 7.4% for the three months ended September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, respectively. The decrease resulted from (i) lower sales commissions and incentive compensation, which is generally based on sales volume or a measure of profitability; and (ii) reduction in wages and benefits from headcount reductions. 17 Corporate/Other: Selling, general, and administrative expenses for Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation operations, corporate costs incurred for all segments, and intersegment eliminations. Selling, general, and administrative expenses for Corporate/Other decreased $1.9 million, or 15.7%, during the three months ended September 26, 2020 as compared to the same period of the prior year. The decrease is due to a reduction in equity compensation costs, as well as the benefit from no longer incurring costs related to acquisition integration from the 2018 combination of Skyline Corporation and the operating assets of Champion Enterprises Holding, LLC (the “2018 Combination”). INTEREST EXPENSE, NET The following table summarizes the components of interest expense, net for the three months ended September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019: Three Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) September 26, 2020 September 28, 2019 $ Change % Change Interest expense $ 974 $ 1,195 $ (221 ) (18.5 %) Less: Interest income 110 813 (703 ) (86.5 %) Interest expense, net $ 864 $ 382 $ 482 126.2 % Average outstanding floor plan payable $ 27,309 $ 31,284 Average outstanding long-term debt $ 77,330 $ 48,080 Interest expense, net was $0.9 million for the three months ended September 26, 2020, an increase of $0.5 million compared to the same period of the prior year. The net increase in expense was primarily related to a combination of a reduction of interest income received on the Company’s average cash balances invested in short-term facilities caused by a reduction in interest rates and reduced interest expense on the Company’s borrowings, also due to a reduction in interest rates, despite an increase in the average outstanding long-term debt balance. OTHER INCOME The following table summarizes other income for the three months ended September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019: Three Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) September 26, 2020 September 28, 2019 $ Change % Change Other income $ (2,599 ) $ — $ (2,599 ) 100.0 % Other income for the three months ended September 26, 2020 related to a wage subsidy provided by a Canadian government sponsored financial assistance program enacted in response to the pandemic. INCOME TAX EXPENSE The following table summarizes income tax expense for the three months ended September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019: Three Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) September 26, 2020 September 28, 2019 $ Change % Change Income tax expense $ 5,644 $ 7,526 $ (1,882 ) (25.0 %) Effective tax rate 24.4 % 29.8 % Income tax expense for the three months ended September 26, 2020 was $5.6 million, representing an effective tax rate of 24.4%, compared to income tax expense of $7.5 million, representing an effective tax rate of 29.8%, for the three months ended September 28, 2019. The Company’s effective tax rate for both the three months ended September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019 differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of 21.0%, due primarily to the effect of non-deductible expenses, state and local income taxes, tax credits, and results in a foreign jurisdiction. ADJUSTED EBITDA The following table reconciles net income, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, to Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the three months ended September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019: 18 Three Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) September 26, 2020 September 28, 2019 $ Change % Change Net income $ 17,511 $ 17,745 $ (234 ) (1.3 %) Income tax expense 5,644 7,526 (1,882 ) (25.0 %) Interest expense, net 864 382 482 * Depreciation and amortization 4,408 4,907 (499 ) (10.2 %) Equity-based compensation (for awards granted prior to December 31, 2018) 388 1,534 (1,146 ) (74.7 %) Acquisition integration costs — 340 (340 ) * Other 122 48 74 * Adjusted EBITDA $ 28,937 $ 32,482 $ (3,545 ) (10.9 %) * indicates that the calculated percentage is not meaningful Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended September 26, 2020 was $28.9 million, a decrease of $3.6 million from the same period of the prior year. The decrease is primarily a result of lower operating income after adjusting for the effect of integration costs and equity-based compensation incurred in the prior year. The decrease in operating income is primarily due to a decrease in sales volume and an increase in material costs from market volatility in certain commodities like lumber products. See the definition of Adjusted EBITDA below for additional information regarding the definition and use of this metric. 19 UNAUDITED INCOME STATEMENTS FOR THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2021 VS. 20 20 Six Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) September 26, 2020 September 28, 2019 Results of Operations Data: Net sales $ 595,651 $ 726,346 Cost of sales 478,855 576,256 Gross profit 116,796 150,090 Selling, general, and administrative expenses 82,180 100,117 Operating income 34,616 49,973 Interest expense, net 1,806 691 Other income (6,813 ) — Income before income taxes 39,623 49,282 Income tax expense 10,209 14,157 Net income $ 29,414 $ 35,125 Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA: Net income $ 29,414 $ 35,125 Income tax expense 10,209 14,157 Interest expense, net 1,806 691 Depreciation and amortization 8,690 9,379 Equity-based compensation (for awards granted prior to December 31, 2018) 1,358 2,641 Acquisition integration costs — 1,378 Fair market value adjustment for asset classified as held for sale — 986 Other — 210 Adjusted EBITDA $ 51,477 $ 64,567 As a percent of net sales: Gross profit 19.6 % 20.7 % Selling, general, and administrative expenses 13.8 % 13.8 % Operating income 5.8 % 6.9 % Net income 4.9 % 4.8 % Adjusted EBITDA 8.6 % 8.9 % NET SALES The following table summarizes net sales for the six months ended September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019: Six Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) September 26, 2020 September 28, 2019 $ Change % Change Net sales $ 595,651 $ 726,346 $ (130,695 ) (18.0 %) U.S. manufacturing and retail net sales $ 532,219 $ 644,435 $ (112,216 ) (17.4 %) U.S. homes sold 8,717 10,474 (1,757 ) (16.8 %) U.S. manufacturing and retail average home selling price $ 61.1 $ 61.5 $ (0.4 ) (0.7 %) Canadian manufacturing net sales $ 39,753 $ 50,107 $ (10,354 ) (20.7 %) Canadian homes sold 494 596 (102 ) (17.1 %) Canadian manufacturing average home selling price $ 80.5 $ 84.1 $ (3.6 ) (4.3 %) Corporate/Other net sales $ 23,679 $ 31,804 $ (8,125 ) (25.5 %) U.S. manufacturing facilities in operation at end of period* 33 33 U.S. retail sales centers in operation at end of period 18 21 Canadian manufacturing facilities in operation at end of period 5 5 *One of the Company’s manufacturing facilities is temporarily idled as of September 26, 2020, but still considered operational. Net sales for the six months ended September 26, 2020 were $595.7 million, a decrease of $130.7 million, or 18.0% over the six months ended September 28, 2019. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. 20 U.S. Factory-built Housing: Net sales for the Company’s U.S. manufacturing and retail operations decreased by $112.2 million, or 17.4%. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the number of homes sold during the six months ended September 26, 2020 of 1,757 units, or 16.8%. U.S. housing sales volumes were severely impacted by COVID-19-related factors in the first few months of the fiscal year. Production facilities operated at reduced levels as compared to the prior year due to employee hiring constraints, social-distancing protocols and, in some areas, reduced demand. Production and demand levels began to return to more normal pre-COVID-19 levels during the second quarter. A decrease in average selling price also contributed to the decrease in net sales. The decline in average selling price was due to a shift in product mix to more single section homes and customers selecting less expensive upgrades or option packages versus the same period last year. Product mix fluctuations result from consumer preferences regarding the sizes and styles of homes selected for purchase, selection of home upgrade packages, as well as regional housing dynamics. Canadian Factory-built Housing: The Canadian Factory-built Housing segment net sales decreased by $10.4 million, or 20.7% for the six months ended September 26, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a 17.1% decrease in the number of homes sold, coupled with a 4.3% decrease in average home selling price. The decrease in volume was due to reduced demand and production primarily from oil-related demand drivers and the impacts of COVID-19 for first few months of the fiscal year. Production and demand levels began to return to more normal pre-COVID-19 levels during the second quarter. The decrease in average selling price is due to a shift in product mix. On a constant currency basis, net sales for the Canadian segment were unfavorably impacted by approximately $0.8 million as the Canadian dollar weakened compared to the U.S. dollar during the first six months of fiscal 2021 as compared to the same period of the prior year. Corporate/Other: Net sales for Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation business and the elimination of intersegment sales. For the six months ended September 26, 2020, net sales decreased $8.1 million, or 25.5%. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower net sales as a result of lower shipments caused by COVID-19-related manufacturing shutdowns in both the RV and manufactured housing industries experienced mainly in the U.S. Midwest and Northeast regions in the first few months of the fiscal year. As production in the RV and manufactured housing industries has started to normalize to pre-COVID-19 levels, shipments of these products have also started to increase during the second quarter. GROSS PROFIT The following table summarizes gross profit for the six months ended September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019: Six Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) September 26, 2020 September 28, 2019 $ Change % Change Gross profit: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 102,956 $ 133,676 $ (30,720 ) (23.0 %) Canadian Factory-built Housing 7,569 10,579 (3,010 ) (28.5 %) Corporate/Other 6,271 5,835 436 7.5 % Total gross profit $ 116,796 $ 150,090 $ (33,294 ) (22.2 %) Gross profit as a percent of net sales 19.6 % 20.7 % Gross profit as a percent of sales during the six months ended September 26 , 2020 was 19.6% compared to 20.7% during the six months ended September 28 , 2019. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. U.S. Factory-built Housing: Gross profit for the U.S. Factory-built Housing segment decreased by $30.7 million, or 23.0%, during the six months ended September 26, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year. Gross profit was 19.3% as a percent of segment net sales for the six months ended September 26, 2020 compared to 20.7% in the same period of the prior year. The decrease in gross profit is due to increased material costs from market volatility in certain commodities like lumber products, reduced leverage of manufacturing fixed costs caused by reduced sales volumes, as well as the supplemental COVID-19-related sick pay and health benefits provided to furloughed employees of $1.9 million. Canadian Factory-built Housing: Gross profit for the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment decreased by $3.0 million, or 28.5% during the six months ended September 26, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year. Gross profit as a percent of net sales was 19.0% for the six months ended September 26, 21 2020 , compared to 21.1 % in the same period of the prior year. The decrease is due to increased material costs from market volatility in certain commodities like lumber products and reduced leverage of manufacturing fixed costs caused by reduced sales volumes . Corporate/Other: Gross profit for the Corporate/Other segment increased $0.4 million, or 7.5%, during the six months ended September 26, 2020 compared to the same period of the prior year, primarily due to lower sales in the Company’s transportation operations. Although transportation sales were lower, gross profit improved as a percent of segment net sales to 26.5% from 18.3% as a result of changes in revenue mix and expansion of storage offerings. SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Selling, general, and administrative expenses include foreign currency transaction gains and losses, equity compensation, and intangible amortization expense. The following table summarizes selling, general, and administrative expenses for the six months ended September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019: Six Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) September 26, 2020 September 28, 2019 $ Change % Change Selling, general, and administrative expenses: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 57,977 $ 70,647 $ (12,670 ) (17.9 %) Canadian Factory-built Housing 3,289 3,769 (480 ) (12.7 %) Corporate/Other 20,914 25,701 (4,787 ) (18.6 %) Total selling, general, and administrative expenses $ 82,180 $ 100,117 $ (17,937 ) (17.9 %) Selling, general, and administrative expense as a percent of net sales 13.8 % 13.8 % Selling, general, and administrative expenses were $82.2 million for the six months ended September 26, 2020 , a decrease of $17.9 million compared to the same period in the prior year. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. U.S. Factory-built Housing: Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the U.S. Factory-built Housing segment decreased $12.7 million, or 17.9%, during the six months ended September 26, 2020 as compared to the same period in the prior year. Selling, general, and administrative expenses, as a percent of segment net sales decreased to 10.9% for the six months ended September 26, 2020 compared to 11.4% during the comparable period of the prior year. The decrease in selling, general, and administrative expenses resulted from a combination of factors which include: (i) lower sales commissions and incentive compensation, which is generally based on sales volume or a measure of profitability; (ii) reduction in non-essential costs such as travel and trade shows; and (iii) reduction in wages from headcount reductions and furloughs in response to COVID-19 in the first few months of the fiscal year. Canadian Factory-built Housing: Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment decreased $0.5 million for the six months ended September 26, 2020 when compared to the same period of the prior year. The decrease in selling, general, and administrative expenses resulted from: (i) lower sales commissions and incentive compensation, which is generally based on sales volume or a measure of profitability; and (ii) reduction in wages from headcount reductions and furloughs in response to COVID-19 in the first few months of the fiscal year. As a percent of segment net sales, selling, general, and administrative expenses for the Canadian segment was 8.3% and 7.5% for the six months ended September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, respectively. The increase as a percentage of net sales was a result of less leverage of fixed costs due to reduced sales volumes. Corporate/Other: Selling, general, and administrative expenses for Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation operations, corporate costs incurred for all segments, and intersegment eliminations. Selling, general, and administrative expenses for Corporate/Other decreased $4.8 million, or 18.6%, during the six months ended September 26, 2020 as compared to the same period of the prior year. The decrease is due to a reduction in incentive compensation costs and travel expense, as well as the benefit from no longer incurring costs related to acquisition integration activities from the 2018 Combination, and the fair value adjustment of an asset classified as held for sale recorded in the prior year. 22 INTEREST EXPENSE , NET The following table summarizes the components of interest expense, net for the six months ended September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019: Six Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) September 26, 2020 September 28, 2019 $ Change % Change Interest expense $ 2,061 $ 2,466 $ (405 ) (16.4 %) Less: Interest income 255 1,775 (1,520 ) (85.6 %) Interest expense, net $ 1,806 $ 691 $ 1,115 161.4 % Average outstanding floor plan payable $ 29,188 $ 31,959 Average outstanding long-term debt $ 77,330 $ 50,759 Interest expense, net was $1.8 million for the six months ended September 26, 2020 , an increase of $1.1 million compared to the same period of the prior year. The net increase in expense was primarily related to a combination of a reduction of interest income received on the Company’s average cash balances invested in short-term facilities caused by a reduction in interest rates and reduced interest expense on the Company’s borrowings, also due to a reduction in interest rates, despite an increase in the average outstanding long-term debt balance. OTHER INCOME The following table summarizes other income for the six months ended September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019: Six Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) September 26, 2020 September 28, 2019 $ Change % Change Other income $ (6,813 ) $ — $ (6,813 ) 100.0 % Other income for the six months ended September 26, 2020 was $6.8 million which was a result of wage subsidies provided by government sponsored financial assistance programs that were enacted in responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. The programs included a Canadian wage subsidy benefit of $6.2 million and a U.S. wage subsidy benefit of $0.6 million. INCOME TAX EXPENSE The following table summarizes income tax expense for the six months ended September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019: Six Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) September 26, 2020 September 28, 2019 $ Change % Change Income tax expense $ 10,209 $ 14,157 $ (3,948 ) (27.9 %) Effective tax rate 25.8 % 28.7 % Income tax expense for the six months ended September 26, 2020 was $10.2 million, representing an effective tax rate of 25.8%, compared to income tax expense of $14.2 million, representing an effective tax rate of 28.7% for the six months ended September 28, 2019. The Company’s effective tax rate for the six months ended September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019 differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of 21.0%, due primarily to the effect of non-deductible expenses, state and local income taxes, tax credits, and results in foreign jurisdictions. 23 ADJUSTED EBITDA The following table reconciles net income, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, to Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the six months ended September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019: Six Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) September 26, 2020 September 28, 2019 $ Change % Change Net income $ 29,414 $ 35,125 $ (5,711 ) (16.3 %) Income tax expense 10,209 14,157 (3,948 ) (27.9 %) Interest expense, net 1,806 691 1,115 * Depreciation and amortization 8,690 9,379 (689 ) (7.3 %) Equity-based compensation (for awards granted prior to December 31, 2018) 1,358 2,641 (1,283 ) (48.6 %) Acquisition integration costs — 1,378 (1,378 ) * Fair market value adjustment for asset classified as held for sale — 986 (986 ) * Other — 210 (210 ) * Adjusted EBITDA $ 51,477 $ 64,567 $ (13,090 ) (20.3 %) * indicates that the calculated percentage is not meaningful Adjusted EBITDA for the six months ended September 26, 2020 was $51.5 million, a decrease of $13.1 million from the same period of the prior year. The decrease is primarily a result of lower operating income after adjusting for the effect of integration costs and the fair market value adjustment for an asset classified as held for sale incurred in the prior year. The decrease in operating income is primarily due to a decrease in sales volume and an increase in material costs. See the definition of Adjusted EBITDA below for additional information regarding the definition and use of this metric. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss plus: (a) the provision for income taxes; (b) interest expense, net; (c) depreciation and amortization; (d) gain or loss from discontinued operations; (e) equity-based compensation awards granted prior to December 31, 2018; (f) restructuring charges; (g) impairment of assets; and (h) other non-operating costs including those for the acquisition and integration or disposition of businesses and idle facilities. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of earnings calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income or loss, net sales, operating income, or earnings per share prepared on a U.S. GAAP basis. The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA is commonly used by investors to evaluate its performance and that of its competitors. However, the Company’s use of Adjusted EBITDA may vary from that of others in its industry. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, investors should be aware that, in the future, the Company may incur expenses similar to those adjusted for in this presentation. This presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an implication that the Company’s future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items. Adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are: Adjusted EBITDA: • does not reflect the interest expense on our debt; • excludes impairments; and • does not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; • although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and • other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. Given these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our U.S. GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures only on a supplemental basis. BACKLOG Although orders from customers can be cancelled at any time without penalty, and unfilled orders are not necessarily an indication of future business, the Company’s unfilled U.S. and Canadian manufacturing orders at September 26, 2020 totaled $390.1 million compared to $172.0 million at September 28, 2019. The increase in backlog is driven by increased demand for single-family homes. The increase in demand has 24 resulted in order levels that have outpaced production in both the U.S. and Canada. Production levels vary widely by plant, but have, on average, returned to last year’s average production rates as of the end of September 2020 . Increasing production rates to keep pace with orders is limited by individual plant capacity, time to train new employees, employee attendance, and accessibility of materials. Production may also be limited by additional instances of COVID-19 related impacts, including facility shutdowns . Liquidity and Capital Resources Sources and Uses of Cash The following table presents summary cash flow information for the six months ended September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019: Six Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) September 26, 2020 September 28, 2019 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 63,842 $ 52,158 Investing activities (1,334 ) (9,392 ) Financing activities (8,936 ) (14,829 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents 1,259 168 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents 54,831 28,105 Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period 209,455 126,634 Cash and cash equivalents at end of period $ 264,286 $ 154,739 The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and existing cash balances. Cash balances and cash flow from operations for the next year are expected to be adequate to cover working capital requirements, capital expenditures, and debt payment obligations. The Company does not have any scheduled long-term debt maturities in the next twelve months. The Company’s revolving credit facility includes a leverage ratio covenant that requires the Company’s first lien debt levels to remain less than 2.75 times consolidated trailing twelve-month EBITDA. The Company anticipates compliance with its debt covenants and projects its level of cash availability to be in excess of cash needed to operate the business for the next year. In the event operating cash flow and existing cash balances were deemed inadequate to support the Company’s liquidity needs, and one or more capital resources were to become unavailable, the Company would revise operating strategies accordingly. Cash provided by operating activities was $63.8 million during the six months ended September 26, 2020 compared to $52.2 million during the six months ended September 28, 2019. The increase of $11.6 million in cash from operating activities is primarily due to increased deposits from customers, deferral of certain payroll tax obligations resulting from the CARES Act regulations, the benefit of the CEWS subsidy received, partially offset by lower net income compared to the same period of the prior year. Cash used in investing activities was $1.3 million for the six months ended September 26, 2020 compared to $9.4 million during the six months ended September 28, 2019. The decrease in cash used for investing activities is primarily related to a decrease in capital expenditures in the current period which is primarily due to deferral of non-essential spending as well as non-recurring spending incurred in the prior year related to: (i) expansion of production capacity at the Leesville, Louisiana manufacturing facility; and (ii) investment in equipment to facilitate improvement in safety and operating efficiencies. In addition, the Company received $1.2 million of proceeds from the maturity of a Company owned life insurance policy during the second quarter of fiscal 2021. Cash used in financing activities was $8.9 million for the six months ended September 26, 2020 compared to $14.8 million during the six months ended September 28, 2019. Cash used in financing activities during the first half of fiscal 2021 was related to net repayments on the floor plan payable of $7.6 million and payments for remittance of employee taxes associated with share based compensation programs of $1.7 million. Cash used in financing activities during the first half of fiscal 2020 was primarily related to a $10.0 million repayment on the revolving credit facility, $2.8 million net repayment on the floor plan payable, and a $2.1 million payment for remittance of employee taxes associated with share based compensation programs.

See accompanying Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 5 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 1. Basis of Presentation and Business Nature of Operations: Skyline Champion Corporation (the “Company”) is a leading producer of factory-built housing in the United States (“U.S.”) and Canada. The Company’s operations consist of manufacturing, retail, and transportation activities. The Company operates 33 manufacturing facilities throughout the U.S. and five manufacturing facilities in western Canada. These facilities primarily construct factory-built, timber-framed manufactured, and modular houses that are sold primarily to independent retailers, builders/developers, and manufactured home community operators. The Company’s retail operations consist of 21 sales centers that sell manufactured houses to consumers primarily in the Southern U.S. The Company’s transportation business engages independent owners/drivers to transport manufactured homes, recreational vehicles and other products throughout the U.S. and Canada. COVID-19 Government Financial Assistance: The outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (""COVID-19"") was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. Various government programs have been announced which provide financial relief for affected businesses including the Employee Retention Credit under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (""CARES Act"") in the United States, and the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (""CEWS"") under the COVID-19 Economic Response Plan in Canada. During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, the Company recognized CARES Act subsidies of $ 0.6 million. In addition, the CARES Act allows for deferring payment of certain payroll taxes. Through June 27, 2020, the Company has deferred $ 3.6 million of payroll taxes that will be paid beginning in December 2021. In Canada, the Company recognized $ 3.6 million of payroll subsidies under CEWS during the first quarter of fiscal 2021. The Company’s policy is to account for these subsidies as Other Income in the period in which the related costs are incurred and the Company is reasonably assured to receive payment. As of June 27, 2020, the Company had received $ 1.7 million of the CEWS subsidies. Basis of Presentation: The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) for Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Article 10 of SEC Regulation S-X. Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“U.S. GAAP”) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany balances and transactions. In the opinion of management, these statements include all normal recurring adjustments necessary to fairly state the Company’s consolidated results of operations, cash flows, and financial position. The Company has evaluated subsequent events after the balance sheet date through the date of the filing of this report with the SEC. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the SEC on May 21, 2020 (the “Fiscal 2020 Annual Report”). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The condensed consolidated income statements, condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income, and condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations or cash flows for the full year. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation. The Company’s fiscal year is a 52- or 53-week period that ends on the Saturday nearest to March 31. The Company’s current fiscal year, “fiscal 2021,” will end on April 3, 2021. References to “fiscal 2020” refer to the Company’s fiscal year ended March 28, 2020. The three months ended June 27, 2020 and June 29, 2019 each included 13 weeks. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements: On March 29, 2020, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (""ASU"") 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments ,” using a modified retrospective approach. The standard amends several aspects of the measurement of credit losses related to certain financial instruments, including the replacement of the existing incurred credit loss model and other models with the current expected credit losses (""CECL"") model. The cumulative effect of adoption resulted in an increase of $ 0.2 million in the allowance for credit loss and a corresponding decrease in retained earnings as of March 29, 2020. The Company’s allowance for credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost reflects management’s estimate of credit losses over the remaining expected life of such assets, measured primarily using historical experience, as well as current economic conditions and forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. Expected credit losses for newly recognized financial assets, as well as changes to expected credit losses during the period, are recognized in earnings. As of June 27, 2020 and March 28, 2020, accounts receivable are reflected net of reserves of $ 0.3 million and $ 0.4 million, respectively. As of June 27, 2020 and March 28, 2020, other notes receivable are reflected net of reserves of $ 0.9 million and $ 0.5 million, respectively. Changes in expected credit losses were no t significant in the first three months of fiscal 2021. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, “ Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350), Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment,” which addresses concerns over the cost and complexity of the two-step impairment testing model, and removes the second step of the test. An entity will apply a one-step quantitative test and record the amount of goodwill impairment as the excess of a reporting unit’s carrying amount over its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. The Company adopted the provisions of ASU 2017-04 effective March 29, 2020, and the adoption did not have an impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 6 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued There were no other accounting standards recently issued that are expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations . 2 . Inventories, net The components of inventory, net of reserves for obsolete inventory, were as follows: (Dollars in thousands) June 27, 2020 March 28, 2020 Raw materials $ 52,682 $ 55,408 Work in process 15,914 17,773 Finished goods and other 47,219 53,205 Total inventories, net $ 115,815 $ 126,386 At June 27, 2020 and March 28, 2020, reserves for obsolete inventory were $ 4.3 million and $ 4.2 million, respectively. 3 . Property, Plant, and Equipment Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated primarily on a straight-line basis, generally over the following estimated useful lives: land improvements – 3 to 10 years ; buildings and improvements – 8 to 25 years ; and vehicles and machinery and equipment – 3 to 8 years . Depreciation expense for the three months ended June 27, 2020 and June 29, 2019 was $ 2.9 million and $ 3.1 million, respectively. The components of property, plant, and equipment were as follows: (Dollars in thousands) June 27, 2020 March 28, 2020 Land and improvements $ 35,525 $ 35,332 Buildings and improvements 88,079 87,222 Machinery and equipment 52,567 51,239 Construction in progress 1,181 1,810 Property, plant, and equipment, at cost 177,352 175,603 Less: accumulated depreciation ( 69,377 ) ( 66,312 ) Property, plant, and equipment, net $ 107,975 $ 109,291 4 . Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. At June 27, 2020 and March 28, 2020, the Company had goodwill of $ 173.5 million.

The revolving credit facility allows the Company to draw down, repay and re-draw loans on the available funds during the term of the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement matures on June 5, 2023 and has no scheduled amortization. The interest rate on borrowings under the Credit Agreement adjusts based on the first lien net leverage of the Company from a high of LIBOR plus 2.25 % and ABR plus 1.25 % when the first lien net leverage is equal to or greater than 2 .00:1.00, to a low of LIBOR plus 1.50 % and ABR plus 0.50 % when the first lien net leverage is below 0.50:1.00. In addition, the Company is obligated to pay an unused line fee ranging between 0.25 % and 0.40 % (depending on the first lien net leverage) in respect of unused commitments under the Credit Agreement. At June 27, 2020 the interest rate on borrowings under the Credit Agreement was 1.75 %. At June 27, 2020, letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement totaled $ 28.7 million. Total available borrowings under the Credit Agreement as of June 27, 2020 were $ 6.4 million. On July 15, 2020, additional letters of credit were issued for $ 5.3 million. Total available borrowings under the Credit Agreement as of the date the financial statements were issued was $ 1.1 million. Obligations under industrial revenue bonds are supported by letters of credit and bear interest based on a municipal bond index rate. The weighted-average interest rate at June 27, 2020, including related costs and fees, was 2.24 %. The industrial revenue bonds require lump-sum payments of principal upon maturity in 2029 . 8 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued The Credit Agreement contains covenants that restrict the amount of additional debt, liens and certain payments, including equity buybacks, investments, dispositions, mergers and consolidations, among other restrictions as defined. The Company was in compliance with all covenants of the Credit Agreement as of June 27, 2020 . Floor Plan Payable The Company’s retail operations utilize floor plan financing to fund the purchase of manufactured homes for display or resale. At June 27, 2020 and March 28, 2020, the Company had outstanding borrowings on floor plan financing agreements of $ 29.4 million and $ 33.9 million, respectively. Total credit line capacity provided under the agreements was $ 48.0 million as of June 27, 2020. Borrowings are secured by the homes and are required to be repaid when the Company sells the home to a customer. 8 .

Leases The Company has operating leases for land, manufacturing and office facilities, and equipment. The Company's lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such option. The Company's leases do not contain material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease terms. Lease expense included in the accompanying condensed consolidated income statements is shown below: (Dollars in thousands) Three Months Ended June 27, 2020 Three Months Ended June 29, 2019 Operating lease expense $ 1,383 $ 1,405 Short-term lease expense 456 373 Total lease expense $ 1,839 $ 1,778 9 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued Op erating lease assets and obligations included in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets are below: (Dollars in thousands) June 27, 2020 March 28, 2020 Right-of-use assets under operating leases: Other long-term assets $ 13,440 $ 14,808 Lease obligations under operating leases: Other current liabilities $ 4,502 $ 4,789 Other long-term liabilities 8,938 10,019 Total lease obligation $ 13,440 $ 14,808 Maturities of lease obligations as of June 27, 2020, are shown below: (Dollars in thousands) June 27, 2020 Fiscal 2021 (1) $ 4,081 Fiscal 2022 4,714 Fiscal 2023 3,655 Fiscal 2024 1,547 Fiscal 2025 777 Thereafter 1,712 Total undiscounted cash flows 16,486 Less: imputed interest ( 3,046 ) Lease obligations under operating leases $ 13,440 (1) For remaining period in fiscal year. The weighted-average lease term and discount rate for operating leases are shown below: June 27, 2020 Weighted-average remaining lease term (in years) 4.6 Weighted-average discount rate 5.5 The discount rate used to measure a lease obligation should be the rate implicit in the lease; however, the Company’s operating leases generally do not provide an implicit rate. Accordingly, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate at lease commencement to determine the present value of lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is an entity-specific rate, which represents the rate of interest a lessee would pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term with similar payments. Cash flow information related to operating leases is shown below: Three Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) June 27, 2020 June 29, 2019 Non-cash activity: Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for operating lease obligations $ — $ 854 Operating cash flows: Cash paid related to operating lease obligations $ 1,410 $ 1,534 1 0 . Income Taxes For the three months ended June 27, 2020 and June 29, 2019, the Company recorded $ 4.6 million and $ 6.6 million of income tax expense and had an effective tax rate of 27.7 % and 27.6 %, respectively. The Company’s effective tax rate for both of the three months ended June 27, 2020 and June 29, 2019 differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of 21.0 % due primarily to the effect of non-deductible expenses, state and local income taxes, and results in foreign jurisdictions. At June 27, 2020, the Company had no unrecognized tax benefits. The Company does not anticipate any material changes to uncertain tax benefits in the next twelve months. The Company records interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. 10 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued 1 1 . Earnings Per Share Basic net income per share (“EPS”) attributable to the Company was computed by dividing net income attributable to the Company by the average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Certain of the Company’s time-vesting restricted share awards are considered participating securities. Diluted earnings per common share is computed based on the more dilutive of: (i) the two-class method, assuming the participating securities are not exercised or converted; or (ii) the summation of average common shares outstanding and additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential common shares had been issued. During the three months ended June 27, 2020 and the three months ended June 29, 2019, the two-class method was more dilutive. Securities that could potentially dilute basic EPS in the future that were considered antidilutive in the three months ended June 27, 2020 totaled 0.4 million. There were no antidilutive securities in the three months ended June 29, 2019. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share: Three Months Ended (Dollars and shares in thousands, except per share data) June 27, 2020 June 29, 2019 Numerator: Net income $ 11,903 $ 17,380 Undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities ( 30 ) ( 89 ) Net income attributable to the Company's common shareholders $ 11,873 $ 17,291 Denominator: Basic weighted-average shares outstanding 56,532 56,368 Dilutive securities 229 267 Diluted weighted-average shares outstanding 56,761 56,635 Basic net income per share $ 0.21 $ 0.31 Diluted net income per share $ 0.21 $ 0.31 1 2 . Segment Information Financial results for the Company's reportable segments have been prepared using a management approach, which is consistent with the basis and manner in which financial information is evaluated by the Company's chief operating decision maker in allocating resources and in assessing performance. The Company’s chief operating decision maker, the Chief Executive Officer, evaluates the performance of the Company’s segments primarily based on net sales, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (“EBITDA”) and operating assets. The Company operates in two reportable segments: (i) U.S. Factory-built Housing, which includes manufacturing and retail housing operations and (ii) Canadian Factory-built Housing. Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation operations, corporate costs directly incurred for all segments and intersegment eliminations. Segments are generally determined by geography. Segment data includes intersegment revenues and corporate office costs that are directly and exclusively incurred for each segment. Total assets for Corporate/Other primarily includes cash and certain deferred tax items not specifically allocated to another segment. 11 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued Selected financial information by reportable segment was as follows: Three Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) June 27, 2020 June 29, 2019 Net sales: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 248,859 $ 331,605 Canadian Factory-built Housing 15,195 23,700 Corporate/Other 9,231 16,583 Consolidated net sales $ 273,285 $ 371,888 Operating income: U.S. Factory-built Housing EBITDA $ 23,793 $ 36,145 Canadian Factory-built Housing EBITDA 1,292 3,055 Corporate/Other EBITDA ( 7,607 ) ( 10,408 ) Depreciation ( 2,921 ) ( 3,110 ) Amortization ( 1,361 ) ( 1,362 ) Consolidated operating income $ 13,196 $ 24,320 Depreciation: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 2,398 $ 2,638 Canadian Factory-built Housing 115 242 Corporate/Other 408 230 Consolidated depreciation $ 2,921 $ 3,110 Amortization of intangible assets: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 1,361 $ 1,362 Canadian Factory-built Housing — — Corporate/Other — — Consolidated amortization of intangible assets $ 1,361 $ 1,362 Capital expenditures: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 885 $ 3,358 Canadian Factory-built Housing 157 111 Corporate/Other 269 1,057 Consolidated capital expenditures $ 1,311 $ 4,526 (Dollars in thousands) June 27, 2020 March 28, 2020 Total Assets: U.S. Factory-built Housing (1) $ 476,497 $ 491,110 Canadian Factory-built Housing (1) 61,228 56,760 Corporate/Other (1) 252,597 233,830 Consolidated total assets $ 790,322 $ 781,700 (1) Deferred tax assets for the Canadian operations are reflected in the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment. U.S. deferred tax assets are presented in Corporate/Other because an allocation between segments is not practicable. 1 3 . Commitments, Contingencies and Legal Proceedings Repurchase Contingencies and Guarantees The Company is contingently liable under terms of repurchase agreements with lending institutions that provide wholesale floor plan financing to retailers. These arrangements, which are customary in the manufactured housing industry, provide for the repurchase of products sold to retailers in the event of default by the retailer on their agreement to pay the financial institution. The risk of loss from these agreements is spread over numerous retailers. The repurchase price is generally determined by the original sales price of the product less contractually defined curtailment payments. The Company accounts for the guarantees under its repurchase agreements with the retailers’ financing institutions by estimating and deferring a portion of the related product sale that represents the estimated fair value of the repurchase obligation. In addition, the Company has estimated the expected contingent net loss the Company will incur upon resale of any repurchases. These estimates are based on recent historical experience supplemented by management’s assessment of current economic and other conditions affecting retailers for which the Company has a contingent repurchase obligation. Based on these repurchase agreements, historical loss experience, as well as current economic 12 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued conditions and forecasts that affect the potential loss exposure, a loss reserve of $ 1.0 million was recorded as of Ju ne 27, 2020 and March 28, 2020 . Excluding the resale value of the homes, the contingent repurchase obligation as of June 27, 2020 was estimated to be $ 145.2 million. Losses incurred on homes repurchased were not significant during each of the three months end ed June 27, 2020 and June 29, 2019 . At June 27, 2020, the Company was contingently obligated for $ 28.7 million under letters of credit, primarily consisting of $ 12.7 million to support long-term debt, $ 15.7 million to support the casualty insurance program, and $ 0.3 million to support bonding agreements. The letters of credit are issued from a sub-facility of the Credit Agreement. The Company was also contingently obligated for $ 23.5 million under surety bonds, generally to support performance on long-term construction contracts and license and service bonding requirements. In the normal course of business, the Company’s former subsidiaries that operated in the United Kingdom historically provided certain guarantees to two customers. Those guarantees provide contractual liability for proven construction defects up to 12 years from the date of delivery of certain products. The guarantees remain a contingent liability of the Company which declines over time through October 2027. As of the date of this report, the Company expects few, if any, claims to be reported under the terms of the guarantees. Legal Proceedings The Company has agreed to indemnify counterparties in the ordinary course of its business in agreements to acquire and sell business assets and in financing arrangements. The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of its business. As of the date of this filing, the Company believes the ultimate liability with respect to these contingent obligations will not have, either individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 13 Item 2. MANAGEMENT’ S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following should be read in conjunction with Skyline Champion Corporation’s condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear in Item I of this Report. Overview Skyline Champion Corporation (the “Company”) is a leading producer of factory-built housing in the U.S. and Canada. The Company serves as a complete solutions provider across complementary and vertically integrated businesses including manufactured offsite construction, company-owned retail locations, and transportation logistics services. The Company is the largest independent publicly traded factory-built solutions provider in North America (based on revenue) and markets its homes under several nationally recognized brand names including Skyline Homes, Champion Home Builders, Genesis Homes, Athens Park Models, Dutch Housing, Excel Homes, Homes of Merit, New Era, Redman Homes, Shore Park, Silvercrest, Titan Homes in the U.S., and Moduline and SRI Homes in western Canada. The Company operates 33 manufacturing facilities throughout the U.S. and five manufacturing facilities in western Canada that primarily construct factory-built, timber-framed, manufactured and modular houses that are sold primarily to independent retailers, builders/developers, and manufactured home community operators. The Company’s retail operations consist of 21 sales centers that sell manufactured homes to consumers primarily in the southern U.S. The Company’s transportation business engages independent owners/drivers to transport manufactured homes and recreational vehicles and other products throughout the U.S. and Canada. Industry and Company Outlook In recent years, manufactured home construction experienced revenue growth due to a number of favorable demographic trends and demand drivers in the United States, including underlying growth trends in key homebuyer groups, such as the population over 65 years of age, the population of first-time home buyers, and the population of households earning less than $50,000 per year. More recently, we see a number of market trends pointing to increased sales of Alternative Dwelling Units (“ADUs”) and urban-to-rural migration as customers accommodate working-from-home patterns, as well as people seeking rent-to-own single-family options. We intend to capitalize on these trends and drivers to grow our business over the medium-to-long-term. We believe that there is an opportunity for continued manufactured and modular construction market expansion driven by the foregoing trends and demand drivers, as well as construction labor shortages in certain regions (which tend to adversely and disproportionally impact supply and cost of site-built homes when compared to manufactured housing) and increased affordability of factory-built homes relative to site-built homes. For the three months ended June 27, 2020, approximately 76% of the Company’s U.S. manufacturing sales were generated from the manufacture of homes that comply with the Federal HUD-code construction standard in the U.S. Annual industry shipments have generally increased each year since calendar year 2009 when only 50,000 HUD code manufactured homes were shipped, the lowest level since the industry began recording statistics in 1959. While shipments of HUD code manufactured homes have improved modestly in recent years, manufactured housing’s most recent annual shipment levels still operate at lower levels than the long-term historical average of over 200,000 units annually. For the three months ended June 27, 2020, approximately 18% of the Company’s U.S. manufacturing sales were modular. The industry normally reports U.S. modular market shipments quarterly and three months in arrears. However, reporting of industry shipment data has been delayed and unavailable for the calendar year 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Industry shipments of modular homes were 3,080 units in the U.S. during the first three months of calendar year 2019 and the Company’s modular market share during these periods was 14.6%. Modular home sales across the industry have generally been stable since 2009. COVID-19 Pandemic The outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (""COVID-19"") was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. There remains continued uncertainty regarding the extent and duration of the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on the economy, the housing market, and the Company, as well as the Company’s employees, customers, and suppliers. The Company has prioritized the safety and well-being of its employees and customers and has implemented standards to operate in accordance with social-distancing protocols and public health authority guidelines. Beginning in March 2020, the Company took actions to temporarily idle certain facilities in response to government shutdown orders or reduced demand. By late April 2020, most of the temporarily idled manufacturing facilities had reopened, but at reduced production levels due to employee absenteeism, difficulty hiring new team members and social distancing protocols. At June 27, 2020, two U.S. manufacturing facilities were temporarily idled. Also, during the first quarter, the Company’s retail operations were impacted by various mandates for operating; however, those facilities generally remained open and shifted physical visits to a larger on-line presence. 14 In response to the pandemic, the Compan y offere d extended benefits to employees , including increased sick pay and premium payments on healthcare benefits for furloughed employees. During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, the Company’s U.S. operations incurred $1. 9 million of expense related to the extended benefit s. Various government programs have been announced to provide financial relief for affected businesses , including the Employee Retention Credit under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (""CARES Act"") in the United States and the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (""CEWS"") under the COVID-19 Economic Response Plan in Canada. CEWS provides a cash subsidy of up to 75% of eligible employees’ remuneration, subject to certain criteria. The Company recognized $3.6 million for payroll subsidies under CEWS and $0.6 million for payroll subsidies under the CARES Act during the first quarter of fiscal 2021 . In addition, the CARES Act allows for deferring payment of certain payroll taxes. Through June 27, 2020, the Company has deferred $3.6 million of payroll taxes that will be paid beginning in December 2021.

Net sales for the three months ended June 27, 2020 were $273.3 million, a decrease of $98.6 million, or 26.5% over the three months ended June 29, 2019. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. U.S. Factory-built Housing: Net sales for the Company’s U.S. manufacturing and retail operations decreased by $82.7 million, or 25.0%. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the number of homes sold during the three months ended June 27, 2020 of 1,420 units, or 26.1%. U.S. housing sales volumes were severely impacted by COVID-19-related factors, including government mandated stay-at-home orders. During the first weeks of the quarter, several of the Company’s U.S. manufacturing operations were temporarily idled. Since reopening most of these facilities, production has operated at reduced levels as compared to the prior year due to employee hiring constraints, social-distancing protocols and in some areas, reduced demand. The volume decrease was partially offset by an increase in average selling price. Average selling price increased due to a change in product mix. Product mix fluctuations result from consumer preferences regarding the sizes and styles of homes selected for purchase, opting for home upgrade packages, as well as regional housing dynamics. Canadian Factory-built Housing: The Canadian Factory-built Housing segment net sales decreased by $8.5 million, or 35.9% for the three months ended June 27, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a 32.6% decrease in the number of homes sold, coupled with a 4.9% decrease in average home selling price. The decrease in volume was due to reduced demand and production primarily from oil-related demand drivers and the impacts of COVID-19. Our five Canadian plants were temporarily idled or running at reduced production levels for most of the quarter. The decrease in average selling price is due to a shift in product mix to more single-section homes in fiscal 2021 first quarter versus the same period last year. On a constant currency basis, net sales for the Canadian segment were unfavorably impacted by approximately $0.6 million as the Canadian dollar weakened compared to the U.S. dollar during the first three months of fiscal 2021 as compared to the same period of the prior year. Corporate/Other: Net sales for Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation business and the elimination of intersegment sales. For the three months ended June 27, 2020, net sales decreased $7.4 million, or 44.3%. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower net sales in the Company’s transportation business largely as a result of lower shipments due to COVID-19-related manufacturing shutdowns in both the RV and manufactured housing industries experienced mainly in the U.S. Midwest and Northeast regions. 16 GROSS PROFIT The following table summarizes gross profit for the three months ended June 27, 2020 and June 29, 2019: Three Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) June 27, 2020 June 29, 2019 $ Change % Change Gross profit: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 48,410 $ 68,315 $ (19,905 ) (29.1 %) Canadian Factory-built Housing 2,782 4,626 (1,844 ) (39.9 %) Corporate/Other 2,811 3,094 (283 ) (9.1 %) Total gross profit $ 54,003 $ 76,035 $ (22,032 ) (29.0 %) Gross profit as a percent of net sales 19.8 % 20.4 % Gross profit as a percent of sales during the three months ended June 27, 2020 was 19.8% compared to 20.4% during the three months ended June 29, 2019. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. U.S. Factory-built Housing: Gross profit for the U.S. Factory-built Housing segment decreased by $19.9 million, or 29.1%, during the three months ended June 27, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year. Gross profit was 19.5% as a percent of segment net sales for the three months ended June 27, 2020 compared to 20.6% in the same period of the prior year. The decrease is due to the supplemental COVID-19-related sick pay and health benefits provided to furloughed employees of $1.9 million, as well as reduced leverage of manufacturing fixed costs caused by reduced sales volumes. Canadian Factory-built Housing: Gross profit for the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment decreased by $1.8 million, or 39.9% during the three months ended June 27, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year. Gross profit as a percent of net sales was 18.3% for the three months ended June 27, 2020, compared to 19.5% in the same period of the prior year. The decrease is due to higher labor costs and reduced leverage of manufacturing fixed expenses due to lower volume, partially offset by improved warranty costs. Corporate/Other: Gross profit for the Corporate/Other segment decreased $0.3 million, or 9.1%, during the three months ended June 27, 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to lower sales in the Company’s transportation operations. Although transportation sales were lower, gross profit improved as a percent of segment net sales to 30.5% from 18.7% as a result of changes in revenue mix and expansion of storage offerings. Additionally, increases in intercompany sales elimination activity contributed to the increase in gross margin as the eliminations decreased sales reported in this segment. SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Selling, general, and administrative expenses include foreign currency transaction gains and losses, equity compensation, and intangible amortization expense. The following table summarizes selling, general, and administrative expenses for the three months ended June 27, 2020 and June 29, 2019: Three Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) June 27, 2020 June 29, 2019 $ Change % Change Selling, general, and administrative expenses: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 28,376 $ 36,171 $ (7,795 ) (21.6 %) Canadian Factory-built Housing 1,606 1,813 (207 ) (11.4 %) Corporate/Other 10,825 13,731 (2,906 ) (21.2 %) Total selling, general, and administrative expenses $ 40,807 $ 51,715 $ (10,908 ) (21.1 %) Selling, general, and administrative expense as a percent of net sales 14.9 % 13.9 % Selling, general, and administrative expenses were $40.8 million for the three months ended June 27, 2020, a decrease of $10.9 million compared to the same period in the prior year. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. 17 U.S. Factory-built Housing: Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the U.S. Factory-built Housing segment decreased $7.8 million, or 21.6%, during the three months ended June 27, 2020 as compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease in selling, general, and administrative expenses resulted from a combination of factors which include: (i) lower sales commissions and incentive compensation, which is generally based on sales volume or a measure of profitability; (ii) reduction in non-essential costs such as travel and trade shows; and (iii) reduction in wages from headcount reductions and furloughs in response to COVID-19. Selling, general, and administrative expenses, as a percent of segment net sales was 11.4% for the three months ended June 27, 2020 compared to 10.9% during the comparable period in the prior year. Selling, general, and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales increased in the current period due to less leverage of fixed costs due to reduced sales volumes. Canadian Factory-built Housing: Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment decreased $0.2 million for three months ended June 27, 2020 when compared to the same period of the prior year. As a percent of segment net sales, selling, general, and administrative expenses for the Canadian segment was 11.0% and 7.6% for the three months ended June 27, 2020 and June 29, 2019, respectively. Selling, general, and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales increased in the current period due to less leverage of fixed costs due to reduced sales volumes. Corporate/Other: Selling, general, and administrative expenses for Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation operations, corporate costs incurred for all segments, and intersegment eliminations. Selling, general, and administrative expenses for Corporate/Other decreased $2.9 million, or 21.2%, during the three months ended June 27, 2020 as compared to the same period of the prior year. The decrease is due to a reduction in incentive compensation costs, and travel expense, as well as the benefit from not incurring costs related to acquisition integration expenses and the fair value adjustment on an asset classified as held for sale that were recorded in the prior year. INTEREST EXPENSE, NET The following table summarizes the components of interest expense, net for the three months ended June 27, 2020 and June 29, 2019: Three Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) June 27, 2020 June 29, 2019 $ Change % Change Interest expense $ 1,087 $ 1,271 $ (184 ) (14.5 %) Interest income (145 ) (962 ) 817 (84.9 %) Interest expense, net $ 942 $ 309 $ 633 204.9 % Average outstanding floor plan payable $ 31,067 $ 32,811 Average outstanding long-term debt $ 77,330 $ 53,080 Interest expense, net was $0.9 million for the three months ended June 27, 2020, an increase of $0.6 million compared to the same period in the prior year. The net increase was primarily related to a reduction of interest income received on the Company’s average cash balances invested in short-term facilities due to a reduction in interest rates. The net increase was partially offset by reduced interest expense on the Company’s borrowings, also due to a reduction in interest rates and despite an increase in the average outstanding long-term debt balance. OTHER INCOME The following table summarizes other income for the three months ended June 27, 2020 and June 29, 2019: Three Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) June 27, 2020 June 29, 2019 $ Change % Change Other income $ (4,214 ) $ — $ (4,214 ) 100.0 % Other income for the three months ended June 27, 2020 was $4.2 million related to wage subsidies provided by government sponsored financial assistance programs enacted in responses to the pandemic. The Canadian wage subsidy benefit was $3.6 million and the US wage subsidy benefit was $0.6 million. 18 INCOME TAX EXPENSE The following table summarizes income tax expense for the three months ended June 27, 2020 and June 29, 2019: Three Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) June 27, 2020 June 29, 2019 $ Change % Change Income tax expense $ 4,565 $ 6,631 $ (2,066 ) (31.2 %) Effective tax rate 27.7 % 27.6 % Income tax expense for the three months ended June 27, 2020 was $4.6 million, representing an effective tax rate of 27.7%, compared to income tax expense of $6.6 million, representing an effective tax rate of 27.6% for the three months ended June 29, 2019. The Company’s effective tax rate for both the three months ended June 27, 2020 and June 29, 2019 differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of 21.0%, due primarily to the effect of non-deductible expenses, state and local income taxes, and results in foreign jurisdictions. 19 ADJUSTED EBITDA The following table reconciles net income, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, to Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the three months ended June 27, 2020 and June 29, 2019: Three Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) June 27, 2020 June 29, 2019 $ Change % Change Net income $ 11,903 $ 17,380 $ (5,477 ) (31.5 %) Income tax expense 4,565 6,631 (2,066 ) (31.2 %) Interest expense, net 942 309 633 * Depreciation and amortization 4,282 4,472 (190 ) (4.2 %) Equity-based compensation (for awards granted prior to December 31, 2018) 970 1,107 (137 ) (12.4 %) Foreign currency transaction gain (122 ) (72 ) (50 ) 69.4 % Acquisition integration costs — 1,038 (1,038 ) * Fair market value adjustment for asset classified as held for sale — 986 (986 ) * Restructuring costs — 234 (234 ) * Adjusted EBITDA $ 22,540 $ 32,085 $ (9,545 ) (29.7 %) * indicates that the calculated percentage is not meaningful Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended June 27, 2020 was $22.5 million, a decrease of $9.5 million from the same period of the prior year. The decrease is primarily a result of lower operating income after adjusting for the effect of integration costs, fair market value adjustment for asset classified as held for sale, and restructuring costs incurred in the prior year. The decrease in operating income is primarily due to a decrease in sales volume. See the definition of Adjusted EBITDA below for additional information regarding the definition and use of this metric. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss plus: (a) the provision for income taxes; (b) interest expense, net; (c) depreciation and amortization; (d) gain or loss from discontinued operations; (e) foreign currency gains and losses; (f) equity-based compensation awards granted prior to December 31, 2018; (g) restructuring charges; (h) impairment of assets; and (i) other non-operating costs including those for the acquisition and integration or disposition of businesses and idle facilities. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of earnings calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income or loss, net sales, operating income, or earnings per share prepared on a U.S. GAAP basis. The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA is commonly used by investors to evaluate its performance and that of its competitors. However, the Company’s use of Adjusted EBITDA may vary from that of others in its industry. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, investors should be aware that, in the future, the Company may incur expenses similar to those adjusted for in this presentation. This presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an implication that the Company’s future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items. Adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are: Adjusted EBITDA: • does not reflect the interest expense on our debt; • excludes impairments; and • does not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; • although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and • other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. Given these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our U.S. GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures only on a supplemental basis. BACKLOG Although orders from customers can be cancelled at any time without penalty, and unfilled orders are not necessarily an indication of future business, the Company’s unfilled U.S. and Canadian manufacturing orders at June 27, 2020 totaled $192.1 million compared to $153.0 million at 20 June 29, 2019 . The increase in backlog is driven by strong order levels in both the U.S. and Canada that have outpaced production levels. Production levels vary widely by plant, but have, on average, returned to approximately 90% of last year’s average production rates as of the end of June. Production rates as of the end of June were being impacted by difficulty hiring new employees, higher absenteeism at certain plants and social distancing protocols . Liquidity and Capital Resources Sources and Uses of Cash The following table presents summary cash flow information for the three months ended June 27, 2020 and June 29, 2019: Three Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) June 27, 2020 June 29, 2019 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 32,205 $ 26,780 Investing activities (1,299 ) (4,514 ) Financing activities (4,524 ) (5,653 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents 670 400 Net increase in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash 27,052 17,013 Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash at beginning of period 209,455 126,634 Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash at end of period $ 236,507 $ 143,647 The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and existing cash balances. Cash balances and cash flow from operations for the next year are expected to be adequate to cover working capital requirements, capital expenditures, and floor plan payment obligations. The Company does not have any scheduled long-term debt maturities in the next twelve months. The Company’s revolving credit facility includes a leverage ratio covenant that requires the Company’s first lien debt levels to remain less than 2.75x consolidated trailing twelve-month EBITDA. The Company anticipates compliance with its leverage ratio debt covenant and projects its level of cash availability to be in excess of cash needed to operate the business for the next year. In the event operating cash flow and existing cash balances were deemed inadequate to support the Company’s liquidity needs, and one or more capital resources were to become unavailable, the Company would revise operating strategies accordingly. Cash provided by operating activities was $32.2 million during the three months ended June 27, 2020 compared to $26.8 million during the three months ended June 29, 2019. The increase of $5.4 million in cash from operating activities is primarily due to increases in deposits from customers and commercial projects, deferral of certain payroll tax obligations resulting from the CARES Act regulations, and the benefit of the CEWS subsidy received, partially offset by a reduction of operating income compared to the same period of the prior year. Cash used in investing activities, primarily for capital expenditures, was $1.3 million for the three months ended June 27, 2020 compared to $4.5 million during the three months ended June 29, 2019. The decrease in capital expenditures in the current period is primarily due to deferral of non-essential spending as well as non-recurring spending incurred in the prior year related to: (i) expansion of production capacity at the Leesville, Louisiana manufacturing facility; as well as (ii) investment in equipment to facilitate improvement in safety protocols and operating efficiencies. Cash used in financing activities was $4.5 million for the three months ended June 27, 2020 compared to $5.7 million during the three months ended June 29, 2019. Cash used in financing activities during the first quarter fiscal 2021 was related to net repayments on the floor plan payable balance. Cash used in financing activities during the first quarter of fiscal 2020 was primarily related to the $5.0 million repayment on the revolving credit facility and a $0.6 million net repayment on the floor plan payable balance.

See accompanying Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 5 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 1. Basis of Presentation and Business On June 1, 2018, Skyline Champion Corporation (formerly known as Skyline Corporation), an Indiana corporation (the “Company”), and Champion Enterprises Holdings, LLC (“Champion Holdings”) completed the transactions contemplated by the Share Contribution & Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”), dated as of January 5, 2018, by and between the Company and Champion Holdings. Under the Exchange Agreement, (i) Champion Holdings contributed to the Company all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of each of Champion Holdings’ wholly-owned operating subsidiaries (the “Contributed Shares”), and (ii) in exchange for the Contributed Shares, the Company issued to the members of Champion Holdings, in the aggregate, 47,752,008 shares of Company common stock (“Skyline Common Stock”) (such issuance, the “Shares Issuance”). Immediately following the Shares Issuance, the members of Champion Holdings collectively held 84.5 %, and the Company’s pre-closing shareholders collectively held 15.5 %, of the issued and outstanding Skyline Common Stock on a fully-diluted basis. The contribution of the Contributed Shares by Champion Holdings to Skyline, and the Shares Issuance by the Company to the members of Champion Holdings are collectively referred to herein as the “Exchange.” The Exchange was treated as a purchase of the Company by Champion Holdings for accounting and financial reporting purposes. As a result, the financial results for the nine months ending December 29, 2018 are comprised of the results of 1) Champion Holdings for the period between April 1, 2018 and May 31, 2018 and 2) the Company, after giving effect to the Exchange, from June 1, 2018 through December 29, 2018. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company, have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) for Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Article 10 of SEC Regulation S-X. Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“U.S. GAAP”) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany balances and transactions. In the opinion of management, these statements include all normal recurring adjustments necessary to fairly state the Company’s consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial position. The Company has evaluated subsequent events after the balance sheet date through the date of the filing of this report with the SEC. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the SEC on May 23, 2019. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) and condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations or cash flows for the full year. The Company’s fiscal year is a 52- or 53-week period that ends on the Saturday nearest to March 31. The Company’s current fiscal year, “fiscal 2020”, will end on March 28, 2020. References to “fiscal 2019” refer to the Company’s fiscal year ended March 30, 2019. The three and nine months ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018 each included 13 weeks and 39 weeks, respectively. The Company’s operations consist of manufacturing, retail and transportation activities. The Company operates 33 manufacturing facilities throughout the United States (“U.S.”) and five manufacturing facilities in western Canada that primarily construct factory-built, timber-framed manufactured, and modular houses that are sold primarily to independent retailers and builders/developers. The Company’s retail operations consist of 21 sales centers that sell manufactured houses to consumers primarily in the Southern U.S. The Company’s transportation business engages independent owners/drivers to transport recreational vehicles throughout the U.S. and Canada and manufactured houses in certain regions of the U.S. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements: In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (“ASC 842”), to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. A lessee should recognize in the consolidated balance sheet a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and an asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee have not significantly changed from previous requirements. This ASC 842 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2018 and modified retrospective application is permitted. The Company adopted ASC 842 as of March 31, 2019, the first day of fiscal 2020 using the modified retrospective approach and without restating comparative periods. The Company has elected to apply the transition package of three practical expedients which allow companies not to reassess whether agreements contain leases, the classification of leases, and the capitalization of initial direct costs. The Company did not elect the practical expedient which permits the use of hindsight when determining the lease term and assessing right-of-use assets for impairment. As permitted by the standard, the Company elected to: 1) recognize lease expense for leases with a term of 12 months or less on a straight-line basis over the lease term and will not recognize any right of use assets or lease liabilities for those leases, and 2) not separate lease and non-lease components. 6 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued The primary financial statement impact upon adoption was the recognition, on a discounted basis, of the Company's minimum commitments under non-cancelable operating leases as right of use assets and obligations on the consolidated balance sheets. The adoption of ASC 842 resulted in the recognition of lease-related assets and liabilities of $ 13.7 million. The standard did not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations or cash flows. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Pending Adoption: In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment . The standard simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairments and allows a goodwill impairment charge to be based on the amount of a reporting unit’s carrying value in excess of its fair value. This eliminates the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill or what is known as “Step 2” under the current guidance. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods of public entities beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. This guidance requires the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This guidance also requires enhanced disclosures regarding significant estimates and judgments used in estimating credit losses. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements. There were no other accounting standards recently issued that are expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations. 2. Business Combination The Exchange was completed on June 1, 2018 and was accounted for as a reverse acquisition under the acquisition method of accounting as provided by the FASB Accounting Standards Codification 805, Business Combinations. Champion Holdings was deemed to be the acquirer for accounting and financial reporting purposes. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed as a result of the Exchange were recorded at their respective fair values and added to the carrying value of Champion Holdings’ existing assets and liabilities. The Company incurred acquisition-related costs of approximately $ 6.9 million for the nine months ended December 29, 2018, which were classified as other expense in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. No acquisition-related costs were incurred during the three months ended December 29, 2018. Additionally, the Company incurred approximately $ 6.0 million in equity-based compensation expense related to former Skyline employees during the first quarter of fiscal 2019, which is recorded in selling, general, and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. These types of costs were no t incurred during fiscal 2020. The purchase price of the acquisition was determined with reference to the value of equity (common stock) of the Company based on the closing price on June 1, 2018 of $ 33.39 per share. The purchase price has been allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed using their estimated fair values at June 1, 2018, the closing of the Exchange. The purchase price and the allocation have been used to prepare the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. The purchase price was allocated as follows: (Dollars in thousands) Allocation Cash $ 9,722 Trade accounts receivable 13,876 Inventory 19,028 Assets held for sale 2,086 Property, plant, and equipment 40,220 Deferred tax assets, net 7,034 Other assets 6,706 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities ( 36,027 ) Intangibles 52,065 Goodwill 170,342 Total purchase price allocation $ 285,052 Goodwill is primarily attributable to expected synergies from the combination of the companies, including, but not limited to, expected cost synergies through procurement activities and operational improvements through sharing of best practices. Goodwill, which is not deductible for income tax purposes, was allocated to the U.S. Factory-built Housing reporting unit. Cash, trade receivables, other assets, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities were generally stated at historical carrying values given the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities. Intangible assets consist primarily of amounts recognized for the fair value of customer relationships and trade names and were based on an independent appraisal. Customer-based assets include the Company’s established relationships with its customers and the ability of those customers to generate future economic profits for the Company. The Company estimates that these intangible assets have a weighted average useful life of ten years . Fair value estimates of property, plant, and equipment were based on independent appraisals and broker opinions of value, giving consideration to the highest and best use of the assets. Key assumptions used in the 7 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued appraisals were based on a combination of market and cost approaches, as appropriate. Level 3 fair value estimates of $ 40.2 million related to property, plant , and equipment and $ 52.1 million related to intangible assets were rec ognized in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as a result of the allocation of the purchase price from the Exchange . The Company determined $ 2.1 million of property acquired in the Exchange met the definition of held for sale at the acquisition date and was classified in other current assets . The fair value less cost to sell of this held for sale property was evaluated each reporting period to determine if it has changed. A loss of $ 1.0 million was recorded during the first quarter of fiscal 2020 related to this held for sale property based on updated market information . The sale of the property was completed during the third quarter of fiscal 2020 for $ 1.1 million . Assets held for sale were $ 2.1 million as of March 30, 2019. For further information on acquired assets measured at fair value, see Note 5 , Goodwill and Intangible Assets . The Company allocated a portion of the purchase price to certain realizable deferred tax assets totaling $ 27.3 million. Deferred tax assets are primarily federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and credits offset by a valuation allowance for certain state net operating loss carryforwards that are not expected to be realized. The deferred tax assets are offset by deferred tax liabilities of $ 20.3 million resulting from the purchase price allocation step-up in fair value that exceed the historical tax basis. The statement of operations for the three and nine months ended December 29, 2018 includes $ 63.2 million and $ 153.3 million, respectively, of net sales attributable to the acquired Skyline operations. A summary of the results of operations for the Company, on an as reported and on a pro forma basis, are as follows: Nine Months Ended December 29, 2018 (Dollars in thousands) Reported Pro forma Net sales $ 1,032,368 $ 1,078,172 Net loss ( 67,365 ) ( 52,256 ) The pro forma results are based on adding the historical results of operations of Champion Holdings and Skyline and adjusting those historical amounts for the amortization of intangibles created in the Exchange; the increase in depreciation as a result of the step-up in fair value of property, plant, and equipment; removing transaction costs directly associated with the Exchange; removing equity-based compensation expense directly resulting from the Exchange; reflecting the financing arrangements entered into in connection with the Exchange, and adjusting those items for income taxes. The pro forma disclosures do not give effect to the potential impact of current financial conditions, any anticipated synergies, operating efficiencies or cost savings that may result from the Exchange or any integration costs. The pro forma data is intended for informational purposes and is not indicative of the future results of operations. The Exchange Agreement provided that Champion Holdings was permitted to pay a capital distribution prior to completion of the Exchange to the extent it had cash in excess of debt and other debt-like items and unpaid Exchange fees and expenses. Prior to the completion of the Exchange, Champion Holdings made a capital distribution to its members equal to an aggregate of $ 65.3 million (of which $ 22.5 million was reflected as a reduction to retained earnings and $ 42.8 million was reflected as a reduction to members’ contributed capital). 3 . Inventories The components of inventory, net of reserves for obsolete inventory, were as follows: (Dollars in thousands) December 28, 2019 March 30, 2019 Raw materials $ 49,242 $ 48,531 Work in process 15,235 13,973 Finished goods and other 43,461 60,134 Total inventories $ 107,938 $ 122,638 At December 28, 2019 and March 30, 2019, reserves for obsolete inventory were $ 4.5 million and $ 4.1 million, respectively. 4 . Property, Plant, and Equipment Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated primarily on a straight-line basis, generally over the following estimated useful lives: land improvements – 3 to 10 years ; buildings and improvements – 8 to 25 years ; and vehicles and machinery and equipment – 3 to 8 years . Depreciation expense for the three months ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018 was $ 3.2 million and $ 2.9 million, respectively. Depreciation expense for the nine months ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018 was $ 9.8 million and $ 8.2 million, respectively. 8 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued The components of property, plant, and equipment were as follows: (Dollars in thousands) December 28, 2019 March 30, 2019 Land and improvements $ 35,615 $ 34,264 Buildings and improvements 87,072 83,973 Machinery and equipment 49,288 42,476 Construction in progress 4,124 3,619 Property, plant, and equipment, at cost 176,099 164,332 Less: accumulated depreciation ( 65,155 ) ( 55,745 ) Property, plant, and equipment, net $ 110,944 $ 108,587 5 . Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. At December 28, 2019 and March 30, 2019, the Company had goodwill of $ 173.5 million and $ 173.4 million, respectively. The change from March 30, 2019 was a result of the finalization of the allocation of net assets recognized in connection with the Exchange. Intangible Assets The components of amortizable intangible assets were as follows: (Dollars in thousands) December 28, 2019 March 30, 2019 Customer Relationships Trade Names Total Customer Relationships Trade Names Total Gross carrying amount $ 48,743 $ 13,220 $ 61,963 $ 48,782 $ 13,173 $ 61,955 Accumulated amortization ( 12,407 ) ( 4,842 ) ( 17,249 ) ( 9,052 ) ( 3,967 ) ( 13,019 ) Amortizable intangibles, net $ 36,336 $ 8,378 $ 44,714 $ 39,730 $ 9,206 $ 48,936 The Company recognized finite-lived intangibles for customer relationships of $ 43.1 million and trade names of $ 9.0 million as a result of the allocation of the purchase price from the Exchange. The fair value of the customer relationship intangible asset was estimated using the multi-period excess earnings method of the income approach. The fair value of the customer relationship intangible asset was determined based on estimates and assumptions of projected cash flows attributable to the acquired customer relationships, the annual attrition rate of existing customer relationships, the contributory asset charges attributable to the assets that support the customer relationships, such as net working capital, property, plant, and equipment, trade name, and workforce, the economic life and the discount rate as determined at the time of the final valuation. The fair value of the trade name intangible asset was estimated using the relief-from-royalty method of the income approach. The fair value of the trade names intangible asset was determined based on estimates and assumptions used for the expected life of the intangible asset, the royalty rate and the discount rate that reflects the level of risk associated with the future cash flows as determined at the time of the final valuation. During the three months ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, amortization of intangible assets was $ 1.4 million and $ 1.6 million, respectively. During the nine months ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, amortization of intangible assets was $ 4.1 million and $ 3.3 million, respectively. 6 .

The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility of up to $ 100.0 million, including a letter of credit sub-facility of not less than $ 45.0 million. Initial borrowings under the Credit Agreement were used to repay the Company’s existing $ 46.9 million term loans (“Term Loans”) and replace the Company’s existing cash collateralized stand-alone letter of credit facility. The revolving credit facility allows the Company to draw down, repay and re-draw loans on the available funds during the term of the Credit Agreement. During the three and nine months ended December 28, 2019, the Company repaid $ 5.0 million and $ 15.0 million, respectively, of amounts previously drawn on the revolving credit facility. The Credit Agreement matures on June 5, 2023 and has no scheduled amortization. The interest rate on borrowings under the Credit Agreement adjusts based on the first lien net leverage of the Company from a high of LIBOR plus 2.25 % and ABR plus 1.25 % when the first lien net leverage is equal to or greater than 2 .00:1.00, to a low of LIBOR plus 1.50 % and ABR plus 0.50 % when the first lien net leverage is below 0.50:1.00. In addition, the Company is obligated to pay an unused line fee ranging between 0.40 % and 0.25 % (depending on the first lien net leverage) in respect of unused commitments under the Credit Agreement. At December 28, 2019 the interest rate on borrowings under the Credit Agreement was 3.2 %. At December 28, 2019, letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement totaled $ 28.7 million. Total available borrowings under the Credit Agreement as of December 28, 2019 were $ 44.4 million. Obligations under industrial revenue bonds are supported by letters of credit and bear interest based on a municipal bond index rate. The weighted-average interest rate at December 28, 2019, including related costs and fees, was 3.78 %. At March 30, 2019, the weighted average interest rate was 3.62 %. The industrial revenue bonds require lump-sum payments of principal upon maturity in 2029 . The Credit Agreement contains covenants that restrict the amount of additional debt, liens and certain payments, including equity buybacks, investments, dispositions, mergers and consolidations, among other restrictions as defined. The Company was in compliance with all covenants of the Credit Agreement as of December 28, 2019. Floor Plan Payable The Company’s retail operations utilize floor plan financing to fund the purchase of manufactured homes for display or resale. At December 28, 2019 and March 30, 2019, the Company had outstanding borrowings on floor plan financing agreements of $ 32.4 million and $ 33.3 million, respectively. Total credit line capacity provided under the agreements was $ 48.0 million as of December 28, 2019. Borrowings are secured by the homes and are required to be repaid when the Company sells the home to a customer. 10 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued 9 .

Leases The Company has operating leases for land, manufacturing and office facilities, and equipment. The Company's lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such option. The Company's leases do not contain material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease terms. Lease expense included in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of operations is shown below: (Dollars in thousands) Three Months Ended December 28, 2019 Nine Months Ended December 28, 2019 Operating lease expense $ 1,359 $ 4,234 Short-term lease expense 402 1,005 Total lease expense $ 1,761 $ 5,239 Operating lease assets and obligations included in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet are shown below: (Dollars in thousands) December 28, 2019 Right-of-use assets under operating leases: Other long-term assets $ 11,616 Lease obligations under operating leases: Other current liabilities 3,826 Other long-term liabilities 7,790 Total lease obligation $ 11,616 Maturities of lease obligations as of December 28, 2019, are shown below: (Dollars in thousands) December 28, 2019 Fiscal 2020 (1) $ 1,133 Fiscal 2021 4,155 Fiscal 2022 3,090 Fiscal 2023 2,234 Fiscal 2024 912 Thereafter 2,214 Total undiscounted cash flows 13,738 Less: imputed interest ( 2,122 ) Lease obligations under operating leases $ 11,616 (1) For remaining period in fiscal year. The weighted average lease term and discount rate for operating leases are shown below: December 28, 2019 Weighted average remaining lease term (in years) 5.1 Weighted average discount rate 5.6 The discount rate used to measure a lease obligation should be the rate implicit in the lease; however, the Company’s operating leases generally do not provide an implicit rate. Accordingly, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate at lease commencement to determine the present value of lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is an entity-specific rate which represents the rate of interest a lessee would pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term with similar payments. Cash flow information related to operating leases is shown below: (Dollars in thousands) Nine Months Ended December 28, 2019 Non-cash activity: Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for operating lease obligations $ 1,711 Operating cash flows: Cash paid related to operating lease obligations $ 4,262 12 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued 1 1 . Income Taxes For the three months ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, the Company recorded $ 6.3 million and $ 4.4 million of income tax expense and had an effective tax rate of 27.0 % and 29.7 %, respectively. For the nine months ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, the Company recorded $ 20.5 million and $ 13.7 million of income tax expense and had an effective tax rate of 28.2 % and ( 25.5 %), respectively. The change in the effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended December 28, 2019, compared with the same respective periods of the prior year, was primarily due to costs related to the Exchange including non-deductible equity-based compensation for which no tax benefit could be recognized. The Company’s effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended December 28, 2019 differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of 21.0 % due primarily to the effect of non-deductible expenses, state and local income taxes and results in foreign jurisdictions. The Company’s effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended December 29, 2018 differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of non-deductible expenses, state and local income taxes, one-time charges related to the Exchange and results in foreign jurisdictions and non-taxable entities. During the nine months ended December 28, 2019, the Company’s uncertain tax position did not change. During the nine months ended December 29, 2018, the Company’s uncertain tax position decreased by $ 0.7 million due to expiration of certain statutes of limitations. The Company estimates a $ 0.6 million decrease to uncertain tax benefits in the next twelve months due to the expiration of statutes of limitations. The Company records interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense. Net interest and penalties for the periods presented herein were not significant. 1 2 . Earnings Per Share Basic net income (loss) per share (“EPS”) attributable to the Company was computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to the Company by the average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Certain of the Company’s time-vesting restricted share awards are considered participating securities. Diluted earnings per common share is computed based on the more dilutive of (i) the two-class method, assuming the participating securities are not exercised or converted; or (ii) the summation of average common shares outstanding and additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential common shares had been issued. During the three and nine months ended December 28, 2019 and the three months ended December 29, 2018, the two-class method was more dilutive. The two-class method was not applicable to the computation for the nine months ended December 29, 2018 given the net loss recorded for that period. The number of shares used to calculate earnings per share prior to the Exchange was determined based on the exchange ratio, as defined in the Exchange Agreement. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share: Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended (Dollars and shares in thousands, except per share data) December 28, 2019 December 29, 2018 December 28, 2019 December 29, 2018 Numerator: Net income (loss) $ 17,037 $ 10,513 $ 52,162 $ ( 67,365 ) Undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities ( 44 ) ( 86 ) ( 196 ) — Net income (loss) attributable to the Company's common shareholders $ 16,993 $ 10,427 $ 51,966 $ ( 67,365 ) Denominator: Basic weighted average shares outstanding 56,521 56,249 56,457 52,595 Dilutive securities 267 — 248 — Diluted weighted average shares outstanding 56,788 56,249 56,705 52,595 Basic net income (loss) per share $ 0.30 $ 0.19 $ 0.92 $ ( 1.28 ) Diluted net income (loss) per share $ 0.30 $ 0.19 $ 0.92 $ ( 1.28 ) 1 3 . Transactions with Related Parties Prior to the Exchange, the Company was party to a Management Advisory Services Agreement (“Services Agreement”) with Centerbridge Advisors, LLC; MAK Management L.P.; and Sankaty Advisors, LLC (collectively, the “Managers”), affiliates of which collectively owned a majority of the units of Champion Holdings and the Company’s common stock (the “Principal Shareholders”), whereby the Principal Shareholders provided management, consulting, financial and other advisory services to Champion Holdings. Management fee expense during fiscal 2019, recognized prior to the Exchange, was $ 0.3 million. The Services Agreement was terminated in connection with the Exchange. The 13 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued Management fee expense is included in selling, general , and administrative expenses in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operation . 1 4 . Segment Information Financial results for the Company's reportable segments have been prepared using a management approach, which is consistent with the basis and manner in which financial information is evaluated by the Company's chief operating decision maker in allocating resources and in assessing performance. The Company’s chief operating decision maker, the Chief Executive Officer, evaluates the performance of the Company’s segment primarily based on net sales, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) and operating assets. The Company operates in two reportable segments: (i) U.S. Factory-built Housing, which includes manufacturing and retail housing operations and (ii) Canadian Factory-built Housing. Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation operations, corporate costs directly incurred for all segments and intersegment eliminations. Segments are generally determined by geography. Segment data includes intersegment revenues and corporate office costs that are directly and exclusively incurred for each segment. Total assets for Corporate/Other primarily include cash and certain deferred tax items not specifically allocated to another segment. 14 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued Selected financial information by reportable segment was as follows: Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) December 28, 2019 December 29, 2018 December 28, 2019 December 29, 2018 Net sales: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 304,818 $ 309,518 $ 949,253 $ 882,257 Canadian Factory-built Housing 22,809 27,130 72,916 79,885 Corporate/Other 14,612 18,023 46,416 70,226 Consolidated net sales $ 342,239 $ 354,671 $ 1,068,585 $ 1,032,368 Operating income: U.S. Factory-built Housing EBITDA $ 33,165 $ 30,637 $ 104,624 $ 80,240 Canadian Factory-built Housing EBITDA 1,786 2,569 9,085 9,123 Corporate/Other EBITDA ( 6,771 ) ( 12,741 ) ( 26,177 ) ( 120,937 ) Depreciation ( 3,171 ) ( 2,944 ) ( 9,826 ) ( 8,219 ) Amortization ( 1,345 ) ( 1,633 ) ( 4,069 ) ( 3,316 ) Consolidated operating income (loss) $ 23,664 $ 15,888 $ 73,637 $ ( 43,109 ) Depreciation: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 2,659 $ 2,486 $ 8,365 $ 6,946 Canadian Factory-built Housing 255 237 744 695 Corporate/Other 257 221 717 578 Consolidated depreciation $ 3,171 $ 2,944 $ 9,826 $ 8,219 Amortization of intangible assets: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 1,345 $ 1,572 $ 4,069 $ 3,134 Canadian Factory-built Housing — 61 — 182 Corporate/Other — — — — Consolidated amortization of intangible assets $ 1,345 $ 1,633 $ 4,069 $ 3,316 Capital expenditures: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 1,981 $ 1,463 $ 9,483 $ 4,919 Canadian Factory-built Housing 414 158 842 572 Corporate/Other 306 1,322 1,785 2,136 Consolidated capital expenditures $ 2,701 $ 2,943 $ 12,110 $ 7,627 (Dollars in thousands) December 28, 2019 March 30, 2019 Total Assets: U.S. Factory-built Housing (1) $ 474,427 $ 488,878 Canadian Factory-built Housing (1) 62,430 59,260 Corporate/Other (1) 187,621 151,816 Consolidated total assets $ 724,478 $ 699,954 (1) Deferred tax assets for the Canadian operations are reflected in the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment. U.S. deferred tax assets are presented in Corporate/Other because an allocation between segments is not practicable. 1 5 . Commitments, Contingencies and Legal Proceedings Repurchase Contingencies and Guarantees The Company is contingently liable under terms of repurchase agreements with lending institutions that provide wholesale floor plan financing to retailers. These arrangements, which are customary in the manufactured housing industry, provide for the repurchase of products sold to retailers in the event of default by the retailer on their agreement to pay the financial institution. The risk of loss from these agreements is spread over numerous retailers. The repurchase price is generally determined by the original sales price of the product and pre-defined curtailment arrangements. The Company accounts for the guarantees under its repurchase agreements with the retailers’ financing institutions by estimating and deferring a portion of the related product sale that represents the estimated fair value of the repurchase obligation. The estimated fair value takes into account the estimate of the loss the Company will incur upon resale of any repurchases. This estimate is based on recent historical experience supplemented by management’s assessment of current economic and other conditions affecting the Company’s retailers. The reserve for estimated losses under repurchase agreements was $ 0.9 million at December 28, 2019 and $ 1.0 million at March 30, 2019. Excluding the 15 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued resale value of the homes, the contingent repurchase obligation as of December 28, 2019 was estimated to be approximately $ 147.9 million. Losses incurred on homes repurchased were immaterial during each of the three and nine months ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018 . In addition to the repurchase agreements, the Company has agreed to guarantee a portion of certain retailers’ outstanding loans to a floor plan lender. At December 28, 2019, those guarantees totaled $ 0.6 million, all of which was outstanding at the end of the period. At December 28, 2019, the Company was contingently obligated for approximately $ 28.7 million under letters of credit, primarily consisting of $ 12.7 million to support long-term debt, $ 15.7 million to support the casualty insurance program, and $ 0.3 million to support bonding agreements. The letters of credit are backed by a sub-facility under the New Credit Agreement. The Company was also contingently obligated for $ 24.2 million under surety bonds, generally to support performance on long-term construction contracts and license and service bonding requirements. In the normal course of business, the Company’s former subsidiaries that operated in the United Kingdom historically provided certain guarantees to two customers. Those guarantees provide contractual liability for proven construction defects up to 12 years from the date of delivery of certain products. The guarantees remain a contingent liability of the Company which declines over time through October 2027. As of the date of this report, the Company expects few, if any, claims to be reported under the terms of the guarantees. Legal Proceedings The Company has agreed to indemnify counterparties in the ordinary course of its business in agreements to acquire and sell business assets and in financing arrangements. The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of its business. As of the date of this filing, the Company believes the ultimate liability with respect to these contingent obligations will not have, either individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 16 Item 2. MANAGEMENT’ S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following should be read in conjunction with Skyline Champion Corporation’s condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear in Item I of this Report. Overview On June 1, 2018, Skyline Champion Corporation (the “Company”) was formed by Skyline Corporation (“Skyline”) and Champion Enterprises Holdings, LLC (“Champion Holdings”) combining their operations pursuant to the Share Contribution & Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”), dated as of January 5, 2018, by and between Skyline and Champion Holdings, as described in further detail below. Champion Holdings was formed as a Delaware limited liability company in 2010. Skyline was originally incorporated in Indiana in 1959. The Company is a leading producer of factory-built housing in the U.S. and Canada. The Company serves as a complete solutions provider across complementary and vertically integrated businesses including manufactured offsite construction, company-owned retail locations, and transportation logistics services. The Company is the largest independent publicly traded factory-built solutions provider in North America based on revenue and markets its homes under several nationally recognized brand names including Skyline Homes, Champion Home Builders, Genesis Homes, Athens Park Models, Dutch Housing, Excel Homes, Homes of Merit, New Era, Redman Homes, Shore Park, Silvercrest, Titan Homes in the U.S. and Moduline and SRI Homes in western Canada. The Company operates 33 manufacturing facilities throughout the U.S. and five manufacturing facilities in western Canada that primarily construct factory-built, timber-framed manufactured, and modular houses that are sold primarily to independent retailers, builders/developers, and manufactured home community operators. The Company’s retail operations consist of 21 sales centers that sell manufactured homes to consumers primarily in the southern U.S. The Company’s transportation business engages independent owners/drivers to transport manufactured homes and recreational vehicles throughout the U.S. and Canada. Acquisitions and Expansions Over the last several years, market demand for the Company’s products, primarily affordable housing in the U.S., has continued to improve. As a result, the Company has focused on operational improvements to make existing manufacturing facilities more profitable as well as executing measured expansion of its manufacturing and retail footprint. In response to the increasing demand for affordable housing in the U.S., the Company has increased capacity through strategic acquisitions and expansions of its manufacturing footprint. The Company is focused on growing in strong HUD-markets across the U.S. as well as further expanding into the Northeast and Midwest U.S. modular housing markets. During June 2019, the Company began production at its newest manufactured housing facility in Leesville, Louisiana. During fiscal 2019, the Company completed its expansion of its Corona, California facility by adding a second production line and expanded its Leola, Pennsylvania campus by adding an additional plant. Production at the Leola facility began in April 2019. The Exchange added eight plants to the Company’s manufacturing footprint in fiscal 2019 (described in more detail below). In April 2017, the Company completed the purchase of a factory-built housing plant in Mansfield, Texas. In January 2017, the Company restarted operations at the Liverpool, Pennsylvania location, which was one of five modular manufacturing facilities acquired through a series of transactions with Innovative Building Systems, LLC and its subsidiaries. (“IBS” or the “IBS Acquisition”). The other facilities acquired from IBS are idle and provide the Company with opportunity to add capacity. The Company has also focused on expansion of its company-owned retail operations, opening three additional retail sales centers during fiscal 2018 and five during fiscal 2017. Management believes retail expansion provides an opportunity to increase the Company’s presence in market segments that are not currently served through its independent retail network, while also providing for expansion and increased utilization of existing manufacturing operations. These acquisitions and investments are part of a strategy to grow and diversify revenue with a focus on increasing the Company’s HUD and modular homebuilding presence in the U.S. as well as improving the results of operations. These acquisitions and investments are included in the consolidated results for periods subsequent to their respective acquisition dates. Combination with Skyline On January 5, 2018, Champion Holdings and Skyline entered into an Exchange Agreement pursuant to which the two companies agreed to combine their operations. The Exchange was completed on June 1, 2018 and was accounted for as a reverse acquisition under the acquisition method of accounting as provided by FASB Accounting Standards Codification 805, Business Combinations (“ASC 805”). Champion Holdings was determined to be the acquirer for accounting and financial reporting purposes. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed by Champion Holdings as a result of the Exchange were recorded at their respective fair values and added to the carrying value of Champion Holdings existing assets and liabilities. As Champion Holdings is the accounting acquirer, the Company’s financial results for the nine months ending December 29, 2018 are comprised of the results of 1) Champion Holdings for the period between April 1, 2018 and May 31, 2018 and 2) the Company, after giving effect to the Exchange, from June 1, 2018 through December 29, 2018. 17 Industry and Company Outlook For the nine months ended December 28, 2019, approximately 77% of the Company’s U.S. manufacturing sales were generated from the manufacture of homes that comply with the Federal HUD-code construction standard in the U.S. Industry shipments of HUD-code homes were 87,897 during the eleven months ended November 30, 2019 compared to 90,556 units shipped in same period of the prior year. The Company’s HUD market share during those periods was 17.1% versus 15.4% in the comparable period of the prior year. Industry sales of HUD-code homes have increased since 2009, when 50,000 HUD-code homes were sold. Fewer factory-built homes were sold in 2009 than in any year since 1959. While HUD-code factory-built home shipments have improved modestly over the past few years, the industry continues to operate at relatively low levels compared to historical shipment statistics. For instance, the long-term average for manufactured home shipments since 1960 is approximately 222,000 units per year. For the nine months ended December 28, 2019, approximately 17% of the Company’s U.S. manufacturing sales were modular. The industry reports U.S. modular market shipments quarterly and three months in arrears. Industry shipments of modular homes in the U.S. were 10,843 during the first nine months of calendar year 2019, which was 7.1% lower than the 11,669 units shipped in the comparable period of the prior year. The Company’s modular market share during these periods was 14.0% and 12.1%, respectively. Modular home sales across the industry have generally been stable since 2009.

The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. U.S. Factory-built Housing: Sales of homes for the Company’s U.S. manufacturing and retail operations decreased by $4.7 million, or 1.5% for the three months ended December 28, 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease was due to a 1.8% decrease in average home selling prices resulting from a shift in product mix. Product mix fluctuations result from consumer preferences regarding the size and styles of homes selected for purchase, as well as opting for home upgrade packages as well as regional housing dynamics. The Company sold more single section homes in the three months ended December 28, 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year. Single section homes have a lower average selling price than multi-section homes. Canadian Factory-built Housing: The Canadian Factory-built Housing segment net sales decreased by $4.3 million, or 15.9% for the three months ended December 28, 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease was due to a 16.1% decrease in homes sold. Net sales for the Canadian segment were unfavorably impacted by approximately $0.2 million as the Canadian dollar weakened compared to the U.S. dollar during the third quarter of fiscal 2020 as compared to the same period of the prior year. Corporate/Other: Net sales for Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation business and the elimination of intersegment sales. For the three months ended December 28, 2019, net sales decreased $3.4 million, or 18.9%. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower net sales in the Company’s transportation business primarily as a result of fewer shipments associated with reduced RV demand in the U.S. GROSS PROFIT The following table summarizes gross profit for the three months ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018 : Three Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) December 28, 2019 December 29, 2018 $ Change % Change Gross profit: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 61,200 $ 57,118 $ 4,082 7.1 % Canadian Factory-built Housing 4,512 5,046 (534 ) (10.6 %) Corporate/Other 3,189 2,572 617 24.0 % Total gross profit $ 68,901 $ 64,736 $ 4,165 6.4 % Gross profit as a percent of net sales 20.1 % 18.3 % Gross profit as a percent of net sales during the three months ended December 28, 2019 was 20.1% compared to 18.3% during three months ended December 29, 2018. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. 19 U.S. Factory-built Housing: Gross profit for the U.S. Factory-built Housing segment increased by $4.1 million, or 7.1%, during the three months ended December 28, 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year. Gross profit was 20.1% as a percent of segment net sales for the three months ended December 28, 2019 compared to 18.5% in the same period of the prior year. Gross profit expansion was driven by procurement and operational synergies related to the Exchange, refinement of product offerings, and plant operating improvements, all of which were partially offset by labor inflation. Canadian Factory-built Housing: Gross profit for the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment decreased $0.5 million, or 10.6%, during the three months ended December 28, 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year. Gross profit as a percent of net segment sales was 19.8% for the three months ended December 28, 2019, compared to 18.6% in the same period of the prior year. Although the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment saw lower volume compared to the prior period, margins improved due to lower material cost inputs. Corporate/Other: Gross profit for the Corporate/Other segment increased $0.6 million, or 24.0%, during the three months ended December 28, 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year. Corporate/Other gross profit improved as a percent of segment net sales to 21.8% from 14.3 %. Gross margins for the Company’s transportation business improved as a percent of sales due to a change in revenue mix and lower variable expenses. SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Selling, general, and administrative expenses include foreign currency transaction gains and losses, equity compensation, and intangible amortization expense. The following table summarizes selling, general, and administrative expenses for the three months ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018: Three Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) December 28, 2019 December 29, 2018 $ Change % Change Selling, general, and administrative expenses: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 32,039 $ 30,539 $ 1,500 4.9 % Canadian Factory-built Housing 2,980 2,787 193 6.9 % Corporate/Other 10,218 15,522 (5,304 ) (34.2 %) Total selling, general, and administrative expenses $ 45,237 $ 48,848 $ (3,611 ) (7.4 %) Selling, general, and administrative expense as a percent of net sales 13.2 % 13.8 % Selling, general, and administrative expenses were $45.2 million for the three months ended December 28, 2019, a decrease of $3.6 million compared to the same period in the prior year.

Canadian Factory-built Housing: Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment increased $0.2 million, or 6.9%, during the three months ended December 28, 2019 as compared to the same period of the prior year. As a percent of segment net sales, selling, general, and administrative expenses for the Canadian segment was 13.1% for the three months ended December 28, 2019 compared to 10.3% for the same period in the prior year. The increase as a percentage of sales is due to the decrease in sales volume. Corporate/Other: Selling, general, and administrative expenses for Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation operations, corporate costs incurred for all segments and intersegment eliminations. Selling, general, and administrative expenses for Corporate/Other decreased $5.3 20 million , or 34.2 %, during the three months ended December 28, 2019 as compared to the same period of the prior year . The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in equity - based compensation , integration costs related to the Exchange , and the benefit of run rate synergies from the Exchange . INTEREST EXPENSE, NET The following table summarizes the components of interest expense, net for the three months ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018: Three Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) December 28, 2019 December 29, 2018 $ Change % Change Interest expense $ 1,111 $ 1,308 $ (197 ) (15.1 %) Interest income (783 ) (495 ) (288 ) 58.2 % Interest expense, net $ 328 $ 813 $ (485 ) (59.7 %) Average outstanding floor plan payable $ 32,178 $ 35,973 Average outstanding long-term debt $ 42,663 $ 59,330 Interest expense, net was $0.3 million for the three months ended December 28, 2019, a decrease of $0.5 million compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease was related to: (i) higher interest income recognized during the period as a result of higher average cash balances invested in short term facilities and (ii) lower outstanding balance on the credit facility and floor plan payable as compared to the same period in the prior year. INCOME TAX EXPENSE The following table summarizes income tax expense for the three months ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018: Three Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) December 28, 2019 December 29, 2018 $ Change % Change Income tax expense $ 6,299 $ 4,437 $ 1,862 42.0 % Effective tax rate 27.0 % 29.7 % Income tax expense for the three months ended December 28, 2019 was $6.3 million, representing an effective tax rate of 27.0%, compared to income tax expense of $4.4 million, representing an effective tax rate of 29.7%, for the three months ended December 29, 2018. The Company’s effective tax rate for the three months ended December 28, 2019 differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of 21.0%, due primarily to the effect of non-deductible expenses, state and local income taxes, and results in foreign jurisdictions. The Company’s effective tax rate for the three months ended December 29, 2018 differed from the federal statutory rate of 21.0% primarily due to the effect of non-deductible expenses, state and local income taxes, one-time charges related to the Exchange including non-deductible equity-based compensation and results of operations in foreign jurisdictions and non-taxable entities. ADJUSTED EBITDA The following table reconciles net income, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, to Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the three months ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018: Three Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) December 28, 2019 December 29, 2018 $ Change % Change Net income $ 17,037 $ 10,513 $ 6,524 62.1 % Income tax expense 6,299 4,437 1,862 42.0 % Interest expense, net 328 813 (485 ) (59.7 %) Depreciation and amortization 4,516 4,577 (61 ) (1.3 %) Equity-based compensation (for awards granted prior to December 31, 2018) 965 3,662 (2,697 ) (73.6 %) Foreign currency transaction (gain) loss (68 ) 155 (223 ) * Acquisition integration costs 560 1,998 (1,438 ) (72.0 %) Restructuring costs and other 108 252 (144 ) (57.1 %) Adjusted EBITDA $ 29,745 $ 26,407 $ 3,338 12.6 % 21 * indicates that the calculated percentage is not meaningful Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended December 28, 2019 was $29.7 million, an increase of $3.3 million from the same period of the prior year.

See Adjusted EBITDA definition below for additional information regarding the definition and use of this metric in evaluating the Company’s results. UNAUDITED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 VS. 2019 Nine Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) December 28, 2019 December 29, 2018 Results of Operations Data: Net sales $ 1,068,585 $ 1,032,368 Cost of sales 849,594 853,472 Gross profit 218,991 178,896 Selling, general, and administrative expenses 145,354 222,005 Operating income (loss) 73,637 (43,109 ) Interest expense, net 1,019 2,712 Other expense — 7,845 Income (loss) before income taxes 72,618 (53,666 ) Income tax expense 20,456 13,699 Net income (loss) $ 52,162 $ (67,365 ) Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA: Net income (loss) $ 52,162 $ (67,365 ) Income tax expense 20,456 13,699 Interest expense, net 1,019 2,712 Depreciation and amortization 13,895 11,535 Equity-based compensation (for awards granted prior to December 31, 2018) 3,606 97,589 Foreign currency transaction (gain) loss (93 ) 188 Transaction costs — 6,905 Acquisition integration costs 1,938 5,500 Equity-offering costs — 816 Fair market value adjustment for asset classified as held for sale 986 — Restructuring costs and other 343 1,362 Adjusted EBITDA $ 94,312 $ 72,941 As a percent of net sales: Gross profit 20.5 % 17.3 % Selling, general, and administrative expenses 13.6 % 21.5 % Operating income (loss) 6.9 % (4.2 %) Net income (loss) 4.9 % (6.5 %) Adjusted EBITDA 8.8 % 7.1 % 22 NET SALES The following table summarizes net sales for the nine months ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018: Nine Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) December 28, 2019 December 29, 2018 $ Change % Change Net sales $ 1,068,585 $ 1,032,368 $ 36,217 3.5 % U.S. manufacturing and retail net sales $ 949,253 $ 882,257 $ 66,996 7.6 % U.S. homes sold 15,507 14,606 901 6.2 % U.S. manufacturing and retail average home selling price $ 61.2 $ 60.4 $ 0.8 1.3 % Canadian manufacturing net sales $ 72,916 $ 79,885 $ (6,969 ) (8.7 %) Canadian homes sold 872 1,003 (131 ) (13.1 %) Canadian manufacturing average home selling price $ 83.6 $ 79.6 $ 4.0 5.0 % Corporate/Other net sales $ 46,416 $ 70,226 $ (23,810 ) (33.9 %) U.S. manufacturing facilities in operation at end of period 33 31 2 6.5 % U.S. retail sales centers in operation at end of period 21 21 — — % Canadian manufacturing facilities in operation at end of period 5 5 — — % Net sales for the nine months ended December 28, 2019 were $1,069 million, an increase of $36.2 million, or 3.5% over the nine months ended December 29, 2018. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. U.S. Factory-built Housing: The U.S. Factory-built Housing segment accounted for the Company’s overall net sales growth for the nine months ended December 28, 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year. Sales of homes for the Company’s U.S. manufacturing and retail operations increased by $67.0 million, or 7.6%. The number of homes sold during the nine months ended December 28, 2019 increased by 901 units, or 6.2%. Net sales increased by $50.4 million due to the inclusion of the Skyline operations for all nine months of fiscal 2020 compared to the same period of the prior year which only included seven months of Skyline operations. The remainder of the increase was due to a combination of factors which included additional manufacturing capacity, plant operating improvements, and an increase in the average home selling price which was driven primarily by product mix. Product mix fluctuations result from consumer preferences regarding the sizes and styles of homes selected for purchase, opting for home upgrade packages, as well as regional housing dynamics. Canadian Factory-built Housing: The Canadian Factory-built Housing segment net sales decreased by $7.0 million, or 8.7% for the nine months ended December 28, 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a 13.1% decrease in number of homes sold, partially offset by a 5.0% increase in average home selling price which was a result of pricing actions taken by the Company as well as shifts in product mix. The number of homes sold decreased due to the decline in housing demand in the British Columbia and Alberta provinces versus the same period in the prior year. On a constant currency basis, net sales for the Canadian segment were unfavorably impacted by approximately $1.5 million as the Canadian dollar weakened compared to the U.S. dollar during the first nine months of fiscal 2020 as compared to the same period of the prior year. Corporate/Other: Net sales for Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation business and the elimination of intersegment sales. For the nine months ended December 28, 2019, net sales decreased $23.8 million, or 33.9%. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower net sales in the Company’s transportation business primarily as a result of lower shipments associated with reduced RV demand in the U.S. 23 GROSS PROFIT The following table summarizes gross profit for the nine months ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018: Nine Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) December 28, 2019 December 29, 2018 $ Change % Change Gross profit: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 194,876 $ 153,147 $ 41,729 27.2 % Canadian Factory-built Housing 15,091 14,988 103 0.7 % Corporate/Other 9,024 10,761 (1,737 ) (16.1 %) Total gross profit $ 218,991 $ 178,896 $ 40,095 22.4 % Gross profit as a percent of net sales 20.5 % 17.3 % Gross profit as a percent of sales during the nine months ended December 28, 2019 was 20.5% compared to 17.3% during nine months ended December 29, 2018. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. U.S. Factory-built Housing: Gross profit for the U.S. Factory-built Housing segment increased by $41.7 million, or 27.2%, during the nine months ended December 28, 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in gross profit is due to the increase in sales volumes and improved margins. Gross profit was 20.5% as a percent of segment net sales for the nine months ended December 28, 2019 compared to 17.4% in the same period of the prior year. Gross profit expansion was driven by favorable material pricing, refinement of product offerings, plant operating improvements, and procurement and operational synergies related to the Exchange, all of which were partially offset by labor inflation. Canadian Factory-built Housing: Gross profit for the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment remained flat during the nine months ended December 28, 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year. Gross profit as a percent of net sales was 20.7% for the nine months ended December 28, 2019, compared to 18.8% in the same period of the prior year. Although the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment saw lower volume compared to the prior period, margins improved due to lower cost of material. Corporate/Other: Gross profit for the Corporate/Other segment decreased $1.7 million, or 16.1%, during the nine months ended December 28, 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year due to lower sales volume. Corporate/Other gross profit improved as a percent of segment net sales to 19.4% from 15.3%. Gross margins for the Company’s transportation business improved as a percent of sales due to a change in revenue mix and lower variable expenses. A portion of the change in revenue mix is due in part to less brokered business to other providers at lower margins in response to the decline in revenue caused by the softening market demand for RVs. SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Selling, general, and administrative expenses include foreign currency transaction gains and losses, equity compensation and intangible amortization expense. The following table summarizes selling, general, and administrative expenses for the nine months ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018: Nine Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) December 28, 2019 December 29, 2018 $ Change % Change Selling, general, and administrative expenses: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 102,686 $ 82,987 $ 19,699 23.7 % Canadian Factory-built Housing 6,749 6,753 (4 ) (0.1 %) Corporate/Other 35,919 132,265 (96,346 ) (72.8 %) Total selling, general, and administrative expenses $ 145,354 $ 222,005 $ (76,651 ) (34.5 %) Selling, general, and administrative expense as a percent of net sales 13.6 % 21.5 % Selling, general, and administrative expenses were $145.4 million for the nine months ended December 28, 2019, a decrease of $76.7 million compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to equity-based compensation expense recognized in the prior year, as explained below. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. 24 U.S. Factory-built Housing: Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the U.S. Factory-built Housing segment increased $19.7 million, or 23.7%, during the nine months ended December 28, 2019 as compared to the same period in the prior year. Selling, general, and administrative expenses, as a percent of segment net sales, was 10.8% for the nine months ended December 28, 2019 compared to 9.4% during the comparable period in the prior year. The first nine months of fiscal 2019 only included seven months of Skyline operations, while the same period in the current year included nine months of Skyline operations. The additional two months of Skyline activity, as well as intangible amortization related to the Exchange, increased selling, general, and administrative expenses by $4.5 million. The Company recorded additional SG&A costs for the Leesville, LA capacity expansion of $2.4 million during the nine months ended December 28, 2019. The remainder of the increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses was a combination of factors which include (i) higher sales commissions and incentive compensation, which is generally based on sales volume or a measure of profitability, and (ii) an increase in salaries and benefits to maintain competitive compensation packages to retain and recruit team members. Canadian Factory-built Housing: Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment remained flat for nine months ended December 28, 2019 when compared to the same period of the prior year. As a percent of segment net sales, selling, general, and administrative expenses for the Canadian segment was 9.3% and 8.5% for the nine months ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, respectively. Selling, general, and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales increased in the current period due to the decrease in net sales. Corporate/Other: Selling, general, and administrative expenses for Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation operations, corporate costs incurred for all segments and intersegment eliminations. Selling, general, and administrative expenses for Corporate/Other decreased $96.3 million, or 72.8%, during the nine months ended December 28, 2019 as compared to the same period of the prior year. The decrease is mainly related to a change in equity-based compensation expense of $93.9 million related to the Exchange and secondary offerings that occurred in the prior year, as well as a reduction in acquisition integration and restructuring costs of $4.4 million. This decrease was partially offset by a fair market value adjustment charge of $1.0 million related to property acquired in the Exchange. INTEREST EXPENSE, NET The following table summarizes the components of interest expense, net for the nine months ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018: Nine Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) December 28, 2019 December 29, 2018 $ Change % Change Interest expense $ 3,577 $ 4,007 $ (430 ) (10.7 %) Interest income (2,558 ) (1,295 ) (1,263 ) 97.5 % Interest expense, net $ 1,019 $ 2,712 $ (1,693 ) (62.4 %) Average outstanding floor plan payable $ 31,880 $ 31,596 Average outstanding long-term debt $ 47,663 $ 59,258 Interest expense, net was $1.0 million for the nine months ended December 28, 2019, a decrease of $1.7 million compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease was primarily related to higher interest income recognized during the period as a result of higher average cash balances invested in short term facilities. In addition, the Company incurred reduced interest expense due to (i) a lower weighted average interest rate on its revolving credit facility of 3.7% as compared to 4.8%, and (ii) lower average outstanding balances on its credit facilities as compared to the same period in the prior year. OTHER EXPENSE The following table summarizes other expense for the nine months ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018: Nine Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) December 28, 2019 December 29, 2018 $ Change % Change Other expense $ — $ 7,845 $ (7,845 ) (100.0 %) 25 Other expense for the nine months ended December 29, 2018 primarily consists of $6.9 million of expenses related to legal , accounting , and advisory services associated with the Exchange. The Company also incurred $0.8 million of expenses for legal, accounting, and advisory services related to the secondary o ffering s . INCOME TAX EXPENSE The following table summarizes income tax expense for the nine months ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018: Nine Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) December 28, 2019 December 29, 2018 $ Change % Change Income tax expense $ 20,456 $ 13,699 $ 6,757 49.3 % Effective tax rate 28.2 % (25.5 %) Income tax expense for the nine months ended December 28, 2019 was $20.5 million, representing an effective tax rate of 28.2%, compared to income tax expense of $13.7 million, representing an effective tax rate of (25.5%), for the nine months ended December 29, 2018. The Company’s effective tax rate for the nine months ended December 28, 2019 differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of 21.0%, due primarily to the effect of non-deductible expenses, state and local income taxes, and results in foreign jurisdictions. The Company’s effective tax rate for the nine months ended December 29, 2018 differed from the federal statutory rate of 21.0% primarily due the effect of non-deductible expenses, state and local income taxes, one-time charges related to the Exchange including non-deductible equity-based compensation and results of operations in foreign jurisdictions and non-taxable entities. ADJUSTED EBITDA The following table reconciles net income, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, to Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the nine months ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018: Nine Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) December 28, 2019 December 29, 2018 $ Change % Change Net income (loss) $ 52,162 $ (67,365 ) $ 119,527 * Income tax expense 20,456 13,699 6,757 49.3 % Interest expense, net 1,019 2,712 (1,693 ) (62.4 %) Depreciation and amortization 13,895 11,535 2,360 20.5 % Equity-based compensation (for awards granted prior to December 31, 2018) 3,606 97,589 (93,983 ) (96.3 %) Foreign currency transaction (gain) loss (93 ) 188 (281 ) * Transaction costs — 6,905 (6,905 ) * Acquisition integration costs 1,938 5,500 (3,562 ) (64.8 %) Equity-offering costs — 816 (816 ) * Fair market value adjustment for asset classified as held for sale 986 — 986 * Restructuring costs and other 343 1,362 (1,019 ) (74.8 %) Adjusted EBITDA $ 94,312 $ 72,941 $ 21,371 29.3 % * indicates that the calculated percentage is not meaningful Adjusted EBITDA for the nine months ended December 28, 2019 was $94.3 million, an increase of $21.4 million from the same period of the prior year. The increase is primarily a result of increased operating income after adjusting for the effect of increased depreciation and amortization, transaction-related expenses, integration costs, restructuring costs and equity-based compensation incurred in connection with the Exchange. The increase in operating income is primarily due to an increase in sales volume from the inclusion of the Skyline operations and an improvement in gross profit margins partially offset by higher selling , general, and administrative costs. See Adjusted EBITDA definition below for additional information regarding the definition and use of this metric in evaluating the Company’s results. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss plus (a) the provision for income taxes, (b) interest expense, net, (c) depreciation and amortization, (d) gain or loss from discontinued operations, (e) foreign currency gains and losses, (f) equity-based compensation awards granted prior to December 31, 2018, (g) restructuring charges and other, (h) impairment of assets, and (i) other non-operating costs including those for the acquisition and integration or disposition of businesses and idle facilities. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of earnings calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income or loss, net sales, operating income or earnings per share prepared on a U.S. GAAP basis. The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA is commonly used by investors to evaluate its performance and that of its competitors. However, the Company’s use of Adjusted EBITDA may vary from that of others in its industry. 26 In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, investors should be aware that in the future the Company may incur expenses similar to those adjusted for in this presentation. This presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that the Company’s future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items. Adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are: Adjusted EBITDA: • does not reflect the interest expense on our debt; • excludes impairments; and • does not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; • although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and • other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our U.S. GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures only on a supplemental basis. BACKLOG Although orders from customers can be cancelled at any time without penalty, and unfilled orders are not necessarily an indication of future business, the Company’s unfilled U.S. and Canadian manufacturing orders at December 28, 2019 totaled $133.1 million compared to $181.3 million at December 29, 2018. The reduction in backlog is driven by a decrease in order rates from customers. The timing of customer orders are driven by manufacturer delivery times which are shorter, generally, than the same time last year. In addition, backlog for Canadian operations was lower in the current period due to continued softness in the western Canada housing markets. Liquidity and Capital Resources Sources and Uses of Cash The following table presents summary cash flow information for the nine months ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018: Nine Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) December 28, 2019 December 29, 2018 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 73,077 $ 51,918 Investing activities (10,966 ) 2,396 Financing activities (17,968 ) (60,815 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents 510 (1,130 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash 44,653 (7,631 ) Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash at beginning of period 126,634 136,616 Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash at end of period $ 171,287 $ 128,985 The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, existing cash balances, and borrowings under available credit facilities. The Company has $44.4 million of unused borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facility. Cash balances and cash flow from operations for the next year are expected to be adequate to fund capital expenditures. The level of cash availability is projected to be in excess of cash needed to operate the business for the next year. In the event operating cash flow is inadequate and one or more capital resources were to become unavailable, the Company would revise operating strategies accordingly. Cash provided by operating activities was $73.1 million during the nine months ended December 28, 2019 compared to $51.9 million during the nine months ended December 29, 2018. Cash was generated by operating income (before non-cash charges) from higher sales and operating margins compared to the prior year. Additionally, there were no transaction expenses incurred for the Skyline acquisition or secondary offering costs through the third quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to $7.7 million in the same period of the prior year, which contributed to the positive increase in cash provided by operating activities compared to the prior period. 27 Cash used in investing activities was $ 11.0 million for the nine months ended December 28, 2019 , primarily related to the $12. 1 million of capital expenditures , partially offset by proceeds of $1.1 million from the disposition of a held for sale property . The expenditures for capital items are part of the Company’s focus on safety and operating efficiency initiatives as well as the expansion of production capacity with the investment in the new Leesville, Louisiana manufacturing facility . Cash provided by investing activities was $ 2.4 millio n during the nine months ended December 29, 2018 as a result of cash acquired in the Exchange of $9.7 million and payments received on notes receivable of $0.3 million , partially offset by capital expenditures of $ 7.6 million. Cash used in financing activities was $18.0 million for the nine months ended December 28, 2019, primarily related to the $15.0 million repayment on the revolving credit facility, $2.1 million for tax payments of equity based compensation, and $0.9 million, net repayment on the floor plan payable balance. Cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended December 29, 2018 was $60.8 million, primarily as a result of distributions to Champion Holdings’ members of $65.3 million prior to completion of the Exchange and $2.2 million of additional payments made for deferred financing fees. The Company borrowed $46.9 million under the revolving credit agreement during the nine months ended December 29, 2018 and utilized the proceeds to repay term loans. Additionally, the Company borrowed $9.1 million from its floor plan financing arrangements.

See accompanying Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 5 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 1. Basis of Presentation and Business On June 1, 2018, Skyline Champion Corporation (formerly known as Skyline Corporation), an Indiana corporation (the “Company”) and Champion Enterprises Holdings, LLC (“Champion Holdings”) completed the transactions contemplated by the Share Contribution & Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”), dated as of January 5, 2018, by and between the Company and Champion Holdings. Under the Exchange Agreement, (i) Champion Holdings contributed to the Company all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of each of Champion Holdings’ wholly-owned operating subsidiaries (the “Contributed Shares”), and (ii) in exchange for the Contributed Shares, the Company issued to the members of Champion Holdings, in the aggregate, 47,752,008 shares of the Company common stock (“Skyline Common Stock”) (such issuance, the “Shares Issuance”). Immediately following the Shares Issuance, the members of Champion Holdings collectively held 84.5 %, and the Company’s pre-closing shareholders collectively held 15.5 %, of the issued and outstanding Skyline Common Stock on a fully-diluted basis. The contribution of the Contributed Shares by Champion Holdings to Skyline, and the Shares Issuance by the Company to the members of Champion Holdings are collectively referred to herein as the “Exchange.” The Exchange was treated as a purchase of the Company by Champion Holdings for accounting and financial reporting purposes. As a result, the financial results for the six months ending September 29, 2018 are comprised of 1) the results of Champion Holdings for the period between April 1, 2018 and May 31, 2018 and 2) the Company, after giving effect to the Exchange, from June 1, 2018 through September 29, 2018. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company, have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) for Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Article 10 of SEC Regulation S-X. Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“U.S. GAAP”) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany balances and transactions. In the opinion of management, these statements include all normal recurring adjustments necessary to fairly state the Company’s consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial position. The Company has evaluated subsequent events after the balance sheet date through the date of the filing of this report with the SEC. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the SEC on May 23, 2019. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) and condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations or cash flows for the full year. The Company’s fiscal year is a 52- or 53-week period that ends on the Saturday nearest to March 31. The Company’s current fiscal year, “fiscal 2020”, will end on March 28, 2020. References to “fiscal 2019” refer to the Company’s fiscal year ended March 30, 2019. The three and six months ended September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018 each included 13 weeks and 26 weeks, respectively. The Company’s operations consist of manufacturing, retail and transportation activities. The Company operates 33 manufacturing facilities throughout the United States (“U.S.”) and five manufacturing facilities in western Canada that primarily construct factory-built, timber-framed manufactured and modular houses that are sold primarily to independent retailers and builders/developers. The Company’s retail operations consist of 21 sales centers that sell manufactured houses to consumers primarily in the Southern U.S. The Company’s transportation business engages independent owners/drivers to transport recreational vehicles throughout the U.S. and Canada and manufactured houses in certain regions of the U.S. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements: In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (“ASC 842”), to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. A lessee should recognize in the consolidated balance sheet a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and an asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee have not significantly changed from previous requirements. This ASC 842 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2018 and modified retrospective application is permitted. The Company adopted ASC 842 as of March 31, 2019, the first day of fiscal 2020 using the modified retrospective approach and without restating comparative periods. The Company has elected to apply the transition package of three practical expedients which allow companies not to reassess whether agreements contain leases, the classification of leases, and the capitalization of initial direct costs. The Company did not elect the practical expedient which permits the use of hindsight when determining the lease term and assessing right-of-use assets for impairment. As permitted by the standard, the Company elected to: 1) recognize lease expense for leases with a term of 12 months or less on a straight-line basis over the lease term and will not recognize any right of use assets or lease liabilities for those leases, and 2) not separate lease and non-lease components. 6 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued The primary financial statement impact upon adoption was the recognition, on a discounted basis, of the Company's minimum commitments under non-cancelable operating leases as right of use assets and obligations on the consolidated balance sheets. The adoption of ASC 842 resulted in the recognition of lease-related assets and liabilities of $ 13.7 million. The standard did not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations or cash flows. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Pending Adoption: In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment . The standard simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairments and allows a goodwill impairment charge to be based on the amount of a reporting unit’s carrying value in excess of its fair value. This eliminates the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill or what is known as “Step 2” under the current guidance. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods of public entities beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. This guidance requires the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This guidance also requires enhanced disclosures regarding significant estimates and judgments used in estimating credit losses. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements. There were no other accounting standards recently issued that are expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations. 2. Business Combination The Exchange was completed on June 1, 2018 and was accounted for as a reverse acquisition under the acquisition method of accounting as provided by the FASB Accounting Standards Codification 805, Business Combinations. Champion Holdings was deemed to be the acquirer for accounting and financial reporting purposes. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed as a result of the Exchange were recorded at their respective fair values and added to the carrying value of Champion Holdings’ existing assets and liabilities. The Company incurred acquisition-related costs of approximately $ 0.5 million and $ 6.9 million for the three and six months ended September 29, 2018, respectively, which were classified as other expense in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. Additionally, the Company incurred approximately $ 6.0 million in stock compensation expense related to former Skyline employees during the first quarter of fiscal 2019, which is recorded in selling, general, and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. These types of costs were no t incurred during fiscal 2020. The purchase price of the acquisition was determined with reference to the value of equity (common stock) of the Company based on the closing price on June 1, 2018 of $ 33.39 per share. The purchase price has been allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed using their estimated fair values at June 1, 2018, the closing of the Exchange. The purchase price and the allocation have been used to prepare the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. The purchase price was allocated as follows: (Dollars in thousands) Cash $ 9,722 Trade accounts receivable 13,876 Inventory 19,028 Assets held for sale 2,086 Property, plant and equipment 40,220 Deferred tax assets, net 7,034 Other assets 6,706 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities ( 36,027 ) Intangibles 52,065 Goodwill 170,342 Total purchase price allocation $ 285,052 Goodwill is primarily attributable to expected synergies from the combination of the companies, including, but not limited to, expected cost synergies through procurement activities and operational improvements through sharing of best practices. Goodwill, which is not deductible for income tax purposes, was allocated to the U.S. Factory-built Housing reporting unit. Cash, trade receivables, other assets, accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities were generally stated at historical carrying values given the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities. Intangible assets consist primarily of amounts recognized for the fair value of customer relationships and trade names and were based on an independent appraisal. Customer-based assets include the Company’s established relationships with its customers and the ability of those customers to generate future economic profits for the Company. The Company estimates that these intangible assets have a weighted average useful life of ten years . Fair value estimates of property, plant, and equipment were based on independent appraisals and broker opinions of value, giving consideration to the highest and best use of the assets. Key assumptions used in the 7 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued appraisals were based on a combination of market and cost approaches, as appropriate. Level 3 fair value estimates of $ 40.2 million related to property, plant , and equipment and $ 52.1 million related to intangible assets were rec ognized in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as a result of the allocation of the purchase price from the Exchange . The Company determined $ 2.1 million of property acquired in the Exchange met the definition of held for sale at the acquisition date and was classified in other current assets . The fair value less cost to sell of this held for sale property is evaluated each reporting period to determine if it has changed. A loss of $ 1.0 million was recorded during the first quarter of fiscal 2020 related to this held for sale property based on updated market information . Assets held for sale were $ 1.1 million and $ 2.1 million as of September 28, 2019 and March 30, 2019, respectively. For further information on acquired assets measured at fair value, see Note 5 , Goodwill and Intangible Assets . The Company allocated a portion of the purchase price to certain realizable deferred tax assets totaling $ 27.3 million. Deferred tax assets are primarily federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and credits offset by a valuation allowance for certain state net operating loss carryforwards that are not expected to be realized. The deferred tax assets are offset by deferred tax liabilities of $ 20.3 million resulting from the purchase price allocation step-up in fair value that exceed the historical tax basis. The statement of operations for the three and six months ended September 29, 2018 includes $ 68.0 and $ 90.1 million, respectively, of net sales attributable to the acquired Skyline operations. A summary of the results of operations for the Company, on an as reported and on a pro forma basis, are as follows: Six Months Ended September 29, 2018 (Dollars in thousands) Reported Pro forma Net sales $ 677,697 $ 723,501 Net loss ( 77,878 ) ( 62,769 ) The pro forma results are based on adding the historical results of operations of Champion Holdings and Skyline and adjusting those historical amounts for the amortization of intangibles created in the Exchange; the increase in depreciation as a result of the step-up in fair value of property, plant, and equipment; removing transaction costs directly associated with the Exchange; removing equity-based compensation expense directly resulting from the Exchange; reflecting the financing arrangements entered into in connection with the Exchange, and adjusting those items for income taxes. The pro forma disclosures do not give effect to the potential impact of current financial conditions, any anticipated synergies, operating efficiencies or cost savings that may result from the Exchange or any integration costs. The pro forma data is intended for informational purposes and is not indicative of the future results of operations. The Exchange Agreement provided that Champion Holdings was permitted to pay a capital distribution prior to completion of the Exchange to the extent it had cash in excess of debt and other debt-like items and unpaid Exchange fees and expenses. Prior to the completion of the Exchange, Champion Holdings made a capital distribution to its members equal to an aggregate of $ 65.3 million (of which $ 22.5 million was reflected as a reduction to retained earnings and $ 42.8 million was reflected as a reduction to members’ contributed capital). 3 . Inventories The components of inventory, net of reserves for obsolete inventory, were as follows: (Dollars in thousands) September 28, 2019 March 30, 2019 Raw materials $ 50,259 $ 48,531 Work in process 13,682 13,973 Finished goods and other 49,122 60,134 Total inventories $ 113,063 $ 122,638 At September 28, 2019 and March 30, 2019, reserves for obsolete inventory were $ 4.0 million and $ 4.1 million, respectively. 4 . Property, Plant, and Equipment Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated primarily on the straight-line method, generally over the following estimated useful lives: land improvements – 3 to 10 years ; buildings and improvements – 8 to 25 years ; and vehicles and machinery and equipment – 3 to 8 years . Depreciation expense for the three months ended September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018 was $3.6 million and $ 2.8 million, respectively. Depreciation expense for the six months ended September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018 was $ 6.7 million and $ 5.3 million, respectively. 8 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued The components of property, plant, and equipment were as follows: (Dollars in thousands) September 28, 2019 March 30, 2019 Land and improvements $ 35,380 $ 34,264 Buildings and improvements 86,738 83,973 Machinery and equipment 48,054 42,476 Construction in progress 3,821 3,619 Property, plant and equipment, at cost 173,993 164,332 Less: accumulated depreciation ( 62,565 ) ( 55,745 ) Property, plant, and equipment, net $ 111,428 $ 108,587 5 . Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. At September 28, 2019 and March 30, 2019, the Company had goodwill of $ 173.5 million and $ 173.4 million, respectively. The change from March 30, 2019 was a result of the finalization of the allocation of net assets recognized in connection with the Exchange. Intangible Assets The components of amortizable intangible assets were as follows: (Dollars in thousands) September 28, 2019 March 30, 2019 Customer Relationships Trade Names Total Customer Relationships Trade Names Total Gross carrying amount $ 48,674 $ 13,192 $ 61,866 $ 48,782 $ 13,173 $ 61,955 Accumulated amortization ( 11,274 ) ( 4,533 ) ( 15,807 ) ( 9,052 ) ( 3,967 ) ( 13,019 ) Amortizable intangibles, net $ 37,400 $ 8,659 $ 46,059 $ 39,730 $ 9,206 $ 48,936 The Company recognized finite-lived intangibles for customer relationships of $ 43.1 million and trade names of $ 9.0 million as a result of the allocation of the purchase price from the Exchange. The fair value of the customer relationship intangible asset was estimated using the multi-period excess earnings method of the income approach. The fair value of the customer relationship intangible asset was determined based on estimates and assumptions of projected cash flows attributable to the acquired customer relationships, the annual attrition rate of existing customer relationships, the contributory asset charges attributable to the assets that support the customer relationships, such as net working capital, property, plant, and equipment, trade name, and workforce, the economic life and the discount rate as determined at the time of the final valuation. The fair value of the trade name intangible asset was estimated using the relief-from-royalty method of the income approach. The fair value of the trade names intangible asset was determined based on estimates and assumptions used for the expected life of the intangible asset, the royalty rate and the discount rate that reflects the level of risk associated with the future cash flows as determined at the time of the final valuation. During the three months ended September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018, amortization of intangible assets was $ 1.3 million and $ 1.2 million, respectively. During the six months ended September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018, amortization of intangible assets was $ 2.7 million and $ 1.7 million, respectively. 6 .

The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility of up to $ 100.0 million, including a letter of credit sub-facility of not less than $ 45.0 million. Initial borrowings under the Credit Agreement were used to repay the Company’s existing $ 46.9 million term loans (“Term Loans”) and replace the Company’s existing cash collateralized stand-alone letter of credit facility. The revolving credit facility allows the Company to draw down, repay and re-draw loans on the available funds during the term of the Credit Agreement. During the three and six months ended September 28, 2019, the Company repaid $ 5.0 million and $ 10.0 million, respectively, of amounts previously drawn on the revolving credit facility. The Credit Agreement matures on June 5, 2023 and has no scheduled amortization. The interest rate under the Credit Agreement adjusts based on the first lien net leverage of the Company from a high of LIBOR plus 2.25 % and ABR plus 1.25 % when the first lien net leverage is equal to or greater than 2 .00:1.00, to a low of LIBOR plus 1.50 % and ABR plus 0.50 % when the first lien net leverage is below 0.50:1.00. In addition, the Company is obligated to pay an unused line fee ranging between 0.40 % and 0.25 % (depending on the first lien net leverage) in respect of unused commitments under the Credit Agreement. At September 28, 2019 the interest rate on borrowings under the Credit Agreement was 3.57 %. At September 28, 2019, letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement totaled $ 28.7 million. Total available borrowings under the Credit Agreement as of September 28, 2019 were $ 39.4 million. Obligations under industrial revenue bonds are supported by letters of credit and bear interest based on a municipal bond index rate. The weighted-average interest rate at September 28, 2019, including related costs and fees, was 3.69 %. At March 30, 2019, the weighted average interest rate was 3.62 %. The industrial revenue bonds require lump-sum payments of principal upon maturity in 2029 . The Credit Agreement contains covenants that restrict the amount of additional debt, liens and certain payments, including equity buybacks, investments, dispositions, mergers and consolidations, among other restrictions as defined. The Company was in compliance with all covenants of the Credit Agreement as of September 28, 2019. Floor Plan Payable The Company’s retail operations utilize floor plan financing to fund the acquisition of manufactured homes for display or resale. At September 28, 2019 and March 30, 2019, the Company had outstanding borrowings on floor plan financing agreements of $ 30.5 million and $ 33.3 million, respectively. Total credit line capacity provided under the agreements was $ 47.0 million as of September 28, 2019. Borrowings are secured by the homes and are required to be repaid when the Company sells the home to a customer. 10 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued 9 .

Leases The Company has operating leases for land, manufacturing and office facilities, and equipment. The Company's lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such option. The Company's leases do not contain material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease terms. Lease expense included in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of operations is shown below: (Dollars in thousands) Three Months Ended September 28, 2019 Six Months Ended September 28, 2019 Operating lease expense $ 1,470 $ 2,875 Short-term lease expense 230 603 Total lease expense $ 1,700 $ 3,478 Operating lease assets and obligations included in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet are shown below: (Dollars in thousands) September 28, 2019 Right-of-use assets under operating leases: Other long-term assets $ 12,712 Lease obligations under operating leases: Other current liabilities 4,073 Other long-term liabilities 8,639 Total lease obligation $ 12,712 Maturities of lease obligations as of September 28, 2019, are shown below: (Dollars in thousands) September 28, 2019 Fiscal 2020 (1) $ 2,500 Fiscal 2021 4,151 Fiscal 2022 3,086 Fiscal 2023 2,232 Fiscal 2024 909 Thereafter 2,213 Total undiscounted cash flows 15,091 Less: imputed interest ( 2,379 ) Lease obligations under operating leases $ 12,712 (1) For remaining period in fiscal year. The weighted average lease term and discount rate for operating leases are shown below: September 28, 2019 Weighted average remaining lease term (in years) 5.1 Weighted average discount rate 5.6 The discount rate used to measure a lease obligation should be the rate implicit in the lease; however, the Company’s operating leases generally do not provide an implicit rate. Accordingly, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate at lease commencement to determine the present value of lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is an entity-specific rate which represents the rate of interest a lessee would pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term with similar payments. Cash flow information related to operating leases is shown below: (Dollars in thousands) Six Months Ended September 28, 2019 Non-cash activity: Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for operating lease obligations $ 1,606 Operating cash flows: Cash paid related to operating lease obligations $ 2,958 12 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued 1 1 . Income Taxes For the three months ended September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018, the Company recorded $ 7.5 million and $ 5.8 million of income tax expense and had an effective tax rate of 29.8 % and ( 8.2 %), respectively. For the six months ended September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018, the Company recorded $ 14.2 million and $ 9.3 million of income tax expense and had an effective tax rate of 28.7 % and ( 13.5 %), respectively. The change in the effective tax rate for the three and six months ended September 28, 2019, compared with the same respective periods of the prior year, was primarily due to costs related to the Exchange for which no tax benefit could be recognized. The Company’s effective tax rate for the three and six months ended September 28, 2019 differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of 21.0 % due primarily to the effect of non-deductible expenses, state and local income taxes and results in foreign jurisdictions. The Company’s effective tax rate for the three and six months ended September 29, 2018 differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of non-deductible expenses, state and local income taxes, one-time charges related to the Exchange and results in foreign jurisdictions and non-taxable entities. During the six months ended September 28, 2019, the Company’s uncertain tax position did not change. During the six months ended September 29, 2018, the Company’s uncertain tax position decreased by $ 0.4 million due to expiration of certain statutes of limitations. The Company estimates no material changes to uncertain tax benefits in the next twelve months. The Company records interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense. Net interest and penalties for the periods presented herein were not significant. 1 2 . Earnings Per Share Basic net income (loss) per share (“EPS”) attributable to the Company was computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to the Company by the average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Certain of the Company’s time-vesting restricted share awards are considered participating securities. Diluted earnings per common share is computed based on the more dilutive of (i) the two-class method, assuming the participating securities are not exercised or converted; or (ii) the summation of average common shares outstanding and additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential common shares had been issued. During the three and six months ended September 28, 2019, the two-class method was more dilutive and was not applicable to the September 29, 2018 computation given the net loss recorded for the three and six months ended September 29, 2018. The number of shares used to calculate earnings per share prior to the Exchange was determined based on the exchange ratio, as defined in the Exchange Agreement. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share: Three Months Ended Six Months Ended (Dollars and shares in thousands, except per share data) September 28, 2019 September 29, 2018 September 28, 2019 September 29, 2018 Numerator: Net income (loss) $ 17,745 $ ( 77,025 ) $ 35,125 $ ( 77,878 ) Undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities ( 65 ) — ( 154 ) — Net income (loss) attributable to the Company's common shareholders $ 17,680 $ ( 77,025 ) $ 34,971 $ ( 77,878 ) Denominator: Basic weighted average shares outstanding 56,481 54,105 56,424 50,747 Dilutive securities 243 — 233 — Diluted weighted average shares outstanding 56,724 54,105 56,657 50,747 Basic net income (loss) per share $ 0.31 $ ( 1.42 ) $ 0.62 $ ( 1.53 ) Diluted net income (loss) per share $ 0.31 $ ( 1.42 ) $ 0.62 $ ( 1.53 ) 1 3 . Transactions with Related Parties Prior to the Exchange, the Company was party to a Management Advisory Services Agreement (“Services Agreement”) with Centerbridge Advisors, LLC; MAK Management L.P.; and Sankaty Advisors, LLC (collectively, the “Managers”), affiliates of which collectively owned a majority of the units of Champion Holdings and the Company’s common stock (the “Principal Shareholders”), whereby the Principal Shareholders provided management, consulting, financial and other advisory services to Champion Holdings. Management fee expense during fiscal 2019, recognized prior to the Exchange, was $ 0.3 million. The Services Agreement was terminated in connection with the Exchange. The Management fee expense is included in selling, general, and administrative expenses in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operation. 13 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued 1 4 . Segment Information Financial results for the Company's reportable segments have been prepared using a management approach, which is consistent with the basis and manner in which financial information is evaluated by the Company's chief operating decision maker in allocating resources and in assessing performance. The Company’s chief operating decision maker, the Chief Executive Officer, evaluates the performance of the Company’s segment primarily based on net sales, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) and operating assets. The Company operates in two reportable segments: (i) U.S. Factory-built Housing, which includes manufacturing and retail housing operations and (ii) Canadian Factory-built Housing. Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation operations, corporate costs directly incurred for all segments and intersegment eliminations. Segments are generally determined by geography. Segment data includes intersegment revenues and corporate office costs that are directly and exclusively incurred for each segment. Total assets for Corporate/Other primarily include cash and certain deferred tax items not specifically allocated to another segment. Selected financial information by reportable segment was as follows: Three Months Ended Six Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) September 28, 2019 September 29, 2018 September 28, 2019 September 29, 2018 Net sales: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 312,830 $ 306,615 $ 644,435 $ 572,739 Canadian Factory-built Housing 26,407 25,401 50,107 52,755 Corporate/Other 15,221 23,420 31,804 52,203 Consolidated net sales $ 354,458 $ 355,436 $ 726,346 $ 677,697 Operating income: U.S. Factory-built Housing EBITDA $ 35,314 $ 26,687 $ 71,459 $ 49,603 Canadian Factory-built Housing EBITDA 4,244 3,035 7,299 6,555 Corporate/Other EBITDA ( 8,998 ) ( 94,744 ) ( 19,406 ) ( 108,197 ) Depreciation ( 3,545 ) ( 2,845 ) ( 6,655 ) ( 5,275 ) Amortization ( 1,362 ) ( 1,202 ) ( 2,724 ) ( 1,683 ) Consolidated operating income $ 25,653 $ ( 69,069 ) $ 49,973 $ ( 58,997 ) Depreciation: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 3,068 $ 2,415 $ 5,706 $ 4,460 Canadian Factory-built Housing 247 227 489 458 Corporate/Other 230 203 460 357 Consolidated depreciation $ 3,545 $ 2,845 $ 6,655 $ 5,275 Amortization of intangible assets: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 1,362 $ 1,142 $ 2,724 $ 1,562 Canadian Factory-built Housing — 60 — 121 Corporate/Other — — — — Consolidated amortization of intangible assets $ 1,362 $ 1,202 $ 2,724 $ 1,683 Capital expenditures: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 4,144 $ 2,176 $ 7,502 $ 3,456 Canadian Factory-built Housing 317 204 428 414 Corporate/Other 422 285 1,479 814 Consolidated capital expenditures $ 4,883 $ 2,665 $ 9,409 $ 4,684 (Dollars in thousands) September 28, 2019 March 30, 2019 Total Assets: U.S. Factory-built Housing (1) $ 491,699 $ 488,878 Canadian Factory-built Housing (1) 62,879 59,260 Corporate/Other (1) 176,972 151,816 Consolidated total assets $ 731,550 $ 699,954 14 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued (1) Deferred tax assets for the Canadian operations are reflected in the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment. U.S. deferred tax assets are presented in Corporate/Other because an allocation between segments is not practicable. 1 5 . Commitments, Contingencies and Legal Proceedings Repurchase Contingencies and Guarantees The Company is contingently liable under terms of repurchase agreements with lending institutions that provide wholesale floor plan financing to retailers. These arrangements, which are customary in the manufactured housing industry, provide for the repurchase of products sold to retailers in the event of default by the retailer on their agreement to pay the financial institution. The risk of loss from these agreements is spread over numerous retailers. The repurchase price is generally determined by the original sales price of the product and pre-defined curtailment arrangements. The Company accounts for the guarantees under its repurchase agreements with the retailers’ financing institutions by estimating and deferring a portion of the related product sale that represents the estimated fair value of the repurchase obligation. The estimated fair value takes into account the estimate of the loss the Company will incur upon resale of any repurchases. This estimate is based on recent historical experience supplemented by management’s assessment of current economic and other conditions affecting the Company’s retailers. The reserve for estimated losses under repurchase agreements was $ 0.9 million at September 28, 2019 and $ 1.0 million at March 30, 2019. Excluding the resale value of the homes, the contingent repurchase obligation as of September 28, 2019 was estimated to be approximately $ 157.4 million. Losses incurred on homes repurchased were immaterial during each of the three and six months ended September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018. In addition to the repurchase agreements, the Company has agreed to guarantee from 3 % to 50 % of certain retailers’ outstanding loans to a floor plan lender. At September 28, 2019, those guarantees totaled $ 0.7 million of which $ 0.5 million was outstanding. At September 28, 2019, the Company was contingently obligated for approximately $ 28.7 million under letters of credit, primarily consisting of $ 12.7 million to support long-term debt, $ 15.7 million to support the casualty insurance program, and $ 0.3 million to support bonding agreements. The letters of credit are backed by a sub-facility under the New Credit Agreement. The Company was also contingently obligated for $ 24.1 million under surety bonds, generally to support performance on long-term construction contracts and license and service bonding requirements. In the normal course of business, the Company’s former subsidiaries that operated in the United Kingdom historically provided certain guarantees to two customers. Those guarantees provide contractual liability for proven construction defects up to 12 years from the date of delivery of certain products. The guarantees remain a contingent liability of the Company which declines over time through October 2027. As of the date of this report, the Company expects few, if any, claims to be reported under the terms of the guarantees. Legal Proceedings The Company has agreed to indemnify counterparties in the ordinary course of its business in agreements to acquire and sell business assets and in financing arrangements. The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of its business. As of the date of this filing, the Company believes the ultimate liability with respect to these contingent obligations will not have, either individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 15 Item 2. MANAGEMENT’ S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following should be read in conjunction with Skyline Champion Corporation’s condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear in Item I of this Report. Overview On June 1, 2018, Skyline Champion Corporation (the “Company”) was formed by Skyline Corporation (“Skyline”) and Champion Enterprises Holdings, LLC (“Champion”) combining their operations pursuant to the Share Contribution & Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”), dated as of January 5, 2018, by and between Skyline and Champion Holdings, as described in further detail below. Champion Holdings was formed as a Delaware limited liability company in 2010. Skyline was originally incorporated in Indiana in 1959. The Company is a leading producer of factory-built housing in the U.S. and Canada. The Company serves as a complete solutions provider across complementary and vertically integrated businesses including manufactured offsite construction, company-owned retail locations, and transportation logistics services. The Company is the largest independent publicly traded factory-built solutions provider in North America based on revenue and markets its homes under several nationally recognized brand names including Skyline Homes, Champion Home Builders, Genesis Homes, Athens Park Models, Dutch Housing, Excel Homes, Homes of Merit, New Era, Redman Homes, Shore Park, Silvercrest, Titan Homes in the U.S. and Moduline and SRI Homes in western Canada. The Company operates 33 manufacturing facilities throughout the U.S. and five manufacturing facilities in western Canada that primarily construct factory-built, timber-framed manufactured and modular houses that are sold primarily to independent retailers, builders/developers, and manufactured home community operators. The Company’s retail operations consist of 21 sales centers that sell manufactured homes to consumers primarily in the southern U.S. The Company’s transportation business engages independent owners/drivers to transport manufactured homes and recreational vehicles throughout the U.S. and Canada. Acquisitions and Expansions Over the last several years, market demand for the Company’s products, primarily affordable housing in the U.S., has continued to improve. As a result, the Company has focused on operational improvements to make existing manufacturing facilities more profitable as well as executing measured expansion of its manufacturing and retail footprint. In response to the increasing demand for factory-built housing in the U.S., the Company has increased capacity through strategic acquisitions and expansions of its manufacturing footprint. The Company is focused on growing in strong HUD-markets across the U.S. as well as further expanding into the Northeast and Midwest U.S. modular housing markets. During June 2019, the Company began production at its newest manufactured housing facility in Leesville, Louisiana. During fiscal 2019, the Company completed its expansion of its Corona, California facility by adding a second production line and expanded its Leola, Pennsylvania campus by adding an additional plant. Production at the Leola facility began in April 2019. The Exchange added eight plants to the Company’s manufacturing footprint in fiscal 2019 (described in more detail below). In April 2017, the Company completed the purchase of a factory-built housing plant in Mansfield, Texas. In January 2017, the Company restarted operations at the Liverpool, Pennsylvania location, which was one of five modular manufacturing facilities acquired through a series of transactions with Innovative Building Systems, LLC and its subsidiaries. (“IBS” or the “IBS Acquisition”). The other facilities acquired from IBS are idle and provide the Company with opportunity to add capacity. The Company has also focused on expansion of its company-owned retail operations, opening three additional retail sales centers during fiscal 2018 and five during fiscal 2017. Management believes retail expansion provides an opportunity to increase the Company’s presence in market segments that are not currently served through its independent retail network, while also providing for expansion and increased utilization of existing manufacturing operations. These acquisitions and investments are part of a strategy to grow and diversify revenue with a focus on increasing the Company’s HUD and modular homebuilding presence in the U.S. as well as improving the results of operations. These acquisitions and investments are included in the consolidated results for periods subsequent to their respective acquisition dates. Combination with Skyline On January 5, 2018, Champion Holdings and Skyline entered into an Exchange Agreement pursuant to which the two companies agreed to combine their operations. The Exchange was completed on June 1, 2018 and was accounted for as a reverse acquisition under the acquisition method of accounting as provided by FASB Accounting Standards Codification 805, Business Combinations (“ASC 805”). Champion Holdings was determined to be the acquirer for accounting and financial reporting purposes. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed by Champion Holdings as a result of the Exchange were recorded at their respective fair values and added to the carrying value of Champion Holdings existing assets and liabilities. As Champion Holdings is the accounting acquirer, the Company’s financial results for the six months ending September 29, 2018 are comprised of 1) the results of Champion Holdings for the period between April 1, 2018 and May 31, 2018 and 2) the Company, after giving effect to the Exchange, from June 1, 2018 through September 29, 2018. 16 Industry and Company Outlook For the six months ended September 28, 2019, approximately 77% of the Company’s U.S. manufacturing sales were generated from the manufacture of homes that comply with the Federal HUD-code construction standard in the U.S. Industry shipments of HUD-code homes were 62,471 during the eight months ended August 31, 2019 compared to 66,721 units shipped in same period of the prior year. The Company’s HUD market share during those periods was 17.1% versus 14.4% in the comparable period of the prior year. Industry sales of HUD-code homes have increased since 2009, when 50,000 HUD-code homes were sold. Fewer factory-built homes were sold in 2009 than in any year since 1959. While HUD-code factory-built home shipments have improved modestly over the past few years, the industry continues to operate at relatively low levels compared to historical shipment statistics. For instance, the long-term average for manufactured home shipments since 1960 is approximately 222,000 units per year. For the six months ended September 28, 2019, approximately 16% of the Company’s U.S. manufacturing sales were modular. The industry reports U.S. modular market shipments quarterly and three months in arrears. Industry shipments of modular homes in the U.S. were 6,916 during the first half of calendar year 2019, which was 9.9% lower than the 7,673 units shipped in the comparable period of the prior year. The Company’s modular market share during these periods was 14.1% and 11.5%, respectively. Modular home sales across the industry have generally been stable since 2009.

The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. U.S. Factory-built Housing: Sales of homes for the Company’s U.S. manufacturing and retail operations increased by $6.2 million, or 2.0%. The improvement was due to a 2.3% increase in average home selling prices resulting from a shift in product mix. Product mix fluctuations result from consumer preferences regarding the size and styles of homes selected for purchase, as well as opting for home upgrade packages as well as regional housing dynamics. Canadian Factory-built Housing: The Canadian Factory-built Housing segment net sales increased by $1.0 million, or 4.0% for the three months ended September 28, 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase was due to a 4.3% increase in average home selling price resulting from a shift in product mix. Net sales for the Canadian segment were unfavorably impacted by approximately $0.6 million as the Canadian dollar weakened compared to the U.S. dollar during the second quarter of fiscal 2020 as compared to the same period of the prior year. Corporate/Other: Net sales for Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation business and the elimination of intersegment sales. For the three months ended September 28, 2019, net sales decreased $8.2 million, or 35.0%. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower net sales in the Company’s transportation business primarily as a result of lower shipments associated with reduced RV demand in the U.S. GROSS PROFIT The following table summarizes gross profit for the three months ended September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018 : Three Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) September 28, 2019 September 29, 2018 Change % Change Gross profit: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 65,361 $ 50,706 $ 14,655 28.9 % Canadian Factory-built Housing 5,953 4,588 1,365 29.8 % Corporate/Other 2,741 3,706 (965 ) (26.0 %) Total gross profit $ 74,055 $ 59,000 $ 15,055 25.5 % Gross profit as a percent of net sales 20.9 % 16.6 % Gross profit as a percent of sales during the three months ended September 28, 2019 was 20.9% compared to 16.6% during three months ended September 29, 2018. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. 18 U.S. Factory-built Housing: Gross profit for the U.S. Factory-built Housing segment increased by $14.7 million, or 28.9%, during the three months ended September 28, 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year. Gross profit was 20.9% as a percent of segment net sales for the three months ended September 28, 2019 compared to 16.5% in the same period of the prior year. Gross profit expansion was driven by material cost inputs, Exchange synergy capture, rationalization of product offerings and plant operating improvements. These improvements were partially offset by the production ramp costs for capacity expansion at a recently opened manufacturing facility. Canadian Factory-built Housing: Gross profit for the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment increased $1.4 million, or 29.8%, during the three months ended September 28, 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year. Gross profit as a percent of net segment sales was 22.5% for the three months ended September 28, 2019, compared to 18.1% in the same period of the prior year. Gross margin increased due to product mix, lower material commodity pricing, and efforts to reduce fixed expenses during slower economic market cycles. Corporate/Other: Gross profit for the Corporate/Other segment decreased $1.0 million, or 26.0%, during the three months ended September 28, 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year. However, Corporate/Other gross profit improved as a percent of segment net sales to 18.0% from 15.8%. Gross margins for the Company’s transportation business improved as a percent of sales due in part to less brokered business to other providers at lower margins in response to the decline in revenue caused by the softening of market demand for RVs. SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Selling, general, and administrative expenses include foreign currency transaction gains and losses, equity compensation, and intangible amortization expense. The following table summarizes selling, general, and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018: Three Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) September 28, 2019 September 29, 2018 Change % Change Selling, general, and administrative expenses: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 34,476 $ 26,494 $ 7,982 30.1 % Canadian Factory-built Housing 1,956 1,840 116 6.3 % Corporate/Other 11,970 99,735 (87,765 ) (88.0 %) Total selling, general, and administrative expenses $ 48,402 $ 128,069 $ (79,667 ) (62.2 %) Selling, general, and administrative expense as a percent of net sales 13.7 % 36.0 % Selling, general, and administrative expenses were $48.4 million for the three months ended September 28, 2019, a decrease of $79.7 million compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to stock compensation expense recognized in the prior year, as explained further below. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. U.S. Factory-built Housing: Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the U.S. Factory-built Housing segment increased $8.0 million, or 30.1%, during the three months ended September 28, 2019 as compared to the same period in the prior year. Selling, general, and administrative expenses, as a percent of segment net sales, was 11.0% for the three months ended September 28, 2019 compared to 8.6% during the comparable period in the prior year. The increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses was a combination of factors which include (i) higher sales commissions and incentive compensation, which is generally based on sales volume or a measure of profitability; (ii) an increase in salaries and benefits to maintain competitive compensation packages to retain and recruit team members; and (iii) investment in capacity expansion at a newly opened manufacturing facility. Canadian Factory-built Housing: Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment increased $0.1 million, or 6.3%, during the three months ended September 28, 2019 as compared to the same period of the prior year. As a percent of segment net sales, selling, general, and administrative expenses for the Canadian segment was 7.4% for the three months ended September 28, 2019 compared to 7.2% for the same period in the prior year. The increase is primarily due to higher sales commissions and incentive compensation, which is generally based on sales volume or a measure of profitability. 19 Corporate/Other: Selling, general, and administrative expenses for Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation operations, corporate costs incurred for all segments and intersegment eliminations. Selling, general, and administrative expenses for Corporate/Other decreased $87.8 million, or 88.0%, during the three months ended September 28, 2019 as compared to the same period of the prior year. The decrease is mainly related to stock compensation expense recognized in the prior year triggered by the secondary offerings which closed during the second quarter of fiscal 2019 of $85.8 million, as well as a reduction in acquisition integration costs and restructuring costs of $2.7 million. INTEREST EXPENSE, NET The following table summarizes the components of interest expense, net for the three months ended September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018: Three Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) September 28, 2019 September 29, 2018 Change % Change Interest expense $ 1,195 $ 1,197 $ (2 ) (0.2 %) Interest income (813 ) (370 ) (443 ) 119.7 % Interest expense, net $ 382 $ 827 $ (445 ) (53.8 %) Average outstanding floor plan payable $ 31,284 $ 28,745 Average outstanding long-term debt $ 48,080 $ 59,422 Interest expense, net was $0.4 million for the three months ended September 28, 2019, a decrease of $0.4 million compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease was related to: (i) higher interest income recognized during the period as a result of higher average cash balances invested in short term facilities and (ii) a lower average outstanding balance on its credit facility as compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease was offset by increased interest expense on the floor plan payable balances due to a higher average outstanding balance as compared to the same period in the prior year, as well as an increase in the effective interest rate on the borrowings. OTHER EXPENSE The following table summarizes other expense for the three months ended September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018: Three Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) September 28, 2019 September 29, 2018 Change % Change Other expense $ — $ 1,307 $ (1,307 ) (100.0 %) Other expense for the three months ended September 29, 2018 related to legal, accounting, and advisory services associated with the secondary offerings of $0.8 million and the Exchange of $0.5 million. INCOME TAX EXPENSE The following table summarizes income tax expense for the three months ended September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018: Three Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) September 28, 2019 September 29, 2018 Change % Change Income tax expense $ 7,526 $ 5,822 $ 1,704 29.3 % Effective tax rate 29.8 % (8.2 %) Income tax expense for the three months ended September 28, 2019 was $7.5 million, representing an effective tax rate of 29.8%, compared to income tax expense of $5.8 million, representing an effective tax rate of (8.2%), for the three months ended September 29, 2018. The Company’s effective tax rate for the three months ended September 28, 2019 differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of 21.0%, due primarily to the effect of non-deductible expenses, state and local income taxes, and results in foreign jurisdictions. The Company’s effective tax rate for the three months ended September 29, 2018 differed from the federal statutory rate of 21.0% primarily due to the effect of non-deductible expenses, state and local income taxes, one-time charges related to the Exchange and results of operations in foreign jurisdictions and non-taxable entities. 20 ADJUSTED EBITDA The following table reconciles net income, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, to Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the three months ended September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018: Three Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) September 28, 2019 September 29, 2018 Change % Change Net income (loss) $ 17,745 $ (77,025 ) $ 94,770 * Income tax expense 7,526 5,822 1,704 29.3 % Interest expense, net 382 827 (445 ) (53.8 %) Depreciation and amortization 4,907 4,047 860 21.3 % Equity-based compensation (for awards granted prior to December 31, 2018) 1,534 85,839 (84,305 ) (98.2 %) Foreign currency transaction (gain) loss 47 (34 ) 81 * Transaction costs — 492 (492 ) * Acquisition integration costs 340 2,313 (1,973 ) (85.3 %) Equity-offering costs — 816 (816 ) * Restructuring costs and other 1 702 (701 ) * Adjusted EBITDA $ 32,482 $ 23,799 $ 8,683 36.5 % * indicates that the calculated percentage is not meaningful Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended September 28, 2019 was $32.5 million, an increase of $8.7 million from the same period of the prior year.

The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. 22 U.S. Factory-built Housing: The U.S. Factory-built Housing segment accounted for the Company’s net sales growth for the six months ended September 28, 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year. Sales of homes for the Company’s U.S. manufacturing and retail operations increased by $71.7 million, or 12.5%. The number of homes sold during the six months ended September 28, 2019 increased by 887 units, or 9.3%. Net sales increased by $50.3 million due to the inclusion of the Skyline operations for all six months in the first half of fiscal 2020 compared to the same period of the prior year which only included four months of Skyline operations. The remainder of the increase was due to a combination of factors which included additional manufacturing capacity, plant operating improvements, and an increase in the average home selling price which was driven primarily by product mix. Product mix fluctuations result from consumer preferences regarding the sizes and styles of homes selected for purchase, and opting for home upgrade packages as well as regional housing dynamics. Canadian Factory-built Housing: The Canadian Factory-built Housing segment net sales decreased by $2.6 million, or 5.0% for the six months ended September 28, 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a 11.6% decrease in number of homes sold, partially offset by a 7.4% increase in average home selling price which was a result of pricing actions taken by the Company as well as shifts in product mix. The number of homes sold decreased due to the decline in manufactured housing demand in the British Columbia and Alberta provinces versus the same period in the prior year. On a constant currency basis, net sales for the Canadian segment were unfavorably impacted by approximately $1.3 million as the Canadian dollar weakened compared to the U.S. dollar during the first half of fiscal 2020 as compared to the same period of the prior year. Corporate/Other: Net sales for Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation business and the elimination of intersegment sales. For the six months ended September 28, 2019, net sales decreased $20.4 million, or 39.1%. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower net sales in the Company’s transportation business primarily as a result of lower shipments associated with reduced RV demand in the U.S. GROSS PROFIT The following table summarizes gross profit for the six months ended September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018: Six Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) September 28, 2019 September 29, 2018 Change % Change Gross profit: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 133,676 $ 96,029 $ 37,647 39.2 % Canadian Factory-built Housing 10,579 9,942 637 6.4 % Corporate/Other 5,835 8,189 (2,354 ) (28.7 %) Total gross profit $ 150,090 $ 114,160 $ 35,930 31.5 % Gross profit as a percent of net sales 20.7 % 16.8 % Gross profit as a percent of sales during the six months ended September 28, 2019 was 20.7% compared to 16.8% during six months ended September 29, 2018. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. U.S. Factory-built Housing: Gross profit for the U.S. Factory-built Housing segment increased by $37.6 million, or 39.2%, during the six months ended September 28, 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in gross profit is due to the increase in sales volumes and improved margins. Gross profit was 20.7% as a percent of segment net sales for the six months ended September 28, 2019 compared to 16.8% in the same period of the prior year. Gross profit expansion was driven by favorable material pricing, refinement of product offerings, plant operating improvements, and procurement and operational synergies related to the Exchange, all of which were partially offset by labor inflation. Canadian Factory-built Housing: Gross profit for the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment increased $0.6 million, or 6.4%, during the six months ended September 28, 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year. Gross profit as a percent of net sales was 21.1% for the six months ended September 28, 2019, compared to 18.8% in the same period of the prior year. Gross margin increased due to product mix, lower material commodity pricing, and efforts to reduce fixed expenses during slower economic market cycles. 23 Corporate/Other: Gross profit for the Corporate/Other segment decreased $2.4 million, or 28.7%, during the six months ended September 28, 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year due to lower sales volume. Corporate/Other gross profit improved as a percent of segment net sales to 18.3% from 15.7%. Gross margins for the Company’s transportation business improved as a percent of sales due in part to less brokered business to other providers at lower margins in response to the decline in revenue caused by the softening of market demand for RVs. SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Selling, general, and administrative expenses include foreign currency transaction gains and losses, equity compensation and intangible amortization expense. The following table summarizes selling, general, and administrative expenses for the six months ended September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018: Six Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) September 28, 2019 September 29, 2018 Change % Change Selling, general, and administrative expenses: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 70,647 $ 51,005 $ 19,642 38.5 % Canadian Factory-built Housing 3,769 3,966 (197 ) (5.0 %) Corporate/Other 25,701 118,186 (92,485 ) (78.3 %) Total selling, general, and administrative expenses $ 100,117 $ 173,157 $ (73,040 ) (42.2 %) Selling, general, and administrative expense as a percent of net sales 13.8 % 25.6 % Selling, general, and administrative expenses were $100.1 million for the six months ended September 28, 2019, a decrease of $73.0 million compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to stock compensation expense recognized in the prior year, as explained further below. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. U.S. Factory-built Housing: Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the U.S. Factory-built Housing segment increased $19.6 million, or 38.5%, during the six months ended September 28, 2019 as compared to the same period in the prior year. Selling, general, and administrative expenses, as a percent of segment net sales, was 11.0% for the six months ended September 28, 2019 compared to 8.9% during the comparable period in the prior year. The inclusion of six months of Skyline operations for the first half of fiscal 2020 versus four months for the same period of the prior year as well as intangible amortization related to the Exchange increased selling, general, and administrative expenses by $6.7 million. The Company recorded ramp up costs for capacity expansion of $2.1 million during the six months ended September 28, 2019. The remainder of the increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses was a combination of factors which include (i) higher sales commissions and incentive compensation, which is generally based on sales volume or a measure of profitability, and (ii) an increase in salaries and benefits to maintain competitive compensation packages to retain and recruit team members. Canadian Factory-built Housing: Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment decreased $0.2 million, or 5.0%, during the six months ended September 28, 2019 as compared to the same period of the prior year. The decrease is due to an effort to reduce fixed expenses during slower economic market cycles, partially offset by higher sales commissions and incentive compensation, which is generally based on sales volume or a measure of profitability. As a percent of segment net sales, selling, general, and administrative expenses for the Canadian segment was 7.5% for both the six months ended September 28, 2019 and the same period in the prior year. Corporate/Other: Selling, general, and administrative expenses for Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation operations, corporate costs incurred for all segments and intersegment eliminations. Selling, general, and administrative expenses for Corporate/Other decreased $92.5 million, or 78.3%, during the six months ended September 28, 2019 as compared to the same period of the prior year. The decrease is mainly related to stock compensation expense of $93.9 million recognized in the prior year triggered by the Exchange and secondary offerings, as well as a reduction in acquisition integration and restructuring costs of $3.0 million. This decrease was partially offset by a fair market value adjustment charge of $1.0 million related to property acquired in the Exchange and stock-based compensation expense for long term incentive plans of $2.1 million recorded during the six months ended September 28, 2019. 24 INTEREST EXPENSE , NET The following table summarizes the components of interest expense, net for the six months ended September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018: Six Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) September 28, 2019 September 29, 2018 Change % Change Interest expense $ 2,466 $ 2,699 $ (233 ) (8.6 %) Interest income (1,775 ) (800 ) (975 ) 121.9 % Interest expense, net $ 691 $ 1,899 $ (1,208 ) (63.6 %) Average outstanding floor plan payable $ 31,959 $ 29,407 Average outstanding long-term debt $ 50,759 $ 59,377 Interest expense, net was $0.7 million for the six months ended September 28, 2019, a decrease of $1.2 million compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease was primarily related to higher interest income recognized during the period as a result of higher average cash balances invested in short term facilities. In addition, the Company incurred reduced interest expense due to (i) a lower weighted average interest rate on its revolving credit facility of 3.9% as compared to 7.4% on the term loans under a previously outstanding credit agreement, and (ii) an average lower outstanding balance on its credit facility as compared to the same period in the prior year. OTHER EXPENSE The following table summarizes other expense for the six months ended September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018: Six Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) September 28, 2019 September 29, 2018 Change % Change Other expense $ — $ 7,720 $ (7,720 ) (100.0 %) Other expense for the six months ended September 29, 2018 primarily consists of $6.9 million of expenses related to legal, accounting, and advisory services associated with the Exchange. The Company also incurred $0.8 million of expenses for legal, accounting, and advisory services related to the secondary offerings. INCOME TAX EXPENSE The following table summarizes income tax expense for the six months ended September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018: Six Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) September 28, 2019 September 29, 2018 Change % Change Income tax expense $ 14,157 $ 9,262 $ 4,895 52.9 % Effective tax rate 28.7 % (13.5 %) Income tax expense for the six months ended September 28, 2019 was $14.2 million, representing an effective tax rate of 28.7%, compared to income tax expense of $9.3 million, representing an effective tax rate of (13.5%), for the six months ended September 29, 2018. The Company’s effective tax rate for the six months ended September 28, 2019 differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of 21.0%, due primarily to the effect of non-deductible expenses, state and local income taxes, and results in foreign jurisdictions. The Company’s effective tax rate for the six months ended September 29, 2018 differed from the federal statutory rate of 21.0% primarily due the effect of non-deductible expenses, state and local income taxes, one-time charges related to the Exchange and results of operations in foreign jurisdictions and non-taxable entities. The effective tax rate for the six months ended September 28, 2019 is more representative of the Company’s ongoing expected effective tax rate. ADJUSTED EBITDA The following table reconciles net income, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, to Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the six months ended September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018: 25 Six Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) September 28, 2019 September 29, 2018 Change % Change Net income (loss) $ 35,125 $ (77,878 ) $ 113,003 * Income tax expense 14,157 9,262 4,895 52.9 % Interest expense, net 691 1,899 (1,208 ) (63.6 %) Depreciation and amortization 9,379 6,958 2,421 34.8 % Equity-based compensation (for awards granted prior to December 31, 2018) 2,641 93,927 (91,286 ) (97.2 %) Foreign currency transaction (gain) loss (25 ) 33 (58 ) * Transaction costs — 6,905 (6,905 ) * Acquisition integration costs 1,378 3,502 (2,124 ) (60.7 %) Equity-offering costs — 816 (816 ) * Fair market value adjustment for asset classified as held for sale 986 — 986 * Restructuring costs and other 235 1,110 (875 ) (78.8 %) Adjusted EBITDA $ 64,567 $ 46,534 $ 18,033 38.8 % * indicates that the calculated percentage is not meaningful Adjusted EBITDA for the six months ended September 28, 2019 was $64.6 million, an increase of $18.0 million from the same period of the prior year. The increase is primarily a result of increased operating income after adjusting for the effect of increased depreciation and amortization, transaction-related expenses, integration costs, restructuring costs and non-cash equity-based compensation incurred in connection with the Exchange. The increase in operating income is primarily due to an increase in sales volume from the inclusion of the Skyline operations and an improvement in gross profit margins partially offset by higher selling , general, and administrative costs. See Adjusted EBITDA definition below for additional information regarding the definition and use of this metric in evaluating the Company’s results. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss plus (a) the provision for income taxes, (b) interest expense, net, (c) depreciation and amortization, (d) gain or loss from discontinued operations, (e) foreign currency gains and losses, (f) equity-based compensation awards granted prior to December 31, 2018, (g) restructuring charges, (h) impairment of assets, and (i) other non-operating costs including those for the acquisition and integration or disposition of businesses and idle facilities. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of earnings calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income or loss, net sales, operating income or earnings per share prepared on a U.S. GAAP basis. The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA is commonly used by investors to evaluate its performance and that of its competitors. However, the Company’s use of Adjusted EBITDA may vary from that of others in its industry. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, investors should be aware that in the future the Company may incur expenses similar to those adjusted for in this presentation. This presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that the Company’s future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items. Adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are: Adjusted EBITDA: • does not reflect the interest expense on our debt; • excludes impairments; and • does not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; • although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and • other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our U.S. GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures only on a supplemental basis. 26 BACKLOG Although orders from customers can be cancelled at any time without penalty, and unfilled orders are not necessarily an indication of future business, the Company’s unfilled U.S. and Canadian manufacturing orders for homes at September 28, 2019 totaled $172.0 million compared to $252.4 million at September 29, 2018. The reduction in backlog is driven by a decrease in order rates from retailers. The order rates are based on manufacturers’ backlogs and delivery times which are shorter, generally, than the same time last year. In addition, backlog for Canadian operations was lower in the current period due to continued softness in the western Canada housing markets. Liquidity and Capital Resources Sources and Uses of Cash The following table presents summary cash flow information for the three months ended September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018: Six Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) September 28, 2019 September 29, 2018 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 52,158 $ 29,018 Investing activities (9,392 ) 5,181 Financing activities (14,829 ) (67,904 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents 168 (38 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 28,105 (33,743 ) Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at beginning of period 126,634 136,616 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at end of period $ 154,739 $ 102,873 The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, existing cash balances and borrowings under available credit facilities. The Company has $39.4 million of unused borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facility. Cash balances and cash flow from operations for the next year are expected to be adequate to fund capital expenditures. The level of cash availability is projected to be in excess of cash needed to operate the business for the next year. In the event operating cash flow is inadequate and one or more capital resources were to become unavailable, the Company would revise operating strategies accordingly. Cash provided by operating activities was $52.2 million during the six months ended September 28, 2019 compared to $29.0 million during the six months ended September 29, 2018. Cash was generated by operating income (before non-cash charges) from higher sales and operating margins compared to the prior year. Additionally, there were no transaction expenses incurred for the Skyline acquisition or equity offering costs in the first half of fiscal 2020 compared to $7.5 million in the same period of the prior year, which contributed to the positive increase in cash provided by operating activities compared to the prior period. Cash used in investing activities was $9.4 million for the six months ended September 28, 2019 which was related to capital expenditures. The expenditures for capital items are part of the Company’s focus on efficiency and safety initiatives as well as the expansion of production capacity with the investment in the new Leesville, Louisiana manufacturing facility. Cash provided by investing activities was $5.2 million during the six months ended September 29, 2018 as a result of cash acquired in the Exchange of $9.7 million, offset by capital expenditures of $4.7 million. Cash used in financing activities was $14.8 million for the six months ended September 28, 2019, primarily related to the $10.0 million repayment on the revolving credit facility and $2.8 million, net repayment on the floor plan payable balance. Cash used in financing activities for the six months ended September 29, 2018 was $67.9 million, primarily as a result of distributions to Champion Holdings’ members of $65.3 million prior to completion of the Exchange and $2.0 million of additional payments made for deferred financing fees. The Company also borrowed $46.9 million under the revolving credit agreement during the six months ended September 29, 2018 and utilized the proceeds to repay term loans.

Basis of Presentation and Business On June 1, 2018, Skyline Champion Corporation (formerly known as Skyline Corporation), an Indiana corporation (the “Company”) and Champion Enterprises Holdings, LLC (“Champion Holdings”) completed the transactions contemplated by the Share Contribution & Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”), dated as of January 5, 2018, by and between the Company and Champion Holdings. Under the Exchange Agreement, (i) Champion Holdings contributed to the Company all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of each of Champion Holdings’ wholly-owned operating subsidiaries (the “Contributed Shares”), and (ii) in exchange for the Contributed Shares, the Company issued to the members of Champion Holdings, in the aggregate, 47,752,008 shares of the Company common stock (“Skyline Common Stock”) (such issuance, the “Shares Issuance”). Immediately following the Shares Issuance, the members of Champion Holdings collectively held 84.5 %, and the Company’s pre-closing shareholders collectively held 15.5 %, of the issued and outstanding Skyline Common Stock on a fully-diluted basis. The contribution of the Contributed Shares by Champion Holdings to Skyline, and the Shares Issuance by the Company to the members of Champion Holdings are collectively referred to herein as the “Exchange.” The Exchange was treated as a purchase of the Company by Champion Holdings for accounting and financial reporting purposes. As a result, the financial results for the three months ending June 30, 2018 are comprised of 1) the results of Champion Holdings for the period between April 1, 2018 and May 31, 2018 and 2) the Company, after giving effect to the Exchange, from June 1, 2018 through June 30, 2018. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company, have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) for Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Article 10 of SEC Regulation S-X. Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“U.S. GAAP”) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany balances and transactions. In the opinion of management, these statements include all normal recurring adjustments necessary to fairly state the Company’s consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial position. The Company has evaluated subsequent events after the balance sheet date through the date of the filing of this report with the SEC. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the SEC on May 23, 2019. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) and condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations or cash flows for the full year. The Company’s fiscal year is a 52- or 53-week period that ends on the Saturday nearest to March 31. The Company’s current fiscal year, “fiscal 2020”, will end on March 28, 2020. References to “fiscal 2019” refer to the Company’s fiscal year ended March 30, 2019. The three months ended June 29, 2019 and June 30, 2018 each included 13 weeks. The Company’s operations consist of manufacturing, retail and transportation activities. The Company operates 33 manufacturing facilities throughout the United States (“U.S.”) and five manufacturing facilities in western Canada that primarily construct factory-built, timber-framed manufactured and modular houses that are sold primarily to independent retailers and builders/developers. The Company’s retail operations consist of 21 sales centers that sell manufactured houses to consumers primarily in the Southern U.S. The Company’s transportation business engages independent owners/drivers to transport recreational vehicles throughout the U.S. and Canada and manufactured houses in certain regions of the U.S. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements: In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (“ASC 842”), to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. A lessee should recognize in the consolidated balance sheet a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and an asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee have not significantly changed from previous requirements. This ASC 842 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2018 and modified retrospective application is permitted. The Company adopted ASC 842 as of March 31, 2019, the first day of fiscal 2020 using the modified retrospective approach and without restating comparative periods. The Company has elected to apply the transition package of three practical expedients which allow companies not to reassess whether agreements contain leases, the classification of leases, and the capitalization of initial direct costs. The Company did not elect the practical expedient which permits the use of hindsight when determining the lease term and assessing right-of-use assets for impairment. As permitted by the standard, the Company elected to: 1) recognize lease expense for leases with a term of 12 months or less on a straight-line basis over the lease term and will not recognize any right of use assets or lease liabilities for those leases, and 2) not separate lease and non-lease components. 6 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued The primary financial statement impact upon adoption was the recognition, on a discounted basis, of the Company's minimum commitments under non-cancelable operating leases as right of use assets and obligations on the consolidated balance sheets. The adoption of ASC 842 resulted in the recognition of lease-related assets and liabilities of $ 13.7 million. The standard did not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations or cash flows. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Pending Adoption: In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment . The standard simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairments and allows a goodwill impairment charge to be based on the amount of a reporting unit’s carrying value in excess of its fair value. This eliminates the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill or what is known as “Step 2” under the current guidance. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods of public entities beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. This guidance requires the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This guidance also requires enhanced disclosures regarding significant estimates and judgments used in estimating credit losses. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements. There were no other accounting standards recently issued that are expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations. 2. Business Combination The Exchange was completed on June 1, 2018 and was accounted for as a reverse acquisition under the acquisition method of accounting as provided by the FASB Accounting Standards Codification 805, Business Combinations. Champion Holdings was deemed to be the acquirer for accounting and financial reporting purposes. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed as a result of the Exchange were recorded at their respective fair values and added to the carrying value of Champion Holdings’ existing assets and liabilities. The Company incurred acquisition-related costs of approximately $ 6.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 which was classified as other expense in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. Additionally, the Company incurred approximately $ 6.0 million in stock compensation expense related to former Skyline employees during the three months ended June 30, 2018, which is recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. These types of costs were no t incurred in the three months ended June 29, 2019. The purchase price of the acquisition was determined with reference to the value of equity (common stock) of the Company based on the closing price on June 1, 2018 of $ 33.39 per share. The purchase price has been allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed using their estimated fair values at June 1, 2018, the closing of the Exchange. The purchase price and the allocation have been used to prepare the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. The purchase price was allocated as follows: (Dollars in thousands) Allocation at March 30, 2019 Changes to Allocation Final Allocation at June 29, 2019 Cash $ 9,722 $ — $ 9,722 Trade accounts receivable 13,876 — 13,876 Inventory 19,028 — 19,028 Assets held for sale 2,086 — 2,086 Property, plant and equipment 40,220 — 40,220 Deferred tax assets, net 6,996 38 7,034 Other assets 6,706 — 6,706 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities ( 36,027 ) — ( 36,027 ) Intangibles 52,218 ( 153 ) 52,065 Goodwill 170,227 115 170,342 Total purchase price allocation $ 285,052 $ — $ 285,052 Goodwill is primarily attributable to expected synergies from the combination of the companies, including, but not limited to, expected cost synergies through procurement activities and operational improvements through sharing of best practices. Goodwill, which is not deductible for income tax purposes, was allocated to the U.S. Factory-built Housing reporting unit. Cash, trade receivables, other assets, accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities were generally stated at historical carrying values given the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities. Intangible assets consist primarily of amounts recognized for the fair value of customer relationships and trade names and were based on an independent appraisal. Customer-based assets include the Company’s established relationships with its customers and the ability of those customers to generate future economic profits for the Company. The Company estimates that these intangible assets have a weighted average useful life of ten years . Fair value estimates of property, plant, and equipment were based on independent appraisals and broker opinions of value, giving consideration to the highest and best use of the assets. Key assumptions used in the 7 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued appraisals were based on a combination of market and cost approaches, as appropriate. Level 3 fair value estimates of $ 40.2 million related to property, plant and equipment and $ 52.1 million related to intangible assets were recorded in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of June 29, 2019. The Company determined $ 2.1 million of property acquired in the Exchange met the definition of held for sale at the acquisition date and was classified in other current assets . The fair value less cost to sell of this held for sale property is evaluated each reporting period to determine if it has changed. A loss of $ 1.0 million was recorded during the three months ended June 29, 2019 related to this held for sale property based on updated market information . Assets held for sale were $ 1.1 million and $ 2.1 million as of June 29, 2019 and March 30, 2019, respectively. For further information on acquired assets measured at fair value, see Note 5 , Goodwill and Intangible Assets . The Company allocated a portion of the purchase price to certain realizable deferred tax assets totaling $ 27.3 million. Deferred tax assets are primarily federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and credits offset by a valuation allowance for certain state net operating loss carryforwards that are not expected to be realized. The deferred tax assets are offset by deferred tax liabilities of $ 20.3 million resulting from the purchase price allocation step-up in fair value that exceed the historical tax basis. The statement of operations for the three months ended June 30, 2018 includes $ 22.1 million of net sales attributable to the acquired Skyline operations. A summary of the results of operations for the Company, on an as reported and on a pro forma basis, are as follows: Three Months Ended June 30, 2018 (Dollars in thousands) Reported Pro forma Net sales $ 322,261 $ 368,065 Net (loss) income ( 853 ) 14,256 The pro forma results are based on adding the historical results of operations of Champion Holdings and Skyline and adjusting those historical amounts for the amortization of intangibles created in the Exchange; the increase in depreciation as a result of the step-up in fair value of property, plant and equipment; removing transaction costs directly associated with the Exchange; removing equity-based compensation expense directly resulting from the Exchange; reflecting the financing arrangements entered into in connection with the Exchange, and adjusting those items for income taxes. The pro forma disclosures do not give effect to the potential impact of current financial conditions, any anticipated synergies, operating efficiencies or cost savings that may result from the Exchange or any integration costs. The pro forma data is intended for informational purposes and is not indicative of the future results of operations. The Exchange Agreement provided that Champion Holdings was permitted to pay a capital distribution prior to completion of the Exchange to the extent it had cash in excess of debt and other debt-like items and unpaid Exchange fees and expenses. Prior to the completion of the Exchange, Champion Holdings made a capital distribution to its members equal to an aggregate of $ 65.3 million (of which $ 22.5 million was reflected as a reduction to retained earnings and $ 42.8 million was reflected as a reduction to members’ contributed capital). 3 . Inventories The components of net inventory, including inventory for the Company’s manufacturing and retail operations, were as follows: (Dollars in thousands) June 29, 2019 March 30, 2019 Raw materials $ 46,660 $ 48,531 Work in process 13,549 13,973 Finished goods and other 52,981 60,134 Total inventories $ 113,190 $ 122,638 At both June 29, 2019 and March 30, 2019, reserves for obsolete inventory were $ 4.1 million. 4 . Property, Plant, and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated primarily on the straight-line method, generally over the following estimated useful lives: land improvements – 3 to 10 years ; buildings and improvements – 8 to 25 years ; and vehicles and machinery and equipment – 3 to 8 years . Depreciation expense for the three months ended June 29, 2019 and June 30, 2018 was $ 3.1 million and $ 2.4 million, respectively. 8 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued The components of property, plant, and equipment were as follows: (Dollars in thousands) June 29, 2019 March 30, 2019 Land and improvements $ 34,412 $ 34,264 Buildings and improvements 84,958 83,973 Machinery and equipment 43,195 42,476 Construction in progress 6,668 3,619 Property, plant and equipment, at cost 169,233 164,332 Less: accumulated depreciation ( 58,997 ) ( 55,745 ) Property, plant, and equipment, net $ 110,236 $ 108,587 5 . Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. At June 29, 2019 and March 30, 2019, the Company had goodwill of $ 173.5 million and $ 173.4 million, respectively. The change during the three months ended June 29, 2019 was a result of the finalization of the allocation of net assets recognized in connection with the Exchange. Intangible Assets The components of amortizable intangible assets were as follows: (Dollars in thousands) June 29, 2019 March 30, 2019 Customer Relationships Trade Names Total Customer Relationships Trade Names Total Gross carrying amount $ 48,740 $ 13,218 $ 61,958 $ 48,782 $ 13,173 $ 61,955 Accumulated amortization ( 10,251 ) ( 4,286 ) ( 14,537 ) ( 9,052 ) ( 3,967 ) ( 13,019 ) Amortizable intangibles, net $ 38,489 $ 8,932 $ 47,421 $ 39,730 $ 9,206 $ 48,936 The Company recognized finite-lived intangibles for customer relationships of $ 43.1 million and trade names of $ 9.0 million as a result of the allocation of the purchase price from the Exchange. The fair value of the customer relationship intangible asset was estimated using the multi-period excess earnings method of the income approach. The fair value of the customer relationship intangible asset was determined based on estimates and assumptions of projected cash flows attributable to the acquired customer relationships, the annual attrition rate of existing customer relationships, the contributory asset charges attributable to the assets that support the customer relationships, such as net working capital, property, plant and equipment, trade name, and workforce, the economic life and the discount rate as determined at the time of the final valuation. The fair value of the trade name intangible asset was estimated using the relief-from-royalty method of the income approach. The fair value of the trade names intangible asset was determined based on estimates and assumptions used for the expected life of the intangible asset, the royalty rate and the discount rate that reflects the level of risk associated with the future cash flows as determined at the time of the final valuation. During the three months ended June 29, 2019 and June 30, 2018, amortization of intangible assets was $ 1.4 million and $ 0.5 million, respectively. 6 . Other Current Liabilities The components of other current liabilities were as follows: (Dollars in thousands) June 29, 2019 March 30, 2019 Customer deposits and receipts in excess of revenues $ 24,780 $ 28,392 Accrued volume rebates 17,561 21,020 Accrued warranty obligations 19,030 17,886 Accrued compensation and payroll taxes 25,142 32,075 Accrued insurance 18,192 16,245 Other 22,066 13,943 Total other current liabilities $ 126,771 $ 129,561 9 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued 7 .

Debt and Floor Plan Payable Long-term debt consisted of the following: (Dollars in thousands) June 29, 2019 March 30, 2019 Revolving credit facility maturing in 2023 $ 36,900 $ 41,900 Obligations under industrial revenue bonds due 2029 12,430 12,430 Total debt 49,330 54,330 Less current portion — — Total long-term debt $ 49,330 $ 54,330 On June 5, 2018, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of banks. The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility of up to $ 100.0 million, including a letter of credit sub-facility of not less than $ 45.0 million. Initial borrowings under the Credit Agreement were used to repay the Company’s existing $ 46.9 million term loans (“Term Loans”) and replace the Company’s existing cash collateralized stand-alone letter of credit facility. The revolving credit facility allows the Company to draw down, repay and re-draw loans on the available funds during the term of the Credit Agreement. During the three months ended June 29, 2019, the Company repaid $ 5.0 million of amounts previously drawn on the revolving credit facility. The Credit Agreement matures on June 5, 2023 and has no scheduled amortization. The interest rate under the Credit Agreement adjusts based on the first lien net leverage of the Company from a high of LIBOR plus 2.25 % and ABR plus 1.25 % when the first lien net leverage is equal to or greater than 2 .00:1.00, to a low of LIBOR plus 1.50 % and ABR plus 0.50 % when the first lien net leverage is below 0.50:1.00. In addition, the Company is obligated to pay an unused line fee ranging between 0.40 % and 0.25 % (depending on the first lien net leverage) in respect of unused commitments under the Credit Agreement. At June 29, 2019 the interest rate on borrowings under the Credit Agreement was 3.92 %. At June 29, 2019, letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement totaled $ 28.8 million. Total available borrowings under the Credit Agreement as of June 29, 2019 were $ 34.3 million. Obligations under industrial revenue bonds are supported by letters of credit and bear interest based on a municipal bond index rate. The weighted-average interest rate at June 29, 2019, including related costs and fees, was 3.83 %. At March 30, 2019, the weighted average interest rate was 3.62 %. The industrial revenue bonds require lump-sum payments of principal upon maturity in 2029 . The Credit Agreement contains covenants that restrict the amount of additional debt, liens and certain payments, including equity buybacks, investments, dispositions, mergers and consolidations, among other restrictions as defined. The Company was in compliance with all covenants of the Credit Agreement as of June 29, 2019. Floor Plan Payable The Company’s retail operations utilize floor plan financing to fund the acquisition of manufactured homes for display or resale. At June 29, 2019 and March 30, 2019, the Company had outstanding borrowings on floor plan financing agreements of $ 32.7 million and $ 33.3 million, respectively. Total credit line capacity provided under the agreements was $ 47.0 million as of June 29, 2019. Borrowings are secured by the homes and are required to be repaid when the Company sells the home to a customer. 10 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued 9 .

Leases The Company has operating leases for land, manufacturing and office facilities, and equipment. The Company's lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such option. The Company's leases do not contain material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease terms. Lease expense included in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of operations is shown below: (Dollars in thousands) Three Months Ended June 29, 2019 Operating lease expense $ 1,405 Short-term lease expense 373 Total lease expense $ 1,778 Operating lease assets and obligations included in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet are shown below: (Dollars in thousands) June 29, 2019 Right-of-use assets under operating leases: Other long-term assets $ 13,185 Lease obligations under operating leases: Other current liabilities 4,208 Other long-term liabilities 8,977 Total lease obligation $ 13,185 Maturities of lease obligations as of June 29, 2019, are shown below: (Dollars in thousands) June 29, 2019 Fiscal 2020 (1) $ 3,744 Fiscal 2021 3,891 Fiscal 2022 2,822 Fiscal 2023 2,035 Fiscal 2024 854 Thereafter 2,214 Total undiscounted cash flows 15,560 Less: imputed interest ( 2,375 ) Lease obligations under operating leases $ 13,185 (1) For remaining period in fiscal year. 11 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued The weighted average lease term and discount rate for operating leases are shown below: June 29, 2019 Weighted average remaining lease term (in years) 5.1 Weighted average discount rate 5.6 The discount rate used to measure a lease obligation should be the rate implicit in the lease; however, the Company’s operating leases generally do not provide an implicit rate. Accordingly, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate at lease commencement to determine the present value of lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is an entity-specific rate which represents the rate of interest a lessee would pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term with similar payments. Cash flow information related to operating leases is shown below: (Dollars in thousands) Three Months Ended June 29, 2019 Non-cash activity: Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for operating lease obligations $ 854 Operating cash flows: Cash paid related to operating lease obligations $ 1,534 1 1 . Income Taxes For the three months ended June 29, 2019 and June 30, 2018, the Company recorded $ 6.6 million and $ 3.4 million of income tax expense and had an effective tax rate of 27.6 % and 133.0 %, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the three months ended June 29, 2019, compared with the same period of 2018, was primarily due to costs related to the Exchange for which no tax benefit could be recognized. The Company’s effective tax rate for the three months ended June 29, 2019 differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of 21.0 % due primarily to the effect of non-deductible expenses, state and local income taxes and results in foreign jurisdictions. The Company’s effective tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2018 differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of non-deductible expenses, state and local income taxes, one-time charges related to the Exchange and results in foreign jurisdictions and non-taxable entities. During the three months ended June 29, 2019 the Company’s uncertain tax position did not change. During the three months ended June 30, 2018, the Company’s uncertain tax position decreased by $ 0.4 million due to expiration of certain statutes of limitations. The Company estimates no material changes to uncertain tax benefits in the next twelve months. The Company records interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense. Net interest and penalties for the periods presented herein were not significant. 1 2 . Earnings Per Share Basic net income (loss) per share (“EPS”) attributable to the Company was computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to the Company by the average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Certain of the Company’s time-vesting restricted share awards are considered participating securities. Diluted earnings per common share is computed based on the more dilutive of (i) the two-class method, assuming the participating securities are not exercised or converted; or (ii) the summation of average common shares outstanding and additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential common shares had been issued. During the three months ended June 29, 2019, the two-class method was more dilutive and was not applicable to the June 30, 2018 computation given the net loss recorded for the three months ended June 30, 2018. The number of shares used to calculate earnings per share prior to the Exchange was determined based on the exchange ratio, as defined in the Exchange Agreement. 12 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share: Three Months Ended (Dollars and shares in thousands, except per share data) June 29, 2019 June 30, 2018 Numerator: Net income (loss) $ 17,380 $ ( 853 ) Undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities ( 89 ) — Net income (loss) attributable to the Company's common shareholders $ 17,291 $ ( 853 ) Denominator: Basic weighted average shares outstanding 56,368 47,462 Dilutive securities 267 — Diluted weighted average shares outstanding 56,635 47,462 Basic net income (loss) per share $ 0.31 $ ( 0.02 ) Diluted net income (loss) per share $ 0.31 $ ( 0.02 ) 1 3 . Transactions with Related Parties Prior to the Exchange, the Company was party to a Management Advisory Services Agreement (“Services Agreement”) with Centerbridge Advisors, LLC; MAK Management L.P.; and Sankaty Advisors, LLC (collectively, the “Managers”), affiliates of which collectively owned a majority of the units of Champion Holdings and the Company’s common stock (the “Principal Shareholders”), whereby the Principal Shareholders provided management, consulting, financial and other advisory services to Champion Holdings. Management fee expense during the three months ended June 30, 2018, recognized prior to the Exchange, was $ 0.3 million. The Services Agreement was terminated in connection with the Exchange. The Management fee expense is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operation. 1 4 . Segment Information Financial results for the Company's reportable segments have been prepared using a management approach, which is consistent with the basis and manner in which financial information is evaluated by the Company's chief operating decision maker in allocating resources and in assessing performance. The Company’s chief operating decision maker, the Chief Executive Officer, evaluates the performance of the Company’s segment primarily based on net sales, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) and operating assets. The Company operates in two reportable segments: (i) U.S. Factory-built Housing, which includes manufacturing and retail housing operations and (ii) Canadian Factory-built Housing. Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation operations, corporate costs directly incurred for all segments and intersegment eliminations. Segments are generally determined by geography. Segment data includes intersegment revenues and corporate office costs that are directly and exclusively incurred for each segment. Total assets for Corporate/Other primarily include cash and certain deferred tax items not specifically allocated to another segment. 13 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued Selected financial information by reportable segment was as follows: Three Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) June 29, 2019 June 30, 2018 Net sales: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 331,605 $ 266,124 Canadian Factory-built Housing 23,700 27,354 Corporate/Other 16,583 28,783 Consolidated net sales $ 371,888 $ 322,261 Operating income: U.S. Factory-built Housing EBITDA $ 36,145 $ 22,916 Canadian Factory-built Housing EBITDA 3,055 3,521 Corporate/Other EBITDA ( 10,408 ) ( 13,454 ) Depreciation ( 3,110 ) ( 2,430 ) Amortization ( 1,362 ) ( 481 ) Consolidated operating income $ 24,320 $ 10,072 Depreciation: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 2,638 $ 2,045 Canadian Factory-built Housing 242 231 Corporate/Other 230 154 Consolidated depreciation $ 3,110 $ 2,430 Amortization of intangible assets: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 1,362 $ 420 Canadian Factory-built Housing — 61 Corporate/Other — — Consolidated amortization of intangible assets $ 1,362 $ 481 Capital expenditures: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 3,358 $ 1,281 Canadian Factory-built Housing 111 210 Corporate/Other 1,057 529 Consolidated capital expenditures $ 4,526 $ 2,020 (Dollars in thousands) June 29, 2019 March 30, 2019 Total Assets: U.S. Factory-built Housing (1) $ 491,518 $ 488,878 Canadian Factory-built Housing (1) 60,350 59,260 Corporate/Other (1) 170,623 151,816 Consolidated total assets $ 722,491 $ 699,954 (1) Deferred tax assets for the Canadian operations are reflected in the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment. U.S. deferred tax assets are presented in Corporate/Other because an allocation between segments is not practicable. 1 5 . Commitments, Contingencies and Legal Proceedings Repurchase Contingencies and Guarantees The Company is contingently liable under terms of repurchase agreements with lending institutions that provide wholesale floor plan financing to retailers. These arrangements, which are customary in the manufactured housing industry, provide for the repurchase of products sold to retailers in the event of default by the retailer on their agreement to pay the financial institution. The risk of loss from these agreements is spread over numerous retailers. The repurchase price is generally determined by the original sales price of the product and pre-defined curtailment arrangements. The Company accounts for the guarantees under its repurchase agreements with the retailers’ financing institutions by estimating and deferring a portion of the related product sale that represents the estimated fair value of the repurchase obligation. The estimated fair value takes into account the estimate of the loss the Company will incur upon resale of any repurchases. This estimate is based on recent historical experience supplemented by management’s assessment of current economic and other conditions affecting the Company’s retailers. The reserve for estimated losses under repurchase agreements was $ 0.9 million at June 29, 2019 and $ 1.0 million at March 30, 2019. Excluding the resale value of the homes, the contingent repurchase obligation as of June 29, 2019 was estimated to be approximately $ 166.9 million. Losses incurred on homes repurchased were immaterial during each of the three months ended June 29, 2019 and June 30, 2018. 14 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued In addition to the repurchase agreements, the Company has agreed to guarantee from 3 % to 50 % of certain retailers’ outstanding loans to a floor plan lender. At June 29, 2019, those guarantees totaled $ 0.6 million of which $ 0.5 million was outstanding. At June 29, 2019, the Company was contingently obligated for approximately $ 28.8 million under letters of credit, primarily consisting of $ 12.6 million to support long-term debt, $ 15.7 million to support the casualty insurance program, $ 0.2 million to support repurchase obligations, and $ 0.3 million to support bonding agreements. The letters of credit are backed by a sub-facility under the New Credit Agreement. The Company was also contingently obligated for $ 23.9 million under surety bonds, generally to support performance on long-term construction contracts and license and service bonding requirements. In the normal course of business, the Company’s former subsidiaries that operated in the United Kingdom historically provided certain guarantees to two customers. Those guarantees provide contractual liability for proven construction defects up to 12 years from the date of delivery of certain products. The guarantees remain a contingent liability of the Company which declines over time through October 2027. As of the date of this report, the Company expects few, if any, claims to be reported under the terms of the guarantees. Legal Proceedings The Company has agreed to indemnify counterparties in the ordinary course of its business in agreements to acquire and sell business assets and in financing arrangements. The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of its business. As of the date of this filing, the Company believes the ultimate liability with respect to these contingent obligations will not have, either individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 15 Item 2. MANAGEMENT’ S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following should be read in conjunction with Skyline Champion Corporation’s condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear in Item I of this Report. Overview On June 1, 2018, Skyline Champion Corporation (the “Company”) was formed by Skyline Corporation (“Skyline”) and Champion Enterprises Holdings, LLC (“Champion”) combining their operations pursuant to the Share Contribution & Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”), dated as of January 5, 2018, by and between Skyline and Champion Holdings, as described in further detail below. Champion Holdings was formed as a Delaware limited liability company in 2010. Skyline was originally incorporated in Indiana in 1959. The Company is a leading producer of factory-built housing in the U.S. and Canada. The Company serves as a complete solutions provider across complementary and vertically integrated businesses including manufactured construction, company-owned retail locations, and transportation logistics services. The Company is the largest independent publicly traded factory-built solutions provider in North America based on revenue and markets its homes under several nationally recognized brand names including Skyline Homes, Champion Home Builders, Athens Park Models, Dutch Housing, Excel Homes, Homes of Merit, New Era, Redman Homes, Shore Park, Silvercrest, Titan Homes in the U.S. and Moduline and SRI Homes in western Canada. The Company operates 33 manufacturing facilities throughout the U.S. and five manufacturing facilities in western Canada that primarily construct factory-built, timber-framed manufactured and modular houses that are sold primarily to independent retailers and builders/developers, including manufactured home community operators. The Company’s retail operations consist of 21 sales centers that sell manufactured homes to consumers primarily in the southern U.S. The Company’s transportation business engages independent owners/drivers to transport manufactured homes and recreational vehicles throughout the U.S. and Canada. Acquisitions and Expansions Over the last several years, market demand for the Company’s products, primarily affordable housing in the U.S., has continued to improve. As a result, the Company has focused on operational improvements to make existing manufacturing facilities more profitable as well as executing measured expansion of its manufacturing and retail footprint. In response to the increasing demand for factory-built housing in the U.S., the Company has increased capacity through strategic acquisitions and expansions of its manufacturing footprint. The Company is focused on growing in strong HUD-markets across the U.S. as well as further expanding into the Northeast and Midwest U.S. modular housing markets. During June 2019, the Company began production at its newest manufactured housing facility in Leesville, Louisiana. During fiscal 2019, the Company completed its expansion of its Corona, California facility by adding a second production line and expanded its Leola, Pennsylvania campus by adding an additional plant. Production at the Leola facility began in April 2019. The Exchange added eight plants to the Company’s manufacturing footprint in fiscal 2019 (described in more detail below). In April 2017, the Company completed the purchase of a factory-built housing plant in Mansfield, Texas. In January 2017, the Company restarted operations at the Liverpool, Pennsylvania location, which was one of five modular manufacturing facilities acquired through a series of transactions with Innovative Building Systems, LLC and its subsidiaries. (“IBS” or the “IBS Acquisition”). The other facilities acquired from IBS are idle and provide the Company with opportunity to add capacity. The Company has also focused on expansion of its company-owned retail operations, opening three additional retail sales centers during fiscal 2018 and five during fiscal 2017. Management believes retail expansion provides an opportunity to increase the Company’s presence in market segments that are not currently served through its independent retail network, while also providing for expansion and increased utilization of existing manufacturing operations. These acquisitions and investments are part of a strategy to grow and diversify revenue with a focus on increasing the Company’s HUD and modular homebuilding presence in the U.S. as well as improving the results of operations. These acquisitions and investments are included in the consolidated results for periods subsequent to their respective acquisition dates. Combination with Skyline On January 5, 2018, Champion Holdings and Skyline entered into an Exchange Agreement pursuant to which the two companies agreed to combine their operations. The Exchange was completed on June 1, 2018 and was accounted for as a reverse acquisition under the acquisition method of accounting as provided by FASB Accounting Standards Codification 805, Business Combinations (“ASC 805”). Champion Holdings was determined to be the acquirer for accounting and financial reporting purposes. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed by Champion Holdings as a result of the Exchange were recorded at their respective fair values and added to the carrying value of Champion Holdings existing assets and liabilities. As Champion Holdings is the accounting acquirer, the Company’s financial results for the three months ending June 30, 2018 are comprised of 1) the results of Champion Holdings for the period between April 1, 2018 and May 31, 2018 and 2) the Company, after giving effect to the Exchange, from June 1, 2018 through June 30, 2018. 16 Industry and Company Outlook For the three months ended June 29, 2019, approximately 77% of the Company’s U.S. manufacturing sales were generated from the manufacture of homes that comply with the Federal HUD-code construction standard in the U.S. The industry reports U.S. HUD-code shipments on a one month lag. Industry shipments of HUD-code homes were 24,210 during the three months ended May 31, 2019 compared to 25,861 units shipped in same period of the prior year. The Company’s HUD market share during those periods was 17.0% versus 13.0% in the comparable period of the prior year. Industry sales of HUD-code homes have increased since 2009, when 50,000 HUD-code homes were sold. Fewer factory-built homes were sold in 2009 than in any year since 1959. While HUD-code factory-built home shipments have improved modestly over the past few years, the industry continues to operate at relatively low levels compared to historical shipment statistics. For instance, the long-term average for manufactured home shipments since 1960 is approximately 222,000 units per year. The industry reports U.S. modular market shipments quarterly and three months in arrears. Industry shipments of modular homes in the U.S. of 3,080 during the first quarter of calendar year 2019 was 12.4% lower than the 3,514 units shipped in the comparable period of the prior year. The Company’s modular market share during these periods was 14.6% and 11.8%, respectively. Modular home sales across the industry have generally been stable since 2009. For the three months ended June 29, 2019, approximately 16% of the Company’s U.S. manufacturing sales were modular. UNAUDITED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR Q1 FISCAL YEAR 2020 VS. 2019 Three Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) June 29, 2019 June 30, 2018 Results of Operations Data: Net sales $ 371,888 $ 322,261 Cost of sales 295,853 267,101 Gross profit 76,035 55,160 Selling, general and administrative expenses 51,715 45,088 Operating income 24,320 10,072 Interest expense, net 309 1,072 Other expense — 6,413 Income before income taxes 24,011 2,587 Income tax expense 6,631 3,440 Net income (loss) $ 17,380 $ (853 ) Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA: Net income (loss) $ 17,380 $ (853 ) Income tax expense 6,631 3,440 Interest expense, net 309 1,072 Depreciation and amortization 4,472 2,911 Equity-based compensation (for awards granted prior to December 31, 2018) 1,107 8,088 Foreign currency transaction (gain) loss (72 ) 67 Transaction costs — 6,413 Acquisition integration costs 1,038 1,189 Fair market value adjustment for asset classified as held for sale 986 — Restructuring costs 234 408 Adjusted EBITDA $ 32,085 $ 22,735 As a percent of net sales: Gross profit 20.4 % 17.1 % Selling, general and administrative expenses 13.9 % 14.0 % Operating income 6.5 % 3.1 % Net income (loss) 4.7 % (0.3 %) Adjusted EBITDA 8.6 % 7.1 % 17 NET SALES The following table summarizes net sales for the three months ended June 29, 2019 and June 30, 2018: Three Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) June 29, 2019 June 30, 2018 Change % Change Net sales $ 371,888 $ 322,261 $ 49,627 15.4 % U.S. manufacturing and retail net sales $ 331,605 $ 266,124 $ 65,481 24.6 % U.S. homes sold 5,448 4,536 912 20.1 % U.S. manufacturing and retail average home selling price $ 60.9 $ 58.6 $ 2.3 3.9 % Canadian manufacturing net sales $ 23,700 $ 27,354 $ (3,654 ) (13.4 %) Canadian homes sold 285 362 (77 ) (21.3 %) Canadian manufacturing average home selling price $ 83.2 $ 75.6 $ 8 10.1 % Corporate/Other net sales $ 16,583 $ 28,783 $ (12,200 ) (42.4 %) U.S. manufacturing facilities in operation at end of period 33 31 2 6.5 % U.S. retail sales centers in operation at end of period 21 21 — — % Canadian manufacturing facilities in operation at end of period 5 5 — — % Net sales for the three months ended June 29, 2019 were $371.9 million, an increase of $49.6 million, or 15.4% over the three months ended June 30, 2018. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. U.S. Factory-built Housing: The U.S. Factory-built Housing segment accounted for the Company’s net sales growth for the three months ended June 29, 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year. Sales of homes for the Company’s U.S. manufacturing and retail operations increased by $65.5 million, or 24.6%. The number of homes sold during the three months ended June 29, 2019 increased by 912 units, or 20.1%. Net sales increased by $50.6 million due to the inclusion of the Skyline operations for all three months in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to the same period of the prior year which only included one month of Skyline operations. The remainder of the increase was due to a combination of factors which included additional manufacturing capacity, plant operating improvements, and an increase in the average home selling price which was driven primarily by product mix. Product mix fluctuations result from consumer preferences regarding the types and styles of homes selected for purchase, as well as opting for home upgrade packages and regional housing dynamics. The Company’s U.S. HUD market share for the reporting period grew to 17.0% from 13.0% in the same period of the prior year, primarily due to the inclusion of the Skyline operations for the period subsequent to the Exchange. However, the U.S. HUD market softened during the reported period as shipments of factory-built HUD homes were 6.4% less than the same period of the prior year. Canadian Factory-built Housing: The Canadian Factory-built Housing segment net sales decreased by $3.7 million, or 13.4% for the three months ended June 29, 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a 21.3% decrease in number of homes sold, offset by a 10.1% increase in average home selling price which was a result of pricing actions taken by the Company and shifts in product mix. The number of homes sold decreased due to the decline in manufactured housing demand in the British Columbia and Alberta provinces versus the same period in the prior year. On a constant currency basis, net sales for the Canadian segment were unfavorably impacted by approximately $1.0 million as the Canadian dollar weakened compared to the U.S. dollar during the first quarter of fiscal 2020 as compared to the same period of the prior year. Corporate/Other: Net sales for Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation business and the elimination of intersegment sales. For the three months ended June 29, 2019, net sales decreased $12.2 million, or 42.4%. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower net sales in the Company’s transportation business primarily as a result of lower shipments associated with reduced RV demand in the U.S. 18 GROSS PROFIT The following table summarizes gross profit for the three months ended June 29, 2019 and June 30, 2018 : Three Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) June 29, 2019 June 30, 2018 Change % Change Gross profit: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 68,315 $ 45,322 $ 22,993 50.7 % Canadian Factory-built Housing 4,626 5,355 (729 ) (13.6 %) Corporate/Other 3,094 4,483 (1,389 ) (31.0 %) Total gross profit $ 76,035 $ 55,160 $ 20,875 37.8 % Gross profit as a percent of net sales 20.4 % 17.1 % Gross profit as a percent of sales during the three months ended June 29, 2019 was 20.4% compared to 17.1% during three months ended June 30, 2018. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. U.S. Factory-built Housing: Gross profit for the U.S. Factory-built Housing segment increased by $23.0 million, or 50.7%, during the three months ended June 29, 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in gross profit is due to the increase in sales volumes and improved margins. Gross profit was 20.6% as a percent of segment net sales for the three months ended June 29, 2019 compared to 17.0% in the same period of the prior year. Gross profit expansion was driven by an increase in the refinement of product offerings, favorable lumber and oriented strand board (“OSB”) pricing, plant operating improvements, in addition to procurement and operational synergies related to the Exchange, partially offset by labor inflation. Canadian Factory-built Housing: Gross profit for the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment decreased $0.7 million, or 13.6%, during the three months ended June 29, 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to lower sales volume. Gross profit as a percent of net sales was 19.5% for the three months ended June 29, 2019, compared to 19.6% in the same period of the prior year. Gross margin has remained stable despite the decline in net sales due to product mix, lower material commodity pricing, and efforts to reduce fixed expenses during slower economic market cycles. Corporate/Other: Gross profit for the Corporate/Other segment decreased $1.4 million, or 31.0%, during the three months ended June 29, 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year. However, Corporate/Other gross profit improved as a percent of segment net sales to 18.7% from 15.6%. Gross margins for the Company’s transportation business improved as a percent of sales due in part to less brokered business to other providers at lower margins in response to the decline in revenue caused by the drop in market demand for RVs. SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Selling, general and administrative expenses include foreign currency transaction gains and losses, equity compensation and intangible amortization expense. The following table summarizes selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended June 29, 2019 and June 30, 2018: Three Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) June 29, 2019 June 30, 2018 Change % Change Selling, general and administrative expenses: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 36,171 $ 24,511 $ 11,660 47.6 % Canadian Factory-built Housing 1,813 2,126 (313 ) (14.7 %) Corporate/Other 13,731 18,451 (4,720 ) (25.6 %) Total selling, general and administrative expenses $ 51,715 $ 45,088 $ 6,627 14.7 % Selling, general and administrative expense as a percent of net sales 13.9 % 14.0 % Selling, general and administrative expenses were $51.7 million for the three months ended June 29, 2019, an increase of $6.6 million compared to the same period in the prior year. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. 19 U.S. Factory-built Housing: Selling, general and administrative expenses for the U.S. Factory-built Housing segment increased $11.7 million, or 47.6%, during the three months ended June 29, 2019 as compared to the same period in the prior year. Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percent of segment net sales, was 10.9% for the three months ended June 29, 2019 compared to 9.2% during the comparable period in the prior year. The inclusion of three months of Skyline operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 versus one month for the same period of the prior year as well as intangible amortization related to the Exchange increased selling, general and administrative expenses by $5.7 million. The Company recorded ramp up costs for capacity expansion of $1.3 million during the three months ended June 29, 2019. The remainder of the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was a combination of factors which include (i) higher sales commissions and incentive compensation, which is generally based on sales volume or a measure of profitability and; (ii) an increase in salaries and benefits to maintain competitive compensation packages to retain and recruit team members. Canadian Factory-built Housing: Selling, general and administrative expenses for the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment decreased $0.3 million, or 14.7%, during the three months ended June 29, 2019 as compared to the same period of the prior year. The decrease is due to an effort to reduce fixed expenses during slower economic market cycles. As a percent of segment net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses for the Canadian segment was 7.6% for the three months ended June 29, 2019 compared to 7.8% for the same period in the prior year. Corporate/Other: Selling, general and administrative expenses for Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation operations, corporate costs incurred for all segments and intersegment eliminations. Selling, general and administrative expenses for Corporate/Other decreased $4.7 million during the three months ended June 29, 2019 as compared to the same period of the prior year. The decrease is mainly related to $6.0 million in stock compensation expense awarded to former Skyline employees during the period ended June 30, 2018. This decrease was partially offset by a fair market value adjustment charge of $1.0 million related to property acquired in the Exchange and recurring stock based compensation expense of $1.0 million recorded during the three months ended June 29, 2019. INTEREST EXPENSE, NET The following table summarizes the components of interest expense, net for the three months ended June 29, 2019 and June 30, 2018: Three Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) June 29, 2019 June 30, 2018 Change % Change Interest expense $ 1,271 $ 1,503 $ (232 ) (15.4 %) Interest income (962 ) (431 ) (531 ) 123.2 % Interest expense, net $ 309 $ 1,072 $ (763 ) (71.2 %) Average outstanding floor plan payable $ 32,811 $ 30,069 Average outstanding long-term debt $ 53,080 $ 59,331 Interest expense, net was $0.3 million for the three months ended June 29, 2019, a decrease of $0.8 million compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease was primarily related to higher interest income recognized during the period as a result of higher average cash balances invested in short term facilities. In addition, the Company incurred reduced interest expense due to: i) a lower weighted average interest rate on its revolving credit facility of 4.0% as compared to 7.4% on the term loans under a previously outstanding credit agreement and ii) an average lower outstanding balance on its credit facility as compared to the same period in the prior year. OTHER EXPENSE The following table summarizes other expense for the three months ended June 29, 2019 and June 30, 2018: Three Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) June 29, 2019 June 30, 2018 Change % Change Other expense $ — $ 6,413 $ (6,413 ) (100.0 %) Other expense for the three months ended June 30, 2018 related to legal, accounting, and advisory services associated with the Exchange. 20 INCOME TAX EXPENSE The following table summarizes income tax expense for the three months ended June 29, 2019 and June 30, 2018: Three Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) June 29, 2019 June 30, 2018 Change % Change Income tax expense $ 6,631 $ 3,440 $ 3,191 92.8 % Effective tax rate 27.6 % 133.0 % Income tax expense for the three months ended June 29, 2019 was $6.6 million, representing an effective tax rate of 27.6%, compared to income tax expense of $3.4 million, representing an effective tax rate of 133.0%, for the three months ended June 30, 2018. The Company’s effective tax rate for the three months ended June 29, 2019 differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of 21.0%, due primarily to the effect of non-deductible expenses, state and local income taxes, and results in foreign jurisdictions. The Company’s effective tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2018 differed from the federal statutory rate of 21.0% primarily due the effect of non-deductible expenses, state and local income taxes, one-time charges related to the Exchange and results of operations in foreign jurisdictions and non-taxable entities. The current quarter’s effective tax rate is more representative of the Company’s ongoing expected effective tax rate. ADJUSTED EBITDA The following table reconciles net income, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, to Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the three months ended June 29, 2019 and June 30, 2018: Three Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) June 29, 2019 June 30, 2018 Change % Change Net income (loss) $ 17,380 $ (853 ) $ 18,233 * Income tax expense 6,631 3,440 3,191 92.8 % Interest expense, net 309 1,072 (763 ) (71.2 %) Depreciation and amortization 4,472 2,911 1,561 53.6 % Equity-based compensation (for awards granted prior to December 31, 2018) 1,107 8,088 (6,981 ) (86.3 %) Foreign currency transaction (gain) loss (72 ) 67 (139 ) (207.5 %) Transaction costs — 6,413 (6,413 ) (100.0 %) Acquisition integration costs 1,038 1,189 (151 ) (12.7 %) Fair market value adjustment for asset classified as held for sale 986 — 986 * Restructuring costs 234 408 (174 ) (42.6 %) Adjusted EBITDA $ 32,085 $ 22,735 $ 9,350 41.1 % * indicates that the calculated percentage is not meaningful Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended June 29, 2019 was $32.1 million, an increase of $9.4 million from the same period of the prior year. The increase is primarily a result of increased operating income after adjusting for the effect of increased depreciation and amortization, transaction-related expenses, integration costs, restructuring costs and non-cash equity-based compensation incurred in connection with the Exchange. The increase in operating income is primarily due to an increase in sales volume and an improvement in gross profit margins partially offset by higher selling , general and administrative costs. See Adjusted EBITDA definition below for additional information regarding the definition and use of this metric in evaluating the Company’s results. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss plus (a) the provision for income taxes, (b) interest expense, net, (c) depreciation and amortization, (d) gain or loss from discontinued operations, (e) foreign currency gains and losses, (f) equity-based compensation awards granted prior to December 31, 2018, (g) restructuring charges, (h) impairment of assets, and (i) other non-operating costs including those for the acquisition and integration or disposition of businesses and idle facilities. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of earnings calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income or loss, net sales, operating income or earnings per share prepared on a U.S. GAAP basis. The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA is commonly used by investors to evaluate its performance and that of its competitors. However, the Company’s use of Adjusted EBITDA may vary from that of others in its industry. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, investors should be aware that in the future the Company may incur expenses similar to those adjusted for in this presentation. This presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that the Company’s future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items. 21 Adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are: Adjusted EBITDA: • does not reflect the interest expense on our debt; • excludes impairments; and • does not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; • although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and • other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our U.S. GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures only on a supplemental basis. BACKLOG Although orders from customers can be cancelled at any time without penalty, and unfilled orders are not necessarily an indication of future business, the Company’s unfilled U.S. and Canadian manufacturing orders for homes at June 29, 2019 totaled $153.0 million compared to $221.8 million at June 30, 2018. The current quarter’s U.S. backlog was impacted by demand softening due to retail inventory destocking in certain markets. Backlog at June 30, 2018 was higher than normal in part due to longer backlogs created by the Federal Emergency Management Agency orders produced through February 2018. In addition, backlog for the Canadian operations was lower in the current year first quarter due to continued softness in the western Canada housing markets. Liquidity and Capital Resources Sources and Uses of Cash The following table presents summary cash flow information for the three months ended June 29, 2019 and June 30, 2018: Three Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) June 29, 2019 June 30, 2018 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 26,780 $ 4,265 Investing activities (4,514 ) 7,738 Financing activities (5,653 ) (67,502 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents 400 (226 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 17,013 (55,725 ) Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at beginning of period 126,634 136,616 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at end of period $ 143,647 $ 80,891 The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, existing cash balances and borrowings under available credit facilities. The Company has $34.3 million of unused borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facility. Cash balances and cash flow from operations for the next year are expected to be adequate to fund capital expenditures. The level of cash availability is projected to be in excess of cash needed to operate the business for the next year. In the event operating cash flow is inadequate and one or more capital resources were to become unavailable, the Company would revise operating strategies accordingly. Cash provided by operating activities was $26.8 million during the three months ended June 29, 2019 compared to $4.3 million during the three months ended June 30, 2018. Cash was generated by operating income (before non-cash charges) from higher operating margins, lower finished goods inventory and improved working capital management compared to the prior year. Additionally, there were no transaction expenses incurred for the Skyline acquisition in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to of $6.4 million in the same period of the prior year, which contributed to the positive increase in cash provided by operating activities compared to the prior period. Cash used in investing activities was $4.5 million for the three months ended June 29, 2019 which was related to capital expenditures. The expenditures for capital items are part of the Company’s focus on efficiency initiatives as well as the expansion of production capacity with the investment in the new Leesville, Louisiana manufacturing facility. Cash provided by investing activities was $7.7 million during the three months ended June 30, 2018 as a result of cash acquired in the Exchange of $9.7 million, offset by capital expenditures of $2.0 million. 22 Cash used in financing activities was $ 5.7 million for the three months ended June 29, 2019, primarily related to the $5.0 million repayment on the revolving credit facility. Cash used in financing activities for the three months ended June 30, 2018 was $67.5 million , primarily as a result of distributions to Champion Holdings’ members of $65.3 million prior to completion of the Exchange an d $ 2.0 million of additional payments made for deferred financing fees. The Company also borrowed $46.9 million under the revolving c redit a greemen t during the three months ended June 30, 2018 and u tilized the proceeds to repay term loans.

Under the Exchange Agreement, (i) Champion Holdings contributed to the Company all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of each of Champion Holdings’ wholly-owned operating subsidiaries, Champion Home Builders, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“CHB”), and CHB International B.V., a Dutch private limited liability company (“CIBV”) (the shares of stock of CHB and CIBV contributed to the Company, the “Contributed Shares”), and (ii) in exchange for the Contributed Shares, the Company issued to the members of Champion Holdings, in the aggregate, 47,752,008 shares of the Company common stock, $0.0277 par value per share (“Skyline Common Stock”) (such issuance, the “Shares Issuance”). Immediately following the Shares Issuance, the members of Champion Holdings collectively held 84.5%, and the Company’s pre-closing shareholders collectively held 15.5%, of the issued and outstanding Skyline Common Stock on a fully-diluted basis. The contribution of the Contributed Shares by Champion Holdings to Skyline, and the Shares Issuance by the Company to the members of Champion Holdings are collectively referred to herein as the “Exchange.” The Exchange was treated as a purchase of the Company by Champion Holdings for accounting and financial reporting purposes. As a result, the financial results for the nine months ended December 29, 2018 comprise the results of only Champion Holdings through June 1, 2018 and the Company, after giving effect to the Exchange, from June 1, 2018 through December 29, 2018. All periods prior to June 1, 2018 are comprised solely of the results of Champion Holdings. All Company earnings per share and common share outstanding amounts in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have been calculated as if the Shares Issuance took place on April 2, 2017, at the exchange ratio, as defined in the Exchange Agreement. ii PART I - FINANCI AL INFORMATION Item 1.

See accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 4 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 1. Basis of Presentation and Business The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of Skyline Champion Corporation (the “Company”), have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Article 10 of SEC Regulation S-X. Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“U.S. GAAP”) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany balances and transactions. In the opinion of management, these statements include all normal recurring adjustments necessary to fairly state the Company’s consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial position. The Company has evaluated subsequent events after the balance sheet date through the date of the filing of this report with the SEC. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included as an exhibit to the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K/A, which was filed with the SEC on June 14, 2018. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) and condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations or cash flows for the full year. The Company’s fiscal year is a 52- or 53-week period that ends on the Saturday nearest to March 31. The Company’s current fiscal year, “fiscal 2019”, will end on March 30, 2019. References to “fiscal 2018” refer to the Company’s fiscal year ended March 31, 2018. The three and nine months ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 each included 13 and 39 weeks, respectively. The Company is a leading producer of factory-built housing in the United States (“U.S.”) and Canada and serves as a complete solutions provider across complementary and vertically integrated businesses including manufactured construction, company-owned retail locations, and transportation logistics services. The Company is the second largest factory-built solutions provider in North America based on revenue and markets its homes under several nationally recognized brand names including Skyline Homes, Champion Homes, Redman Homes, Dutch Housing, Excel Homes, Silvercrest, Titan Homes, Moduline, and SRI Homes. As of December 29, 2018, the Company operates 31 manufacturing facilities throughout the U.S. and five manufacturing facilities in western Canada that primarily construct factory-built, timber-framed manufactured and modular houses that are sold primarily to independent retailers and builders/developers, including manufactured home community operators. The Company’s retail operations consist of 21 sales centers that sell manufactured homes to consumers primarily in the southern U.S. The Company’s transportation business primarily engages independent owners/drivers to transport manufactured homes and recreational vehicles throughout the U.S. and Canada. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) , to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. A lessee should recognize in the consolidated balance sheet a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and an asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee have not significantly changed from previous requirements. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2018, or the Company’s fiscal year commencing March 31, 2019. Modified retrospective application and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this standard will have on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The Company expects the impact to the Company's consolidated balance sheet will be significant. The Company (i) has formed a cross-functional implementation team; (ii) is engaging a third party to assist with the implementation, and (iii) is implementing a software solution to manage and account for leases under the new standard. The Company plans to adopt the standard by applying the modified retrospective method on the March 31, 2019 adoption date as a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet, without restatement of comparative periods' financial information, based on transition guidance recently issued by the FASB. In addition, the Company expects to elect the package of practical expedients, exclusive of the lease term hindsight, as defined in the standard. 5 In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment . The standard simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairments and allows a goodwill impairment charge to be based on the amount of a reporting unit’s carrying value in excess of its fair value. This eliminates the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill or what is known as “Step 2” under the current guidance. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods of public entities beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements. There were no other accounting standards recently issued that are expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations. 6 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements – Continued 2. Business Combination On January 5, 2018, Champion Holdings and the Company entered into the Exchange Agreement pursuant to which the two companies agreed to combine their operations. The Exchange was completed on June 1, 2018 and was accounted for as a reverse acquisition under the acquisition method of accounting as provided by the FASB Accounting Standards Codification 805, Business Combinations (“ASC 805”). Champion Holdings was determined to be the acquirer for accounting and financial reporting purposes. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed by Champion Holdings as a result of the Exchange were recorded at their respective fair values and added to the carrying value of Champion Holdings’ existing assets and liabilities. As Champion Holdings is the accounting acquirer, reported financial results for Skyline Champion Corporation for the nine months ended December 29, 2018 comprise the results of only Champion Holdings through June 1, 2018 and the Company, after giving effect to the Exchange, from June 1, 2018 through December 29, 2018. All periods prior to June 1, 2018 are comprised solely of the results of Champion Holdings. The purchase price of the acquisition was determined with reference to the value of equity (common stock) of the Company based on the closing price on June 1, 2018 of $33.39 per share. The purchase price has been allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed using their estimated fair values at June 1, 2018, the closing of the Exchange. The purchase price and its allocation are preliminary and have been used to prepare the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. The final purchase price and its allocation will be determined when the Company has completed the necessary valuations and calculations. The final allocation could differ materially from the preliminary allocation used in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. The final allocation may include changes in allocations to intangible assets and other changes to the fair value assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The preliminary estimated purchase price was allocated as follows: (Dollars in thousands) Previously Reported Changes to Allocation Preliminary Allocation at December 29, 2018 Cash $ 9,722 $ — $ 9,722 Trade accounts receivable 13,876 — 13,876 Inventory 19,028 — 19,028 Property, plant and equipment 44,642 — 44,642 Deferred tax assets, net 9,733 (1,779 ) 7,954 Other assets 6,349 — 6,349 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities (35,763 ) (214 ) (35,977 ) Intangibles 43,300 7,393 50,693 Goodwill 174,278 (5,400 ) 168,878 Total preliminary estimated purchase price allocation $ 285,165 $ — $ 285,165 Preliminary estimated goodwill is primarily attributable to expected synergies from the combination of the companies, including, but not limited to, expected cost synergies through procurement activities and operational improvements through sharing of best practices. Goodwill, which is not deductible for income tax purposes, was allocated to the U.S. Factory-built Housing reporting unit. Cash, trade receivables, other assets, accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities were generally stated at historical carrying values given the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities. Intangible assets consist primarily of provisional amounts recognized for the fair value of customer relationships and trade names and were based on an independent appraisal. Customer-based assets include the Company’s established relationships with its customers and the ability of those customers to generate future economic profits for the Company. The Company estimates that these intangible assets have a weighted average useful life of ten years. Fair value estimates of property, plant and equipment were based on independent appraisals, giving consideration to the highest and best use of the assets. Key assumptions used in the appraisals were based on a combination of market and cost approaches, as appropriate. As a result of the June 2018 acquisition of Skyline Corporation, level 3 fair value estimates of $44.6 million related to property, plant and equipment and $50.7 million related to intangible assets were recorded in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets as of December 29, 2018. For further information on acquired assets measured at fair value, see Note 6, Goodwill and Intangible Assets. The Company allocated a portion of the preliminary estimated purchase price to certain realizable deferred tax assets totaling $28.4 million. Deferred tax assets are primarily federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and credits offset by a valuation allowance for certain state net operating loss carryforwards that are not expected to be realized. The deferred tax assets are offset by deferred tax liabilities of $20.4 million resulting from the purchase price allocation step-up in fair value that exceed the historical tax basis. 7 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements – Continued Included in the Company’s results of operations for the three and nine months ended December 29, 2018 , are results from the business acquired as follows: (Dollars in thousands) Three Months Ended December 29, 2018 Nine Months Ended December 29, 2018 Net sales $ 63,193 $ 153,337 A summary of the results of operations for the Company, on an as reported and on a pro forma basis, are as follows: Three Months Ended December 30, 2017 Nine Months Ended December 29, 2018 Nine Months Ended December 30, 2017 (Dollars in thousands) Reported Pro forma Reported Pro forma Reported Pro forma Net sales $ 294,378 $ 350,913 $ 1,032,368 $ 1,078,172 $ 798,443 $ 972,903 Net income (loss) 5,393 8,421 (67,365 ) (52,256 ) 18,064 22,281 The pro forma results are based on adding the historical results of operations of Champion Holdings and the Company and adjusting primarily for the amortization of intangibles created in the Exchange; the increase in depreciation as a result of the step-up in fair value of property, plant and equipment; removing transaction costs directly associated with the Exchange; removing equity-based compensation expense directly resulting from the Exchange; reflecting the financing arrangements entered into in connection with the Exchange, and adjusting those items for income taxes. The pro forma disclosures do not give effect to the potential impact of current financial conditions, any anticipated synergies, operating efficiencies or cost savings that may result from the Exchange or any integration costs. The pro forma data is intended for informational purposes and is not indicative of the future results of operations. The Exchange was completed during the first quarter of fiscal 2019, and therefore, there was no difference between the results of operations on an as reported and pro forma basis for the three months ended December 29, 2018. The Exchange Agreement provided that Champion Holdings was permitted to pay a capital distribution prior to completion of the Exchange to the extent it had cash in excess of debt and other debt-like items and unpaid Exchange fees and expenses. Prior to the completion of the Exchange, Champion Holdings made a capital distribution to its members equal to an aggregate of $65.3 million (of which $22.5 million was reflected as a reduction to retained earnings and $42.8 million was reflected as a reduction to members’ contributed capital). 3. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash On April 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2016-18, Restricted Cash . The standard requires that changes in restricted cash be reflected with changes in cash and cash equivalents on the statement of cash flows and that a reconciliation between cash and cash equivalents presented on the balance sheet and cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash presented on the statement of cash flows be provided. The provisions of the standard were applied retrospectively, and the effects of adoption were not significant. A reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash was as follows: (Dollars in thousands) December 29, 2018 March 31, 2018 (unaudited) Balance sheet - cash and cash equivalents $ 128,985 $ 113,731 Balance sheet - restricted cash — 22,885 Statement of cash flows - cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 128,985 $ 136,616 (Dollars in thousands) December 30, 2017 April 1, 2017 (unaudited) Balance sheet - cash and cash equivalents $ 78,906 $ 81,012 Balance sheet - restricted cash 22,842 21,680 Statement of cash flows - cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 101,748 $ 102,692 8 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements – Continued 4. Inventories The components of net inventory, including inventory for the Company’s manufacturing and retail operations, were as follows: (Dollars in thousands) December 29, 2018 March 31, 2018 (unaudited) Raw materials $ 45,133 $ 37,852 Work in process 13,299 10,004 Finished goods and other 52,919 50,166 Total inventories $ 111,351 $ 98,022 At both December 29, 2018 and March 31, 2018, reserves for obsolete inventory were $3.5 million. 5. Property, Plant, and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated primarily on the straight-line method, generally over the following estimated useful lives: land improvements – 3 to 10 years; buildings and improvements – 8 to 25 years; and vehicles and machinery and equipment – 3 to 8 years. Depreciation expense, including amortization of assets under capital lease, for the three and nine months ended December 29, 2018 was $2.9 million and $8.2 million, respectively, and for the three and nine months ended December 30, 2017 was $1.9 million and $5.8 million, respectively. The components of property, plant, and equipment were as follows: (Dollars in thousands) December 29, 2018 March 31, 2018 (unaudited) Land and improvements $ 34,797 $ 22,071 Buildings and improvements 85,863 58,179 Machinery and equipment 40,459 31,924 Construction in progress 3,122 919 Property, plant and equipment, at cost 164,241 113,093 Less accumulated depreciation 52,881 45,133 Property, plant, and equipment, net $ 111,360 $ 67,960 6. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. At December 29, 2018 and March 31, 2018, the Company had goodwill of $172.1 million and $3.2 million, respectively. The increase during the nine months ended December 29, 2018 was a result of goodwill recognized in the Exchange. Intangible Assets The components of amortizable intangible assets were as follows: (Dollars in thousands) December 29, 2018 March 31, 2018 Customer Relationships Trade Names Total Customer Relationships Trade Names Total (unaudited) Gross carrying amount $ 47,151 $ 13,131 $ 60,282 $ 5,739 $ 4,268 $ 10,007 Accumulated amortization (7,768 ) (3,600 ) (11,368 ) $ (5,610 ) $ (2,855 ) (8,465 ) Amortizable intangibles, net $ 39,383 $ 9,531 $ 48,914 $ 129 $ 1,413 $ 1,542 Weighted average amortization period, in years 9.4 8.9 9.3 4.3 5.5 5.4 9 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements – Continued During the nine months ended December 29, 2018, the Company recognized finite-lived intangibles for customer relationships of $41.7 million and trade names of $9.0 million as a result of the allocation of the preliminary estimated purchase price from the Exchange. The fair value of the customer relationship intangible asset was estimated using the multi-period excess earnings method of the income approach. The final determination of the customer relationship intangible asset will depend on changes to the assumptions used for projected cash flows attributable to the acquired customer relationships, the annual attrition rate of existing customer relationships, the contributory asset charges attributable to the assets that support the customer relationships, such as net working capital, property, plant and equipment, trade name, and workforce, the economic life and the discount rate as determined at the time of the final valuation. The fair value of the trade name intangible asset was estimated using the relief-from-royalty method of the income approach. The final determination of the trade names intangible asset will depend on changes to assumptions used for the expected life of the intangible asset, the royalty rate and the discount rate that reflects the level of risk associated with the future cash flows as determined at the time of the final valuation. Amortization of intangible assets for the three and nine months ended December 29, 2018 was $1.6 million and $3.3 million, respectively, and for the three and nine months ended December 30, 2017 was $0.2 million and $0.4 million, respectively. 7. Other Current Liabilities The components of other current liabilities were as follows: (Dollars in thousands) December 29, 2018 March 31, 2018 (unaudited) Customer deposits and receipts in excess of revenues $ 27,540 $ 24,557 Accrued volume rebates 22,259 17,037 Accrued warranty obligations 17,366 12,530 Accrued compensation and payroll taxes 25,051 24,100 Accrued insurance 16,934 11,112 Other 13,679 10,776 Total other current liabilities $ 122,829 $ 100,112 8.

The New Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility of up to $100.0 million, including a letter of credit sub-facility of not less than $45.0 million. Initial borrowings under the New Credit Agreement were used to repay the Company’s existing $46.9 million term loans (“Term Loans”) and replace the Company’s existing cash collateralized stand-alone letter of credit facility. The New Credit Agreement matures on June 5, 2023 and has no scheduled amortization. The interest rate under the New Credit Agreement adjusts based on the first lien net leverage of the Company. From June 5, 2018 through December 31, 2018, the annual interest rate is the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus 1.75% or an alternative base rate (“ABR”) described in the New Credit Agreement plus 0.75%, at the election of the Company. Thereafter, the interest rate adjusts based on the first lien net leverage from a high of LIBOR plus 2.25% and ABR plus 1.25% when the first lien net leverage is equal to or greater than 2.00:1.00, to a low of LIBOR plus 1.50% and ABR plus 0.50% when the first lien net leverage is below 0.50:1.00. In addition, the Company is obligated to pay an unused line fee ranging between 0.40% and 0.25% (depending on the first lien net leverage) in respect of unused commitments under the New Credit Agreement. At December 29, 2018 the interest rate on borrowings under the New Credit Agreement was 4.13%. Prior to entering into the New Credit Agreement, the Company had outstanding Term Loans of $46.9 million under a prior credit agreement with lenders that primarily included the Company’s equity holders and certain other affiliates. The interest rate on the Term Loans, priced using LIBOR plus an applicable margin, was 6.5% at March 31, 2018. Also, prior to entering into the New Credit Agreement, the Company provided letters of credit issued by a commercial bank under a separate stand-alone facility collateralized with restricted cash of 101% of the issued letters of credit. At December 29, 2018, letters of credit issued under the New Credit Agreement totaled $21.0 million. Subsequent to entering into the New Credit Agreement, the Company is no longer required to back letters of credit with restricted cash. Obligations under industrial revenue bonds are supported by letters of credit and bear interest based on a municipal bond index rate. The weighted-average interest rate at December 29, 2018, including related costs and fees, was 4.1%. At March 31, 2018, the weighted-average interest rate, including related costs and fees, was 3.2%. The industrial revenue bonds require lump-sum payments of principal upon maturity in 2029. The New Credit Agreement contains covenants that restrict the amount of additional debt, liens and certain payments, including equity buybacks, investments, dispositions, mergers and consolidations, among other restrictions as defined. The Company was in compliance with all covenants of the New Credit Agreement as of December 29, 2018. Floor Plan Payable The Company’s retail operations utilize floor plan financing to fund the acquisition of manufactured homes for display or resale. At December 29, 2018 and March 31, 2018, the Company had outstanding borrowings on floor plan financing agreements of $39.0 million and $29.8 million, respectively. Total available borrowings under the agreements as of December 29, 2018 and March 31, 2018 were $47.0 million and $43.0 million, respectively. Borrowings are secured by the homes and are required to be repaid when the Company sells the home to a customer. 10. Revenue Recognition In May 2014, the FASB issued an amendment on revenue recognition. The amendment created Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, (“ASC 606”) and supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition , including most industry-specific revenue recognition guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification. In addition, the amendment supersedes the cost guidance in Subtopic 605-35, Revenue Recognition - Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts , and created new Subtopic 340-40, Other Assets and Deferred Costs - Contracts with Customers . Under ASC 606 an entity recognizes revenue in a manner that reflects the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. On April 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASC 606 using the modified retrospective method as applied to customer contracts that were not completed as of March 31, 2018. As a result, financial information for reporting periods beginning after March 31, 2018, are presented in accordance with ASC 606 while prior reporting periods are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with the Company’s revenue recognition policies prior to the adoption of ASC 606. There was not a material impact to revenues as a result of applying ASC 606 for the three and nine months ended December 29, 2018 and the post-adoption effects to the Company’s business processes, systems or internal controls were not significant. The Company’s revenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of a contract are satisfied which generally occurs with the transfer of control of products. The Company enters into contracts with its customers to provide manufactured homes, modular homes, park models, commercial structures and transportation services. Generally, the Company’s contracts do not provide for a specified quantity of 11 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements – Continued products and may be terminated by the Co mpany’s customers at any time. Historically, terminations of these contracts have been minimal. The Company receives signed sales quotes from its customers, which provide the terms for a specific home, including price. The Company also has agreements with certain customers that provide for certain variable considerations such as volume discounts that are deducted from the contract price and accrued at the time of sale. In certain situations, the Company may receive payment in advance of completion of its co ntractual obligations. In these situations, the arising contract liability is classified within customer deposits and receipts in excess of revenues. Following the receipt of the customer deposit, the Company typically completes its performance obligation within a twelve-month period. For sales to independent retailers and builders/developers, revenue is recognized at the point in time when wholesale floor plan financing or retailer credit approval has been received, the home has shipped and title has been transferred, which occurs when the Company has satisfied its contractual obligations and the control of its products has been transferred. The Company does not have an enforceable right to payment prior to shipment. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration that the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those products. The Company’s customers pay for products received in accordance with payment terms that are customary within the industry. As is customary in the factory-built housing industry, a significant portion of the Company’s sales to independent retailers are financed under floor plan financing programs with certain third-party lenders. Floor plan financing arrangements are generally identified prior to shipment of products and payment for sales financed under floor plan programs is generally received 5 to 10 business days from the date of invoice. For retail sales to consumers from Company-owned retail sales centers, for which substantially all sales are of Company manufactured products, revenue is recognized when the home has been delivered, set up and accepted by the consumer, title has transferred and, depending on the nature of the transaction, either funds have been received from the finance company or directly from the home buyer. The Company recognizes commercial revenue and related cost of sales for long-term construction contracts (“Commercial”) over time as performance obligations are satisfied using the percentage-of-completion method (input method). Management estimates the stage of completion on each construction project based on progress and costs incurred. Unbilled revenue on long-term construction contracts are classified as a contract asset in accounts receivable. Receipts in excess of billings are classified as contract liabilities and included in other current liabilities. At December 29, 2018 and March 31, 2018, uncollected billings related to long-term construction contracts totaled $1.3 million and $5.0 million, respectively. At December 29, 2018, there was no unbilled revenue for long-term contracts. At March 31, 2018, unbilled revenue for long-term construction contracts was $0.3 million. Revenue for the Company’s transportation operations is recognized when a shipment has been delivered to its final destination. Amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling costs are included in net sales. Shipping and handling costs are accounted for as fulfillment costs and are included in cost of sales. Taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue producing transaction that are collected by the Company from a customer are excluded from net sales. The Company expenses sales commissions when incurred. Sales commissions are recorded in selling, general, and administrative expenses.

Other expense for the nine months ended December 29, 2018 was primarily related to legal, accounting and advisory services attributable to the Exchange of $6.9 million as well as $0.8 million for legal and advisory services related to three public offerings for the Company’s common stock. During the three and nine months ended December 30, 2017, the Company incurred expenses of $2.0 million and $2.8 million, respectively, related to legal, accounting and advisory services attributable to the Exchange. The Company also incurred $0.1 million of expenses related to a prior acquisition and the disposition of the Company’s former business unit in the United Kingdom during the nine months ended December 30, 2017. 12. Income Taxes For the three months ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017, the Company recorded $4.4 million and $15.1 million of income tax expense and had an effective tax rate of 29.7% and 73.6%, respectively. For the nine months ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 the Company recorded $13.7 million and $22.1 million of income tax expense and had an effective tax rate of (25.5%) and 55.0%, respectively. The change in the effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended December 29, 2018, compared with the same periods of 2017, was primarily due to costs related to the Exchange for which no tax benefit can be recognized including non-deductible equity-based compensation and the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new corporate income tax rate of 21%, from 35%, under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law on December 22, 2017 (the “Tax Act”). The Company’s effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended December 29, 2018 differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of 21%, due primarily to the effect of non-deductible expenses, state and local income taxes, one-time charges related to the Exchange and results of operations in foreign jurisdictions. The Company’s effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended December 30, 2017, was impacted by the IRS rules relating to transitional income tax rates for companies with a fiscal year end resulting in a blended federal statutory rate of 31.5% for fiscal 2018 as well as the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new corporate income tax rate of 21%, from 35% under the Tax Act. In addition, the Company’s effective tax rate was impacted by the effect of non-deductible expenses, state and local income taxes, results in foreign jurisdictions and non-taxable entities. The Company continued its analysis of the Tax Act during the third quarter of fiscal 2019 which resulted in no change to the provisional amounts recorded in fiscal 2018 related to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities. As of December 29, 2018, the Company completed its analysis of the impact of the Tax Act and the amounts are no longer considered provisional. During the three and nine months ended December 29, 2018, the Company’s uncertain tax positions decreased by $0.3 million and $0.7 million, respectively, due to the expiration of certain statutes of limitations. The Company estimates that the expected change to the total amount of uncertain tax benefits in the next twelve months will be an increase of $0.1 million due to additional accrual of interest and penalties. The Company records interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense. Net interest expense for the periods presented herein was not significant. 13. Equity-Based Compensation Champion Holdings granted awards to its officers, management employees and certain members of the Board of Managers under an equity-classified management incentive plan (the “MIP”). In accordance with the provisions of the MIP, as modified on June 1, 2018, unvested units of Champion Holdings granted under the MIP were exchanged for unregistered, time-vesting restricted shares and performance-vesting restricted shares of the Company subject to stock restriction agreements (the “SRAs”). The time-vesting restricted shares generally vest 20% per year over a five-year period, upon a change of control, or upon the occurrence of a follow-on public offering as defined in the SRAs. A portion of the performance-vesting restricted shares vested upon a follow-on public offering as defined in the SRAs. The remaining performance-vesting restricted shares vested based on meeting specified per share volume weighted average price targets subsequent to a follow-on public offering of the Company or upon a change of control as defined in the SRAs. During the three months ended September 29, 2018, a significant portion of the outstanding restricted shares vested in conjunction with certain follow-on public offerings. On September 26, 2018, the Company’s shareholders approved the Company’s 2018 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Equity Plan”) which provides for grants of options, stock appreciation rights, restricted and unrestricted stock and stock units, performance awards, and other awards convertible into or otherwise based on shares of the Company’s common stock. The full text of the Equity Plan was filed as an exhibit to the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on September 26, 2018. Prior to the approval of the Equity Plan, the Company maintained the Skyline Corporation 2015 Stock Incentive Plan, which allowed for the grant of stock options and other equity awards. Equity-based compensation expense of $3.7 million and $97.6 million was recognized during the three and nine months ended December 29, 2018, respectively. Equity-based compensation expense of $0.2 million and $0.5 million was recognized during the three and nine 13 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements – Continued months ended December 30, 2017 . Equity -based compensation expense was included in selling, general and administrati ve expenses in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). As of December 29, 2018 , the Company had 464,000 unvested time-vesting restricted shares issued to employees with a weighted average grant date fair value of $32.03 per share and an average remaining service period of nine months . No other unvested shares were outstanding. Compensation expense for unvested shares is recognized over the vesting period. 14. Earnings Per Share Basic net income (loss) per share (“EPS”) attributable to the Company was computed using the two-class method by dividing net income (loss) attributable to the Company, after deducting undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities, by the average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The Company’s time-vesting and performance-vesting restricted shares are considered participating securities. Diluted earnings per common share is computed based on the more dilutive of: (i) the two-class method, assuming the participating securities are not exercised or converted; or (ii) the summation of average common shares outstanding and additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential common shares had been issued. During the three and nine months ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017, diluted earnings per share was more dilutive under the two-class method. Securities that could potentially dilute basic EPS in the future that were antidilutive are described Note 13. The number of shares used to calculate earnings per share prior to the Exchange was determined based on the exchange ratio, as defined in the Exchange. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share: Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended (Dollars and shares in thousands, except per share data) December 29, 2018 December 30, 2017 December 29, 2018 December 30, 2017 (unaudited) (unaudited) Numerator: Net income (loss) $ 10,513 $ 5,393 $ (67,365 ) $ 18,064 Less: Undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities 86 337 — 1,142 Net income (loss) attributable to the Company's common shareholders $ 10,427 $ 5,056 $ (67,365 ) $ 16,922 Denominator: Average common shares outstanding 56,249 44,525 52,595 44,480 Basic net income (loss) per share $ 0.19 $ 0.11 $ (1.28 ) $ 0.38 Diluted net income (loss) per share $ 0.19 $ 0.11 $ (1.28 ) $ 0.38 15. Transactions with Related Parties Prior to the Exchange, the Company was party to a Management Advisory Services Agreement (“Services Agreement”) with Centerbridge Advisors, LLC; MAK Management L.P.; and Sankaty Advisors, LLC (collectively, the “Managers”), affiliates of which collectively owned a majority of the units of Champion Holdings and the Company’s common stock (the “Principal Shareholders”), whereby the Principal Shareholders provided management, consulting, financial and other advisory services to Champion Holdings in exchange for an annual management fee totaling $1.5 million plus reimbursable expenses. Management fee expense during fiscal 2019, recognized prior to the Exchange, was $0.3 million. The Service Agreement was terminated in connection with the Exchange. Management fee expense was $0.4 million and $1.1 million for the three and nine months ended December 30, 2017, respectively. Management fee expense is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). 16. Segment Information The Company operates in two reportable segments: (i) U.S. Factory-built Housing, which includes wholesale and retail housing operations and (ii) Canadian Factory-built Housing. Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation operations, corporate costs directly incurred for all segments and intersegment eliminations. Segments are generally determined by geography. Segment data includes intersegment revenues and corporate office costs that are directly and exclusively incurred for each segment. The Company evaluates the performance of its segments and allocates resources to them primarily based on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”). Total assets for Corporate/Other primarily include cash and certain deferred tax items not specifically allocated to another segment. 14 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements – Continued Selected financial information by reportable segme nt was as follows: Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) December 29, 2018 December 30, 2017 December 29, 2018 December 30, 2017 (unaudited) (unaudited) Net sales: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 309,518 $ 242,739 $ 882,257 $ 641,878 Canadian Factory-built Housing 27,130 24,950 79,885 74,006 Corporate/Other 18,023 26,689 70,226 82,559 Consolidated net sales $ 354,671 $ 294,378 $ 1,032,368 $ 798,443 Operating income: U.S. Factory-built Housing EBITDA $ 30,637 $ 27,184 $ 80,240 $ 52,988 Canadian Factory-built Housing EBITDA 2,568 1,836 9,123 8,475 Corporate/Other EBITDA (12,740 ) (3,609 ) (120,937 ) (9,157 ) Depreciation (2,944 ) (1,901 ) (8,219 ) (5,761 ) Amortization (1,633 ) (127 ) (3,316 ) (365 ) Consolidated operating income (loss) $ 15,888 $ 23,383 $ (43,109 ) $ 46,180 Depreciation: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 2,486 $ 1,553 $ 6,946 $ 4,706 Canadian Factory-built Housing 237 231 695 675 Corporate/Other 221 117 578 380 Consolidated depreciation $ 2,944 $ 1,901 $ 8,219 $ 5,761 Amortization of intangible assets: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 1,572 $ 65 $ 3,134 $ 182 Canadian Factory-built Housing 61 62 182 183 Corporate/Other — — — — Consolidated amortization of intangible assets $ 1,633 $ 127 $ 3,316 $ 365 Capital expenditures: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 1,463 $ 1,485 $ 4,919 $ 6,505 Canadian Factory-built Housing 158 354 572 754 Corporate/Other 1,322 175 2,136 608 Consolidated capital expenditures $ 2,943 $ 2,014 $ 7,627 $ 7,867 (Dollars in thousands) December 29, 2018 March 31, 2018 (unaudited) Total Assets: U.S Factory-built Housing (1) $ 465,095 $ 190,323 Canadian Factory-built Housing (1) 55,224 54,449 Corporate/Other (1) 157,945 150,626 Consolidated total assets $ 678,264 $ 395,398 (1) Deferred tax assets for the Canadian operations are reflected in the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment.

Commitments, Contingencies and Legal Proceedings Repurchase Contingencies and Guarantees As is customary in the manufactured housing industry, a significant portion of the Company’s sales to independent retailers are made pursuant to repurchase agreements with lending institutions that provide wholesale floor plan financing to retailers. The Company enters into two types of repurchase agreements, (i) those that allow repurchase up to 24 months after the sale of a home to the retailer, and (ii) those that allow for repurchase until the home is sold by the retailer. For those homes sold to retailers with an unlimited repurchase period, the Company’s risk of loss upon repurchase declines due to required monthly principal payments by the retailer. After 24 or 30 months from the date of the Company’s sale of the home, the risk of loss on these homes is low, and by the 46 th. month, most programs require that the home be paid in full, at which time the Company no longer has risk of loss. During the repurchase period, generally upon default by the retailer and repossession by the financial institution, the Company is obligated to repurchase the homes from the lender. Before including the reduction from the resale value of the homes, the contingent repurchase obligation as of December 29, 2018 was estimated to be approximately $190.4 million. Losses under repurchase obligations represent the difference between the repurchase price and net proceeds from the resale of the homes, less accrued rebates, which will not be paid. Losses incurred on homes repurchased were immaterial during each of the three and nine months ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017. The reserve for estimated losses under repurchase agreements was $0.8 million at December 29, 2018 and $0.7 million at March 31, 2018. The Company guarantees a portion of its customers’ floor plan obligations beyond the customary repurchase arrangements discussed above. The Company has agreed to guarantee from 3% to 50% of certain retailers’ outstanding loans to a floor plan lender. At December 29, 2018, those guarantees totaled $0.8 million of which $0.8 million was outstanding. At December 29, 2018, the Company was contingently obligated for approximately $21.0 million under letters of credit, primarily consisting of $12.6 million to support long-term debt, $7.9 million to support the casualty insurance program, $0.2 million to support repurchase obligations, and $0.3 million to support bonding agreements. The letters of credit are backed by a sub-facility under the New Credit Agreement. The Company was also contingently obligated for $29.8 million under surety bonds, generally to support performance on long-term construction contracts, license and service bonding requirements. In the normal course of business, the Company’s former subsidiaries that operated in the United Kingdom historically provided certain guarantees to two customers. Those guarantees provide contractual liability for proven construction defects up to 12 years from the date of delivery of certain products. The guarantees remain a contingent liability of the Company which declines over time through October 2027. As of the date of this report, no claims have been reported under the terms of the guarantees. Legal Proceedings The Company has agreed to indemnify counterparties in the ordinary course of its business in agreements to acquire and sell business assets and in financing arrangements. The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of its business. As of the date of this filing, the Company believes the ultimate liability with respect to these contingent obligations will not have, either individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 16 Item 2. MANAGEMENT’ S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following should be read in conjunction with Skyline Champion Corporation’s condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear in Item I of this Report. Overview Skyline Champion Corporation (prior to the Exchange (as described below) “Champion Holdings” and subsequent to the Exchange the “Company”) is a leading producer of factory-built housing in the U.S. and Canada. The Company serves as a complete solutions provider across complementary and vertically integrated businesses including manufactured construction, company-owned retail locations, and transportation logistics services. The Company is the second largest factory-built solutions provider in North America based on revenue and markets its homes under several nationally recognized brand names including Skyline Homes, Champion Homes, Redman Homes, Dutch Housing, Excel Homes, Silvercrest, Titan Homes, Moduline, and SRI Homes. The Company operates 31 manufacturing facilities throughout the U.S. and five manufacturing facilities in western Canada that primarily construct factory-built, timber-framed manufactured and modular houses that are sold primarily to independent retailers and builders/developers, including manufactured home community operators. The Company’s retail operations consist of 21 sales centers that sell manufactured homes to consumers primarily in the Southern U.S. The Company’s transportation business primarily engages independent owners/drivers to transport manufactured homes and recreational vehicles throughout the U.S. and Canada. Acquisitions and Expansions Over the last several years, market demand for the Company’s products, primarily affordable housing in the U.S., has continued to improve. As a result, the Company has focused on operational improvements to make existing manufacturing facilities more profitable as well as executing measured expansion of its manufacturing and retail footprint. In response to the increasing demand for factory-built housing in the U.S., the Company has increased capacity through strategic acquisitions and expansions of its manufacturing footprint. The Company is focused on growing in strong HUD-markets across the U.S. as well as further expanding into the Northeast and Midwest U.S. modular housing markets. During the third quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company completed its expansion of the Corona, California facility by adding a second production line. In October 2017, the Company entered into a lease for two factory-built housing plants in Leesville, Louisiana, one of which the Company expects to begin operations in June 2019. The Company is expanding is Leola, Pennsylvania campus and opening an additional plant with operations expected to begin in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. In April 2017, the Company completed the purchase of a factory-built housing plant in Mansfield, Texas, from Skyline Corporation. In September 2016, the Company, through a series of transactions, completed the purchase of the assets of Innovative Building Systems, LLC and Subsidiaries (“IBS” or “IBS Acquisition”), which included five modular manufacturing facilities and two retail sales centers in the Northeast and Midwest U.S. In January 2017, the Company restarted operations at the Liverpool, Pennsylvania location, one of the acquired modular facilities from IBS. The other former IBS facilities remain idle. In addition to these strategic acquisitions, during fiscal 2017, the Company leased and opened a manufacturing facility in Benton, Kentucky as well as reopened a previously idled facility in Topeka, Indiana. The Topeka facility began operations in February 2017. Production at the Benton facility began in August 2016. The Company has also focused on expansion of its company-owned retail operations, opening three additional retail sales centers during fiscal 2018, five during fiscal 2017 and three during fiscal 2016. Management believes retail expansion provides an opportunity to increase the Company’s presence in market segments that are not currently served through our independent retail network, while also providing for expansion and increased utilization of our existing manufacturing operations. These acquisitions and investments are part of a strategy to grow and diversify revenue with a focus on increasing the Company’s HUD and modular homebuilding presence in the U.S. as well as improving the results of operations. These acquisitions and investments are included in the consolidated results for periods subsequent to their respective acquisition dates. Combination with Skyline On January 5, 2018, Champion Holdings and the Company entered into the Exchange Agreement pursuant to which the two companies agreed to combine their operations. The Exchange was completed on June 1, 2018, and was accounted for as a reverse acquisition under the acquisition method of accounting as provided by FASB Accounting Standards Codification 805, Business Combinations (“ASC 805”). Champion Holdings was determined to be the acquirer for accounting and financial reporting purposes. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed by Champion Holdings as a result of the Exchange were recorded at their respective fair values and added to the carrying value of Champion Holdings existing assets and liabilities. As Champion Holdings is the accounting acquirer, reported financial results for Skyline Champion Corporation for the nine months ended December 29, 2018 comprise the results of only Champion Holdings through June 1, 2018 and the Company, after giving effect to the Exchange, from June 1, 2018 through December 29, 2018. All fiscal periods prior to June 1, 2018 are comprised solely of the results of Champion Holdings. 17 Industry and Company Outlook For the nine months ended December 29, 2018, approximately 76% of the Company’s U.S. manufacturing sales were generated from the manufacture of homes that comply with the Federal HUD-code construction standard in the U.S. The Company measures and reports on U.S. HUD market share one month in arrears. During the eight months ended November 30, 2018, industry shipments of HUD-code homes were 65,036 a 4.5% improvement over 62,255 units shipped in same period of the prior year. The Company’s HUD market share during that period was 16.2% versus 13.8% in the comparable period of the prior year. Sales of HUD-code homes have been increasing steadily since 2009, when 50,000 HUD-code homes were sold. Fewer factory-built homes were sold in 2009 than in any year since 1959. While HUD-code factory-built home shipments have improved modestly over the past few years, the industry continues to operate at relatively low levels compared to historical shipment statistics. For instance, the long-term average for manufactured home shipments since 1960 is 224,000 units per year. Industry shipments of modular homes in the U.S. during the Company’s fiscal 2018 totaled 14,287 units, reflecting a slight increase from shipments in the comparable period of 2017. Modular home sales across the industry have generally been stable since 2009. During the nine months ended December 29, 2018, approximately 19% of the Company’s U.S. manufacturing sales were modular. The Company’s modular home presence has improved due to the IBS Acquisition. Champion Holdings was headquartered in Troy, Michigan and was formed in 2010 as a Delaware limited liability company. Champion Holdings’ predecessor began operations in 1953. Subsequent to the Exchange, the Company is headquartered in Elkhart, Indiana. Pro Forma Results of Operations In addition to the analysis of historical results of operations, this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes unaudited supplemental pro forma results of operations for the nine months ended December 29, 2018 and the three and nine months ended December 30, 2017. The unaudited pro forma results of operations reflect pro forma adjustments to the results of the Company to give effect to the Exchange and the related financing transactions (the “Financing”) as if they had occurred on April 2, 2017, the beginning of the earliest period presented. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information of the Company combines the accounting periods of Champion Holdings and Skyline Corporation. Champion Holdings and Skyline Corporation had different fiscal year ends. Regulation S-X, Rule 11-02(c)(3) allows the combination of financial information for companies if their fiscal years end within 93 days of each other. Skyline Corporation’s results for three and nine months ended December 3, 2017 are included in the pro forma financial information below. Skyline Corporation’s results for these periods were derived from their unaudited consolidated income statements. Champion Holdings’ historical results are derived from Champion Holdings’ unaudited consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) for the nine months ended December 29, 2018 and for the three and nine months ended December 30, 2017. The unaudited pro forma adjustments include: • Adjustments to depreciation expense for the stepped-up basis of property, plant and equipment; • Adjustments to the amortization of intangible assets recognized in connection with the Exchange; • Adjustments to interest expense for the elimination of historical interest expense and amortization of deferred financing fees on retired debt; • Recognition of interest expense and amortization of deferred financing fees on the new revolving credit agreement; • Adjustments to eliminate expenses incurred directly related to the Exchange; • Adjustments to eliminate one-time equity-based compensation incurred directly related to the Exchange; • Adjustments to eliminate the net currency translation gains and losses on certain intercompany debt; • Adjustments to eliminate the management fee, plus reimbursable expenses, paid by Champion Holdings to its primary investors under a management service agreement; and • Adjustments to reflect tax expense for the unaudited pro forma adjustments. 18 Results of Operations: Three Months Ended December 29, 2018 vs. Three Months Ended December 30, 2017 Historical Pro Forma Three Months Ended Three Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) December 29, 2018 December 30, 2017 December 30, 2017 (unaudited) (unaudited) Results of Operations Data: Net sales $ 354,671 $ 294,378 $ 350,913 Cost of sales 289,935 238,118 286,723 Gross profit 64,736 56,260 64,190 Selling, general and administrative expenses 48,848 32,877 38,883 Operating income 15,888 23,383 25,307 Interest expense, net 813 999 902 Other expense 125 1,940 8 Income before income taxes 14,950 20,444 24,397 Income tax expense 4,437 15,051 15,976 Net income $ 10,513 $ 5,393 $ 8,421 Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA: Net income $ 10,513 $ 5,393 $ 8,421 Income tax expense 4,437 15,051 15,976 Interest expense, net 813 999 902 Depreciation and amortization 4,577 2,028 3,967 Equity-based compensation 3,662 150 227 Foreign currency transaction loss 155 93 8 Transaction costs — 1,937 — Acquisition integration costs 1,998 — — Restructuring charges 125 — — Gain on sale of non-operating facilities — — (762 ) Other 127 (11 ) 8 Adjusted EBITDA $ 26,407 $ 25,640 $ 28,747 As a percent of net sales: Gross profit 18.3 % 19.1 % 18.3 % Selling, general and administrative expenses 13.8 % 11.2 % 11.1 % Operating income 4.5 % 7.9 % 7.2 % Net income 3.0 % 1.8 % 2.4 % Adjusted EBITDA 7.4 % 8.7 % 8.2 % Net Sales: The following table summarizes net sales for the three months ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017: Three Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) December 29, 2018 December 30, 2017 Change % Change (unaudited) Net sales $ 354,671 $ 294,378 $ 60,293 20.5 % U.S. manufacturing and retail net sales $ 309,518 $ 242,739 $ 66,779 27.5 % U.S. homes sold 5,019 4,289 730 17.0 % U.S. manufacturing and retail average home selling price $ 61.7 $ 56.6 $ 5.1 9.0 % Canadian manufacturing net sales $ 27,130 $ 24,950 $ 2,180 8.7 % Canadian homes sold 329 323 6 1.9 % Canadian manufacturing average home selling price $ 82.5 $ 77.2 $ 5.2 6.8 % Corporate/Other net sales $ 18,023 $ 26,689 $ (8,666 ) (32.5 %) U.S. manufacturing facilities in operation at end of period 31 23 8 34.8 % U.S. retail sales centers in operation at end of period 21 21 — — % Canadian manufacturing facilities in operation at end of period 5 5 — — % 19 Net Sales: Net sales for the three months ended December 29, 2018 were $354.7 million, an increase of $60.3 million, or 20.5% over the three months ended December 30, 2017. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. U.S. Factory-built Housing: The U.S. Factory-built Housing segment accounted for the majority of the overall growth in net sales for the three months ended December 29, 2018 compared to the same period in the prior year. Sales of homes for the Company’s U.S. manufacturing and retail operations increased by $66.8 million, or 27.5%. The number of homes sold during the three months ended December 29, 2018 increased by 730 units, or 17.0%. The net sales increase was attributable to the following factors including: (i) the inclusion of net sales of $63.2 million for the Skyline operations; and (ii) a 9.0% increase in the average home selling price as a result of increased market demand, product mix and pricing actions to offset the impact of rising material and labor costs. Prior year results for the three months ended December 30, 2017 included the sale of 934 disaster relief homes produced for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (“FEMA”). The Company measures and reports on U.S. HUD market share one month in arrears. The Company’s U.S. HUD market share for the three months ended November 30, 2018 grew to 18.1% from 14.0% in the same period of the prior year due to the inclusion of Skyline operations. U.S. HUD industry units shipped during the three months ended November 30, 2018 decreased 3.9% from the same period in the prior year. U.S. HUD industry shipments for the three months ended November 30, 2017 included 1,913 FEMA disaster relief homes, according to data published by the Manufactured Housing Institute. Canadian Factory-built Housing: The Canadian Factory-built Housing segment net sales increased by $2.2 million, or 8.7% for the three months ended December 29, 2018 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to increased units sold of 1.9% and in part by a 6.8% increase in average selling price, which was primarily the result of pricing actions taken by the Company to offset the impact of rising material and labor costs consistent with those experienced in the U.S. Net sales had an unfavorable impact of $1.0 million as a result of changes in exchange rates utilized for translation of Canadian dollars to U.S. dollars during the three months ended December 29, 2018 as compared to the same period of the prior year. Backlog: Although orders from customers can be cancelled at any time without penalty, and unfilled orders are not necessarily an indication of future business, the Company’s unfilled U.S. and Canadian manufacturing orders for homes at December 29, 2018 totaled $181 million compared to $169 million at December 30, 2017. The increase is as a result of including the former Skyline operations for the current period. Corporate/Other: Net sales for Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation business and the elimination of intersegment sales. For the three months ended December 29, 2018, net sales decreased $8.7 million, or 32.5%. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower net sales in our transportation business primarily as a result of lower shipments associated with reduced RV demand in the U.S. Gross Profit: The following table summarizes gross profit for the three months ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017: Three Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) December 29, 2018 December 30, 2017 Change % Change (unaudited) Gross profit: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 57,118 $ 48,426 $ 8,692 17.9 % Canadian Factory-built Housing 5,046 4,466 580 13.0 % Corporate/Other 2,572 3,368 (796 ) (23.6 %) Total gross profit $ 64,736 $ 56,260 $ 8,476 15.1 % Gross profit as a percent of net sales 18.3 % 19.1 % Gross Profit: Gross profit as a percent of sales during the three months ended December 29, 2018 was 18.3% compared to 19.1% during the three months ended December 30, 2017. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. 20 U.S. Factory-built Housing: Gross profit for the U.S. Factory-built Housing segment increased by $8.7 million, or 17.9%, during the three months ended December 29, 2018 compared to the same period in the prior year and decreased to 18.5% as a percent of segment net sales from 19.9%. During the three months ended December 30, 2017, the Company produced 934 disaster relief homes for FEMA. These standard FEMA floor plans allowed the Company to achieve higher than typical production efficiencies. The Company continues to standardize its core product design and material purchases which allow for more efficient production for its supply chain and helps to mitigate material commodity inflation. The Company also continues to focus on better understanding its cost structure and discontinuing models and options that customers do not value. As a result of these efforts, the U.S. manufacturing plants have been able to increase output of its core residential products. Canadian Factory-built Housing: Gross profit for the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment increased $0.6 million, or 13.0%, during the three months ended December 29, 2018 compared to the same period in the prior year and increased to 18.6% as a percent of segment net sales from 17.9%. The increase in gross profit margin as a percent of net sales is primarily due to lower average labor and benefits as well as improved warranty costs. Corporate/Other: Gross profit for the Corporate/Other segment decreased $0.8 million, or 23.6%, during the three months ended December 29, 2018 compared to the same period in the prior year. Corporate/Other gross profit improved as a percent of segment net sales to 14.3% from 12.6%. Although the transportation business volume was lower, margins improved in part due to less brokered business to other providers at lower margins.

U.S Factory-built Housing: Selling, general and administrative expenses for the U.S. Factory-built Housing segment increased $8.2 million, or 36.6%, during the three months ended December 29, 2018 as compared to the three months ended December 30, 2017. The increase was primarily a result of including $5.8 million of costs related to the inclusion of the Skyline operations subsequent to the Exchange, $1.4 million of higher sales commissions and incentive compensation (which is generally based on sales volume or a measure of profitability), and $1.0 million of other administrative and marketing costs. As a result of the increases above, selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percent of net sales, was 9.9% for the three months ended December 29, 2018 compared to 9.2% during the three months ended December 30, 2017.

As a percent of segment net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses for the Canadian segment was 10.3% for the three months ended December 29, 2018 compared to 11.7% for the three months ended December 30, 2017. Corporate/Other: Selling, general and administrative expenses for Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation operations, corporate costs incurred for all segments and intersegment eliminations. Selling, general and administrative expenses for Corporate/Other increased $7.9 million 21 during the three months ended December 29, 2018 as compared to the three months ended December 30, 2017 . The increase is primarily a result of including $1.1 million of costs related to the inclusion of the Skyline operations subsequent to the Exchan ge, $ 3.7 million of non-cash, equity-based compensation expense , $2.0 million of Skyline integration costs and $1. 1 million of legal and professional fees .

The decrease was primarily related to higher interest income recognized during the period as a result of higher average cash balances invested in short term facilities. Other Expense: The following table summarizes other expense for the three months ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017: Three Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) December 29, 2018 December 30, 2017 Change % Change (unaudited) Other expense $ 125 $ 1,940 $ (1,815 ) (93.6 %) Other Expense: Other expense for the three months ended December 29, 2018 primarily consisted of $0.1 million for the deductible on an insured loss at one of the Company’s retail sales centers.

The Company’s effective tax rate for the three months ended December 29, 2018 differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of 21.0%, due primarily to the effect of non-deductible expenses, state and local income taxes, and results in foreign jurisdictions. The Company’s effective tax rate for the three months ended December 30, 2017 differed from the blended federal statutory rate of 31.5% primarily due to the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new corporate income tax rate of 21%, from 35% due to the Tax Act as well as the effect of non-deductible expense, state and local income taxes, and results of operations in foreign jurisdictions and non-taxable entities. 22 Adjusted EBITDA: The following table reconciles net income, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, to Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the three months ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 201 7 : Historical Pro Forma Three Months Ended Three Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) December 29, 2018 December 30, 2017 Change December 29, 2018 (a) December 30, 2017 Change (unaudited) (unaudited) Net income $ 10,513 $ 5,393 $ 5,120 $ 10,513 $ 8,421 $ 2,092 Income tax expense 4,437 15,051 (10,614 ) 4,437 15,976 (11,539 ) Interest expense, net 813 999 (186 ) 813 902 (89 ) Depreciation and amortization 4,577 2,028 2,549 4,577 3,967 610 Equity-based compensation 3,662 150 3,512 3,662 227 3,435 Foreign currency transaction loss 155 93 62 155 8 147 Transaction costs — 1,937 (1,937 ) — — — Acquisition integration costs 1,998 — 1,998 1,998 — 1,998 Restructuring charges 125 — 125 125 — 125 Gain on sale of non-operating facilities — — — — (762 ) 762 Other 127 (11 ) 138 127 8 119 Adjusted EBITDA $ 26,407 $ 25,640 $ 767 $ 26,407 $ 28,747 $ (2,340 ) ( a ) Adjusted EBITDA for three months ended December 29, 2018 is on an as reported basis. Adjusted EBITDA: Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended December 29, 2018 was $26.4 million, an increase of $0.8 million over the three months ended December 30, 2017. The increase is primarily a result of increased operating income of $0.7 million after adjusting for the effect of increased depreciation and amortization, integration, restructuring costs and non-cash equity-based compensation incurred in connection with the Exchange and integration of Skyline. The increase in operating income is primarily due to improvements in sales volumes and gross profit margins as a percent of net sales partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative costs. Adjusted EBITDA is presented as a supplemental measure of the Company’s financial performance to clarify and enhance an understanding of the historical results of the Company’s business. The Company’s management believes that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA enhances an investor’s understanding of the Company’s financial performance and that Adjusted EBITDA is a useful financial metric to assess the Company’s operating performance from period-to-period by excluding certain items that the Company believes are not representative of its core business. The Company uses Adjusted EBITDA for business planning purposes and in measuring its performance relative to that of its competitors. 23 Nine Months Ended December 29, 2018 vs. Nine M onths Ended December 30, 2017 Historical Pro Forma Nine Months Ended Nine Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) December 29, 2018 December 30, 2017 December 29, 2018 December 30, 2017 (unaudited) (unaudited) Results of Operations Data: Net sales $ 1,032,368 $ 798,443 $ 1,078,172 $ 972,903 Cost of sales 853,472 664,824 891,573 817,330 Gross profit 178,896 133,619 186,599 155,573 Selling, general and administrative expenses 222,005 87,439 218,807 106,990 Operating (loss) income (43,109 ) 46,180 (32,208 ) 48,583 Interest expense, net 2,712 3,164 2,597 2,909 Other expense 7,845 2,863 1,432 91 (Loss) income before income taxes (53,666 ) 40,153 (36,237 ) 45,583 Income tax expense 13,699 22,089 16,019 23,302 Net (loss) income $ (67,365 ) $ 18,064 $ (52,256 ) $ 22,281 Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA: Net (loss) income $ (67,365 ) $ 18,064 $ (52,256 ) $ 22,281 Income tax expense 13,699 22,089 16,019 23,302 Interest expense, net 2,712 3,164 2,597 2,909 Depreciation and amortization 11,535 6,126 12,700 11,943 Equity-based compensation 97,589 450 89,702 649 Foreign currency transaction loss (gain) 188 (1,140 ) 188 (220 ) Transaction costs 6,905 2,831 492 — Acquisition integration costs 5,500 — 5,500 — Equity offering costs 816 — 816 — Elkhart and Mansfield plant closures — — — 1,132 Restructuring charges 1,236 — 828 — Gain on sale of non-operating facilities — — — (1,982 ) Other 126 33 534 105 Adjusted EBITDA $ 72,941 $ 51,617 $ 77,120 $ 60,119 As a percent of net sales: Gross profit 17.3 % 16.7 % 17.3 % 16.0 % Selling, general and administrative expenses 21.5 % 11.0 % 20.3 % 11.0 % Operating (loss) income (4.2 %) 5.8 % (3.0 %) 5.0 % Net (loss) income (6.5 %) 2.3 % (4.8 %) 2.3 % Adjusted EBITDA 7.1 % 6.5 % 7.2 % 6.2 % Net Sales: The following table summarizes net sales for the nine months ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017: Nine Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) December 29, 2018 December 30, 2017 Change % Change (unaudited) Net sales $ 1,032,368 $ 798,443 $ 233,925 29.3 % U.S. manufacturing and retail net sales $ 882,257 $ 641,878 $ 240,379 37.4 % U.S. homes sold 14,606 12,038 2,568 21.3 % U.S. manufacturing and retail average home selling price $ 60.4 $ 53.3 $ 7.1 13.3 % Canadian manufacturing net sales $ 79,885 $ 74,006 $ 5,879 7.9 % Canadian homes sold 1,003 988 15 1.5 % Canadian manufacturing average home selling price $ 79.6 $ 74.9 $ 4.7 6.3 % Corporate/Other net sales $ 70,226 $ 82,559 $ (12,333 ) (14.9 %) U.S. manufacturing facilities in operation at end of period 31 23 8 34.8 % U.S. retail sales centers in operation at end of period 21 21 — — % Canadian manufacturing facilities in operation at end of period 5 5 — — % 24 Historical Net Sales: Net sales for the nine months ended December 29, 2018 were $1,032.4 million, an increase of $233.9 million, or 29.3% over the nine months ended December 30, 2017. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. U.S. Factory-built Housing: The U.S. Factory-built Housing segment accounted for the majority of the overall growth in net sales for the nine months ended December 29, 2018 compared to the same period in the prior year. Sales of homes for the Company’s U.S. manufacturing and retail operations increased by $240.4 million, or 37.4%. The number of homes sold during the nine months ended December 29, 2018 increased by 2,568 units, or 21.3%. The net sales increase was attributable to several factors including: (i) the inclusion of net sales of $153.3 million for the Skyline operations for the period following the completion of the Exchange; (ii) a 13.3% increase in the average home selling price as a result of increased market demand, product mix and pricing actions to offset the impact of rising material and labor costs; and (iii) increased output at the Company’s existing facilities as a result of plant operating improvements. The Company measures and reports on U.S. HUD market share one month in arrears. The Company’s U.S. HUD market share for the eight months ended November 30, 2018 grew to 16.2% from 13.8% in the same period of the prior year due to the inclusion of the Skyline operations. The U.S. HUD market grew during the nine months ended November 30, 2018, as shipments of factory-built HUD homes were 4.5% higher than the same period of the prior year. Canadian Factory-built Housing: The Canadian Factory-built Housing segment sales increased $5.9 million, or 7.9% for the nine months ended December 29, 2018 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to an increase in the average home selling price of 6.3% and a 1.5% increase in number of units sold. Net sales had an unfavorable impact of $0.7 million as a result of changes in exchange rates utilized for translation of Canadian dollars to U.S. dollars during the nine months ended December 29, 2018 as compared to the same period of the prior year. Corporate/Other: Net sales for Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation business and the elimination of intersegment sales. For the nine months ended December 29, 2018, net sales decreased $12.3 million, or 14.9%. The decrease in net sales for Corporate/Other was a result of a decrease in our transportation business caused by lower demand, and therefore reduced shipments of RVs in the U.S. Pro Forma Net Sales: Pro forma net sales for the nine months ended December 29, 2018 were $1,078.2 million compared to $972.9 million, an increase of 10.8%. The increase was attributable to a number of factors including plant operating improvements which led to increased output; and an increase in the average home selling price as a result of increased market demand and pricing actions to offset the impact of rising material and labor costs.

Although material prices and labor costs have been increasing in recent periods, the Company has been able to offset the margin effect of those increases with price adjustments, operational improvements and product rationalization. The Company continues to standardize product design and material purchases which allow for more efficient production for its supply chain and help to mitigate material commodity inflation. The Company also continues to focus on better understanding its cost structure and discontinuing models and options that customers do not value. As a result of these efforts, the U.S. manufacturing plants have been able to increase output which allows for better leverage of fixed costs. Canadian Factory-built Housing: Gross profit for the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment increased $1.2 million, or 8.6%, during the nine months ended December 29, 2018 compared to the same period in the prior year and increased to 18.8% as a percent of segment net sales from 18.7%. The increase in gross profit as a percent of net sales is primarily due to decreasing warranty costs. Corporate/Other: Corporate/Other gross profit decreased $0.8 million, or 6.7%, during the nine months ended December 29, 2018 compared to the same period in the prior year and improved as a percent of segment net sales to 15.3% from 14.0%. Although the transportation business volume was lower, margins improved in part due to less brokered business to other providers at lower margins. Pro Forma Gross Profit: Pro forma gross profit increased $31.0 million during the nine months ended December 29, 2018 compared to the same period of the prior year and improved as a percent of net sales to 17.3% from 16.0%. The increase in gross profit as a percent of net sales is consistent with the operational improvements and product rationalization actions taken by the Company. The continued standardization of product design and material purchases has allowed for more efficient production for the Company and its supply chain and helped to mitigate the effects of commodity and labor inflation occurring in the market place.

Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of segment net sales was 9.4% for both the nine months ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017. The increase was a result of including $12.7 million of costs related to the inclusion of the Skyline operations subsequent to the Exchange. The remaining increase, excluding the addition of the Skyline operations, was the result of: (i) $6.1 million of higher sales commissions and incentive compensation, which is generally based on sales volume or a measure of profitability; (ii) $1.2 million increase in salaries and benefits, generally a result of increased compensation and administrative headcount to facilitate expanding capacity; and (iii) other administrative expenses. 26 Canadian Factory-built Housing: Selling, general and administrative expenses for the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment increased $0.6 million, or 9.1%, during the nine months ended December 29, 2018 as compared to the nine months ended December 30, 2017.

Selling, general and administrative expenses for Corporate/Other increased $111.2 million during the nine months ended December 29, 2018 as compared to the nine months ended December 30, 2017. The increase is primarily due to $97.2 million of non-cash, equity-based compensation expense, an additional $5.5 million in integration costs and $1.2 million of restructuring costs. Salaries, benefits and incentive compensation were $2.7 million higher during the nine months ended December 29, 2018, as a result of the inclusion of Skyline administrative staff, additional staffing to support growth, and increased incentive compensation, which is generally based on a measure of profitability. Pro Forma Selling, General and Administrative Expenses: Pro forma selling, general and administrative expenses were $218.8 million for the nine months ended December 29, 2018 compared to $107.0 million for the nine months ended December 30, 2017. The increase was primarily the result of an increase of $89.0 million of non-cash, equity-based compensation expense and an increase in salaries and benefits, sales-based and incentive compensation and other administrative costs discussed above. The increase is also a result of the $5.5 million of integration and $0.8 million of restructuring costs incurred in connection with the integration of the Skyline operations included in the nine months ended December 29, 2018. Interest Expense, Net: The following table summarizes the components of interest expense, net for the nine months ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017: Nine Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) December 29, 2018 December 30, 2017 Change % Change (unaudited) Interest expense $ 4,007 $ 3,783 $ 224 5.9 % Interest income (1,295 ) (619 ) (676 ) (109.2 %) Interest expense, net $ 2,712 $ 3,164 $ (452 ) (14.3 %) Average outstanding floor plan payable $ 31,596 $ 21,739 Average outstanding long-term debt $ 59,258 $ 59,604 Historical Interest Expense, Net: Interest expense, net was $0.5 million lower for the nine months ended December 29, 2018 compared to the same period of the prior year. Interest expense increased $0.2 million as a result of the increase in average outstanding borrowings on floor plan financing arrangements. Floor plan payables are used to finance retail inventory at company-owned retail sales centers and the increase in outstanding borrowings is consistent with the expanded retail footprint for the U.S. retail operations discussed above. Interest income increased $0.7 million as a result of an increase in interest generated from a higher average cash balances invested in short-term facilities. Pro Forma Interest Expense, Net: Pro forma interest expense, net was $2.6 million for the nine months ended December 29, 2018, a decrease of $0.3 million from the same period of the prior year. The overall decrease is primarily attributable to additional interest income earned from higher average cash balances invested in short-term facilities. Other Expense: The following table summarizes other expense for the nine months ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017: Nine Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) December 29, 2018 December 30, 2017 Change % Change (unaudited) Other expense $ 7,845 $ 2,863 $ 4,982 174.0 % 27 Historical Other Expense: Other expense for the nine months ended December 29, 2018 primarily consists of $6.9 million of expenses for legal, accounting and advisory services related to the Exchange. The Company also incurred $0.8 million of expenses during the period for legal, accounting and advisory services related to the Offerings. During the nine months ended December 30, 2017, the Company incurred $2.8 million of expenses attributable to the Exchange and $0.1 million related to a prior acquisition and the disposition of a former business unit in the United Kingdom. Pro Forma Other Expense: Other expense for the nine months ended December 29, 2018 consists of $0.5 million of expenses for legal, accounting and advisory services attributable to the Exchange, $0.8 million of expense for legal, accounting and advisory services related to the equity offerings, and $0.1 million for the deductible on an insured loss at one of the Company’s retail sales centers. Other expense for the nine months ended December 30, 2017 included $0.1 million of expenses related to the IBS Acquisition and the disposition of a former business unit in the United Kingdom. Income Tax Expense: The following table summarizes income tax expense for the nine months ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017: Nine Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) December 29, 2018 December 30, 2017 Change % Change (unaudited) Income tax expense $ 13,699 $ 22,089 $ (8,390 ) (38.0 %) Effective tax rate (25.5 %) 55.0 % Historical Income Tax Expense: Income tax expense for the nine months ended December 29, 2018 was $13.7 million, representing an effective tax rate of (25.5)%, compared to income tax expense of $22.1 million, representing an effective tax rate of 55.0%, for the nine months ended December 30, 2017. The Company’s effective tax rate for the nine months ended December 29, 2018 differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of 21.0%, due primarily to the effect of one-time charges related to the Exchange, non-deductible expenses, state and local income taxes, and results of operations in foreign jurisdictions and non-taxable entities. Absent these non-deductible discrete items primarily related to the Exchange, the Company’s effective tax rate would have been 32.0%. The Company’s effective tax rate for the nine months ended December 30, 2017 differed from the blended federal statutory rate of 31.5% primarily due to the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new corporate income tax rate of 21%, from 35%, under the Tax Act as well as the effect of non-deductible expenses, state and local income taxes, and results of operations in foreign jurisdictions and non-taxable entities. Pro Forma Income Tax Expense: During the nine months ended December 29, 2018, the Company had pro forma income tax expense of $16.0 million and an effective tax rate of (44.2%), compared to income tax expense of $23.3 million and an effective tax rate of 51.1% during the same period of the prior year. Prior to the completion of the Exchange, Skyline recognized no income tax expense or benefit as a result of historical operating loss carryforwards which had a full valuation allowance. A portion of the valuation allowance was reversed upon completion of the Exchange, however, that reversal did not have an impact on the pro forma results of operations. The pro forma income tax effects are a result of the income tax effects of the Company discussed above plus the tax impact of the pro forma adjustments. The increase in expense for the nine months ended December 29, 2018 is primarily a result of the non-deductibility of certain expenses for tax purposes. 28 Adjusted EBITDA: The following table reconciles net income, the most di rectly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, to Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the nine months ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 : Historical Pro Forma Nine Months Ended Nine Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) December 29, 2018 December 30, 2017 Change December 29, 2018 December 30, 2017 Change (unaudited) (unaudited) Net (loss) income $ (67,365 ) $ 18,064 $ (85,429 ) $ (52,256 ) $ 22,281 $ (74,537 ) Income tax expense 13,699 22,089 (8,390 ) 16,019 23,302 (7,283 ) Interest expense, net 2,712 3,164 (452 ) 2,597 2,909 (312 ) Depreciation and amortization 11,535 6,126 5,409 12,700 11,943 757 Equity-based compensation 97,589 450 97,139 89,702 649 89,053 Foreign currency loss (gain) 188 (1,140 ) 1,328 188 (220 ) 408 Transaction costs 6,905 2,831 4,074 492 — 492 Acquisition integration costs 5,500 — 5,500 5,500 — 5,500 Equity offering costs 816 — 816 816 — 816 Elkhart and Mansfield plant closures — — — — 1,132 (1,132 ) Restructuring charges 1,236 — 1,236 828 — 828 Gain on sale of non-operating facilities — — — — (1,982 ) 1,982 Other 126 33 93 534 105 429 Adjusted EBITDA $ 72,941 $ 51,617 $ 21,324 $ 77,120 $ 60,119 $ 17,001 Historical Adjusted EBITDA: Adjusted EBITDA for the nine months ended December 29, 2018 was $72.9 million, an increase of $21.3 million over the nine months ended December 30, 2017. The increase is primarily a result of an increase in operating income of $20.0 million after adjusting for the effect of increased depreciation and amortization, integration, restructuring costs and non-cash equity-based compensation incurred in connection with the Exchange and integration of Skyline. The increase in operating income is primarily due to the improvement in sales volumes and gross profit margins as a percent of net sales, partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative costs as a result of growth. Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA: Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA for the nine months ended December 29, 2018 was $77.1 million, an increase of $17.0 million over the nine months ended December 30, 2017. The increase is primarily a result of an increase in operating income of $15.3 million after adjusting for the effect of increased depreciation and amortization, integration, and restructuring costs incurred in connection with the integration of Skyline. Adjusted EBITDA is presented as a supplemental measure of the Company’s financial performance to clarify and enhance an understanding of the historical results of the Company’s business. The Company’s management believes that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA enhances an investor’s understanding of the Company’s financial performance and that Adjusted EBITDA is a useful financial metric to assess the Company’s operating performance from period-to-period by excluding certain items that the Company believes are not representative of its core business. The Company uses Adjusted EBITDA for business planning purposes and in measuring its performance relative to that of its competitors. Liquidity and Capital Resources Sources and Uses of Cash The following table presents summary cash flow information for the nine months ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017: Nine Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) December 29, 2018 December 30, 2017 (unaudited) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 51,918 $ (671 ) Investing activities 2,396 (7,610 ) Financing activities (60,815 ) 5,780 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents (1,130 ) 1,557 Net decrease in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (7,631 ) (944 ) Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at beginning of period 136,616 102,692 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at end of period $ 128,985 $ 101,748 29 Our primary sources of liquidity are net cash provided by operating activities and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility. At December 29, 2018, we had $129.0 million of cash and cash equivalents and $32.1 million of unused borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility, net of the required letter of credit sub-facility. The Company believes that net cash generated from operating activities, cash on hand, available borrowings under our revolving credit facility and available capital through access to capital markets will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital requirements needed to operate the business for the next year. In the event that those sources of cash are inadequate and one or more capital resources were to become unavailable, the Company would revise operating strategies accordingly. Cash and cash equivalents decreased by $7.6 million during the nine months ended December 29, 2018. The decrease was primarily a result of distributions to Champion Holdings’ members prior to the completion of the Exchange partially offset by cash generated by operating activities and cash assumed in the business acquisition. Although net income decreased $85.4 million during the nine months ended December 29, 2018 compared to the same period of the prior year, cash generated from operating activities was $52.6 million higher. The increase was primarily the result of an increase in net cash flows generated by operating income after adjusting for non-cash effects of depreciation, amortization and equity-based compensation resulting from the Exchange and cash provided from changes in working capital items which was $41.9 million more than last year. Working capital was negatively impacted on a temporary basis during the nine months ended December 30, 2017 due to the impact of FEMA orders. Cash provided by investing activities was $10.0 million higher during the nine months ended December 29, 2018 as a result of cash received from the Exchange of $9.7 million. Cash used in financing activities was $66.6 million higher during the nine months ended December 29, 2018, primarily as a result of distributions to Champion Holdings’ members of $65.3 million prior to completion of the Exchange and $2.0 million of additional payments made for deferred financing fees. The Company also borrowed $46.9 million under the New Credit Agreement during the nine months ended December 29, 2018 and used the proceeds to repay the existing Term Loans. Adjusted EBITDA The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss plus (a) the provision for income taxes, (b) interest expense, net, (c) depreciation and amortization, (d) gain or loss from discontinued operations, (e) foreign currency gains and losses, (f) equity-based compensation, (g) restructuring charges and impairment of assets, and (h) other non-operating costs including those for the acquisition and integration or disposition of businesses and idle facilities. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of earnings calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income or loss, net sales, operating income or earnings per share prepared on a U.S. GAAP basis. The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA is commonly used by investors to evaluate its performance and that of its competitors. However, the Company’s use of Adjusted EBITDA may vary from that of others in its industry. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, investors should be aware that in the future the Company may incur expenses similar to those adjusted for in this presentation. This presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that the Company’s future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items. Adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are: Adjusted EBITDA: • does not reflect the interest expense on our debt; • excludes impairments; and • does not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; • although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and • other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our U.S. GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures only on a supplemental basis. 30 Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Assumptions and estimates of future earnings and cash flow are used in the periodic analyses of the recoverability of goodwill, intangible assets, deferred tax assets and property, plant and equipment. Historical experience and trends are used to estimate reserves, including reserves for self-insured risks, warranty costs and product liability claims. For a discussion of our significant accounting policies and critical accounting estimates, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Policies,” attached as Exhibit 99.1 to the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on July 13, 2018, and Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” to the consolidated financial statements attached as Exhibit 99.1 to the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K/A filed with the SEC on June 14, 2018. There have been no significant changes in our significant accounting policies or critical accounting estimates during the nine months ended December 29, 2018, with the exception of revenue recognition. See Note 10, “Revenue Recognition,” to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this “Report”). Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements For information on the impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note 1, “Basis of Presentation – Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements,” to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Report. 31 Forward-Looking Statements Some of the statements in this Report are not historical in nature are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include statements about our expectations regarding our future liquidity, earnings, expenditures, and financial condition. These statements are often identified by the words “will,” “should,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “expect,” “intend,” “estimate,” “hope,” or similar expressions. These statements reflect management’s current views with respect to future events and are subject to risks and uncertainties. There are important factors, many of which are beyond our control, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forward-looking statements including regional, national or global political, economic, business, competitive, market and regulatory conditions and the following: • local, regional, national and international economic and financial market conditions and the impact they may have on the Company and our customers and our assessment of that impact; • demand fluctuations in the U.S. and Canadian housing industry; • the impact of customer preferences; • regulations pertaining to the housing and park model RV industries; • general or seasonal weather conditions affecting sales; • the potential impact of natural disasters on sales and raw material costs; • the prices and availability of materials; • periodic inventory adjustments by, and changes to relationships with, independent retailers; • changes in interest and foreign exchange rates; • more stringent credit standards or financing terms may be imposed by lenders on us, our dealers or customers; • the ability to service debt; • the impact of inflation; • the impact of labor costs, shortage, and turnover; • competitive pressures on pricing and promotional costs; • the availability of insurance coverage and changes in insurance costs; • the timely development and acceptance of new products and services and perceived overall value of these products and services by others; • greater than expected costs or difficulties related to the integration of new products and lines of business; • acquisitions and the integration of acquired businesses; • the effect of changes in laws and regulations with which we must comply; • the effect of changes in accounting policies and practices and auditing requirements; and • management’s ability to attract and retain executive officers and key personnel. The forward-looking statements in this Report are made as of the date hereof, and we do not assume any obligation to update, amend or clarify them to reflect events, new information or circumstances occurring after the date hereof. 32 Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATI VE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Risk The Company’s obligations under the New Credit Agreement, industrial revenue bonds and floor plan financing agreements are currently subject to variable rates of interest. A 100-basis point increase in the underlying interest rates would result in an additional annual interest expense of approximately $1.0 million, assuming average related debt of $98.3 million, which was the amount of outstanding borrowings under the facilities at December 29, 2018. The Company’s approach to interest rate risk is to balance borrowings between fixed rate and variable rate debt as management deems appropriate. Foreign Exchange Risk The Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk with its factory-built housing operations in Canada. The Canadian operations had net sales of $104.0 million Canadian dollars for the nine months ended December 29, 2018. Assuming future Canadian net sales are equal to those in the first nine months of fiscal 2019, a change of 1.0% in exchange rates between the U.S. and Canadian dollars would change quarterly consolidated net sales by $1.0 million. Net income of the Canadian operations would also be affected by changes in exchange rates. The Company also has foreign exchange risk for cash balances maintained in Canadian dollars that are subject to fluctuating values when exchanged into U.S. dollars. The Company does not financially hedge its investment in the Canadian operations or in Canadian denominated bank deposits. Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES The Company’s management, with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of December 29, 2018. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 29, 2018, due to the material weakness in internal controls over financial reporting described below, which has not been remediated. Notwithstanding the material weakness in internal controls over financial reporting, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q present fairly, in all material respects, the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with U.S. GAAP. On June 1, 2018, Champion Holdings completed a strategic business combination with Skyline to form Skyline Champion Corporation. The internal control over financial reporting of Champion Holdings (and its subsidiaries), including that portion of disclosure controls and procedures that relates to internal control over financial reporting, was excluded from the evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of the period end covered by this report. The total revenue of Champion Holdings represented approximately 85.1% of Skyline Champion Corporation’s consolidated revenue for the nine months ended December 29, 2018. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting As described in the Skyline Corporation’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended May 31, 2017, management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2017 and the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, the deficiencies in the Company’s controls related to raw material inventories described below constituted a material weakness and that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting. Accuracy and Valuation of Inventory – As of May 31, 2017, the Company’s internal controls over the accuracy and valuation of raw materials inventories did not operate with sufficient precision to prevent or detect the potential occurrence of material misstatement in compiling the raw material inventory listing from the physical inventory counts or in the valuation of raw materials at cost under the first-in, first-out method. Planned remediation of material weakness – The Company has been engaged in, and will continue to implement, remedial activities to address the control deficiency described above. To remediate the material weakness described above, the Company is establishing policies and procedures for the review, approval and application of generally accepted accounting principles pertaining to the accuracy and valuation of inventory, including implementing more robust inventory count procedures, count testing, analytical procedures and price testing. As the Company continues to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, the Company may determine to take additional measures to address its material weakness or determine to modify the remediation efforts described above. Until the remediation efforts discussed above, including any additional remediation efforts that the Company identifies as necessary, are implemented, tested and deemed to be operating effectively, the material weakness described above will continue to exist. We intend to describe changes in internal controls made as a result of the Exchange in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending March 30, 2019, which will include our initial assessment of internal controls over financial reporting for the combined business. 33 PART II – OTHE R INFORMATION Item 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS We are involved from time to time in various legal proceedings and claims, including, without limitation, commercial or contractual disputes, product liability claims and other matters. For additional information on legal proceedings, see Note 17, “Commitments, Contingencies and Legal Proceedings – Legal Proceedings,” to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Report. Item 1A. RISK FACTORS The factory-built housing industry is cyclical, is affected by seasonality and is sensitive to changes in general economic or other business conditions. The factory-built housing industry is affected by seasonality. Sales during the period from March to November are typically higher than in other months. As a result, the Company’s sales and operating results sometimes fluctuate and may continue to fluctuate in the future. The factory-built housing industry is also sensitive to changes in economic conditions and other factors, such as employment rates, job growth, population growth, consumer confidence, consumer income, availability of financing, interest rate levels and an oversupply of homes for sale. Changes in any of these conditions generally, or in the markets where the Company operates, could reduce demand and constrain pricing for new factory-built homes in these areas or result in customer cancellations of pending shipments. Reductions in the number of homes shipped by the Company or constraints on the prices it can charge, could result in a decrease in the Company’s net sales and earnings, which could adversely affect the Company’s financial condition. The Company is subject to demand fluctuations in the housing industry. Reductions in demand could adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations, and financial condition. Demand for the Company’s homes is subject to fluctuations in the housing market generally. In a housing market downturn, the Company’s sales and results of operations could be adversely affected; it may have significant inventory impairments and other write-offs; its gross margins may decline significantly from historical levels; and it may incur losses from operations. The Company cannot predict the continuation of the current housing recovery, nor can it provide assurance that should the recovery not continue its response will be successful. Future increases in interest rates, more stringent credit standards, tightening of financing terms, or other increases in the effective costs of owning a factory-built home (including those related to regulation or other government actions) could limit the purchasing power of the Company’s potential customers and could adversely affect the Company’s business and financial results. A large majority of the Company’s customers finance their home purchases through third-party lenders. While interest rates have increased moderately, they have been near historical lows for several years, which has made purchasing new factory-built homes more affordable. Increases in interest rates or decreases in the availability of consumer financing could adversely affect the market for homes. Potential customers may be less willing or able to pay the increased monthly costs or to obtain financing. Lenders may increase the qualifications needed for financing or adjust their terms to address any increased credit risk. These factors could adversely affect the sales or pricing of the Company’s factory-built homes. These developments have historically had, and may once again have, an adverse effect on the overall demand for factory-built housing and its competitiveness with other forms of housing, and could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition. The liquidity provided by Government-Sponsored Enterprises (“GSEs”) and the Federal Housing Administration (“FHA”) is also critical in insuring or purchasing home mortgages and creating or insuring investment securities that are either sold to investors or held in their portfolios. The impact of the federal government’s conservatorship of GSEs on the short-term and long-term demand for new housing as well as any potential restructuring of the GSEs remains unclear. Any limitations or restrictions on the availability of financing by these agencies could adversely affect interest rates, financing, and the Company’s sales of new homes. The Dodd-Frank Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) to regulate consumer financial products and services. Since 2014, the CFPB has promulgated rules concerning consumer credit transactions secured by a dwelling, which include real property mortgages and chattel loans (financed without land) secured by factory-built homes. The rules have caused some lenders to curtail underwriting such loans, and some investors are reluctant to own or participate in owning such loans because of the uncertainty of potential litigation and other costs. Consequently, such regulatory developments could cause some prospective buyers of factory-built homes to be unable to secure the financing necessary to complete purchases. In addition, compliance with the law and ongoing rule implementation has caused 34 lenders to incur additional costs to implement new processes, procedures, controls, and infrastructure required to comply with the regulations. Compliance may constrain lenders’ ability to profitably pric e certain loans. Failure to comply with these regulations, changes in these or other regulations, or the imposition of additional regulations, could affect the Company’s earnings, limit its access to capital, and have a material adverse effect on its busin ess and results of operations. The CFPB rules amending the Truth in Lending Act and Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act expand the types of mortgage loans that are subject to the protections of the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act (“HOEPA”), revise and expand the tests for coverage under HOEPA, and impose additional restrictions on mortgages that are covered by HOEPA. As a result, certain factory-built home loans are now subject to HOEPA limits on interest rates and fees. Loans with rates or fees in excess of the limits are deemed “high cost mortgages” and provide additional protections for borrowers, including with respect to determining the value of the home. Most loans for the purchase of factory-built homes have been written at rates and fees that would not appear to be considered high cost mortgages under the rule. Although some lenders may continue to offer loans that are now deemed high cost mortgages, the rate and fee limits appear to have deterred some lenders from offering loans to certain borrowers and may continue to make them reluctant to enter into loans subject to the provisions of HOEPA. As a result, some prospective buyers of factory-built homes may be unable to secure financing necessary to complete factory-built home purchases. The availability of wholesale financing for retailers is limited due to a limited number of floor plan lenders and reduced lending limits. Factory-built housing retailers generally finance their inventory purchases with wholesale floor plan financing provided by lending institutions. The availability of wholesale financing is significantly affected by the number of floor plan lenders and their lending limits. Limited availability of floor plan lending negatively affects the inventory levels of the Company’s independent retailers, the number of retail sales center locations and related wholesale demand, and adversely affects the availability of and access to capital on an ongoing basis. As a result, if the availability of wholesale financing is reduced, the Company could experience sales declines or a higher level of customer defaults and its operating results and cash flows could suffer. The Company has contingent repurchase obligations related to wholesale financing provided to industry retailers. As is customary in the factory-built housing industry, a significant portion of the Company’s manufacturing sales to independent retailers are financed under floor plan agreements with financing companies. In connection with the floor plan financing programs, the Company generally has separate agreements with the financing companies that require the Company to repurchase homes upon default by the retailer and repossession of the homes by the financing companies. These repurchase agreements are applicable for various periods of time, generally up to 24 months after the sale of the home to the retailer. However, certain homes are subject to repurchase until the home is sold by the retailer. The Company’s contingent repurchase obligation as of December 29, 2018, was estimated to be approximately $190.4 million, without reduction for the resale value of the homes. The Company may be required to honor contingent repurchase obligations in the future and may incur additional expense and reduced cash flows because of these repurchase agreements. If the Company is unable to establish or maintain relationships with independent distributors who sell its homes, the Company’s sales could decline and its operating results and cash flows could suffer. Although the Company maintains its own factory direct retail business in select markets, it conducts a majority of its business through independent distributors. For example, approximately 85% of the Company’s shipments of homes in fiscal 2018 were made to independent distributors throughout the United States and western Canada. The Company may not be able to establish relationships with new independent distributors or maintain good relationships with independent distributors that sell its homes. Even if the Company does establish and maintain relationships with independent distributors, these customers are not obligated to sell the Company’s homes exclusively and may choose to sell competitors’ homes instead. The independent distributors with whom the Company has relationships can cancel these relationships on short notice. In addition, these customers may not remain financially solvent, as they are subject to similar industry, economic, demographic and seasonal trends that the Company faces. If the Company does not establish and maintain relationships with solvent independent distributors in the markets it serves, sales in those markets could decline, and if the Company cannot effect offsetting expansion of its factory-direct retail business, the Company’s operating results and cash flows could suffer. Prices of certain materials can fluctuate and availability of certain materials may be limited at times. Prices of certain materials used in the construction of homes, such as lumber, insulation, steel, drywall, oil-based products and fuel, can fluctuate significantly due to changes in demand and supply. Additionally, availability of certain materials such as drywall and insulation may be 35 limited at times, resulting in higher prices or the need to find alternative suppliers. The Company may attempt to pass the higher mate rial costs on to customers, but it is not certain that it will be able to achieve this without affecting demand. Limited availability of materials may also adversely affect the Company’s production capabilities and results of operations. For some of the components used in production, the Company depends on a small group of suppliers and the loss of any of these suppliers could affect the Company’s ability to obtain components in a timely manner or at competitive prices, which would decrease its sales and profit margins. Some components are sourced from foreign sources and delays in obtaining these components could result in increased costs and decreased sales and profit margins. The Company depends on timely and sufficient delivery of components from its suppliers. Most components are readily available from a variety of sources. However, a few key components are currently produced by only a small group of quality suppliers that have the capacity to supply large quantities. If the Company cannot obtain an adequate supply of these key components its sales could decline and its operating results and cash flows could suffer. The Company’s results of operations can be adversely affected by labor shortages and turnover. The homebuilding industry has from time to time experienced labor shortages and other labor-related issues. A number of factors may adversely affect the labor force available to the Company and its subcontractors in one or more of its markets, including high employment levels, construction market conditions, and government regulation, which include laws and regulations related to workers’ health and safety, wage and hour practices, and immigration. The Company’s direct labor has historically experienced high turnover rates, which can lead to increased spending on training and retention and, as a result, increased costs of production. An overall labor shortage or a lack of skilled labor could cause significant increases in costs or delays in construction of homes, which could have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s net sales and results of operations. Industry conditions and future operating results could limit the Company’s sources of capital. If the Company is unable to locate suitable sources of capital when needed, it may be unable to maintain or expand its business. The Company depends on its cash balances, cash flows from operations, and its revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) to finance its operating requirements, capital expenditures, and other needs. If the Company’s cash balances, cash flows from operations, and availability under the Credit Facility are insufficient to finance its operations and alternative capital is not available, the Company may not be able to expand its business and make acquisitions, or it may need to curtail or limit its existing operations. Factory-built housing operates in the highly competitive housing industry, and, if other home builders are more successful or offer better value to the Company’s customers, the Company’s business could decline. The Company operates in a very competitive environment and faces competition from a number of other home builders in each market in which it operates. The Company competes with large national and regional home building companies and with smaller local home builders for financing, raw materials, and skilled management and labor resources. Some of the Company’s manufacturing competitors have captive retail distribution systems and consumer finance and insurance operations. In addition, there are independent factory-built housing retail locations that sell competitors’ products in most areas where the Company’s homes are sold and in most areas where it has retail operations. Because barriers to entry to the industry at both the manufacturing and retail levels are low, the Company believes that it is relatively easy for new competitors to enter its markets. In addition, the Company’s products compete within the housing industry more broadly with other forms of low to moderate-cost housing, including site-built homes, panelized homes, apartments, townhouses, condominiums, and repossessed homes. The Company also competes with resale homes, also referred to as “previously owned” or “existing” homes, as well as rental housing. An oversupply of homes available for sale or the heavy discounting of home prices by the Company’s competitors could adversely affect demand for the Company’s homes and the results of its operations. An increase in competitive conditions could have any of the following impacts on the Company: delivering fewer homes; sale of fewer homes or higher cancellations by the Company’s home buyers; an increase in selling incentives or reduction of prices; and realization of lower gross margins due to lower selling prices or an inability to increase selling prices to offset increased costs of the homes delivered. If the Company is unable to compete effectively in its markets, its business could decline disproportionately to that of its competitors. As a result, its sales could decline and its operating results and cash flows could suffer. 36 Changes in consumer preferences for the Company’s products or its failure to gauge those preferences could lead to reduced sales. The Company cannot be certain that historical consumer preferences for factory-built homes in general, and for its products in particular, will remain unchanged. The Company’s ability to remain competitive depends heavily on its ability to provide a continuing and timely introduction of innovative product offerings. The Company believes that the introduction of new features, designs, and models will be critical to the future success of its operations. Managing frequent product introductions poses inherent risks. Delays in the introduction or market acceptance of new models, designs, or product features could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business. Products may not be accepted for a number of reasons, including changes in consumer preferences or the Company’s failure to properly gauge consumer preferences. Further, the Company cannot be certain that new product introductions will not reduce net sales from existing models and adversely affect its results of operations. In addition, the Company’s net sales may be adversely affected if its new models and products are not introduced to the market on time or are not successful when introduced. Finally, the Company’s competitors’ new products may obtain better market acceptance. When the Company introduces new products into the marketplace, it may incur expenses that it did not anticipate, which, in turn, can result in reduced earnings. The introduction of new models, floor plans, and features are critical to the Company’s future success, however, the Company may incur unexpected expenses when it makes such introductions. For example, it may experience unexpected engineering or design flaws that may cause increased warranty costs. The costs resulting from these types of problems could be substantial and could have a significant adverse effect on the Company’s earnings. Estimated warranty costs are provided at the time of product sale to reflect the Company’s best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products. An increase in actual warranty claims costs as compared to the Company’s estimates could result in increased warranty reserves and expense which could have an adverse impact on the Company’s earnings. The Company’s products and services may experience quality problems from time to time that can result in decreased sales and gross margin and could harm the Company’s reputation. The Company’s products contain thousands of parts, many of which are supplied by a network of approved vendors. Product defects may occur, including components purchased from material vendors. The Company cannot assure that all such defects will be detected prior to the distribution of its products. In addition, although the Company endeavors to compel suppliers to maintain appropriate levels of insurance coverage, it cannot assure that if a defect in a vendor-supplied part were to occur that the vendor would have the ability to financially rectify the defect. Failure to detect defects in the Company’s products, including vendor-supplied parts, could result in lost revenue, increased warranty and related costs, and could harm the Company’s reputation. If the factory-built housing industry is not able to secure favorable local zoning ordinances, the Company’s sales could decline and its operating results and cash flows could suffer. Limitations on the number of sites available for placement of factory-built homes or on the operation of factory-built housing communities could reduce the demand for factory-built homes and, as a result, the Company’s sales. Factory-built housing communities and individual home placements are subject to local zoning ordinances and other local regulations relating to utility service and construction of roadways. In the past, some property owners have resisted the adoption of zoning ordinances permitting the use of factory-built homes in residential areas, which the Company believes has restricted the growth of the industry. Factory-built homes may not receive widespread acceptance and localities may not adopt zoning ordinances permitting the development of factory-built home communities. If the factory-built housing industry is unable to secure favorable local zoning ordinances, the Company’s sales could decline and its operating results and cash flows could suffer. The Company may not be able to manage its business effectively if it cannot retain current management team members or if it is unable to attract and motivate key personnel. Our success depends on upon the skills, experience, and active participation of our senior management and key employees, including at our Titan Factory Direct and Star Fleet Trucking operations, many of whom have been with the Company for a significant number of years. Transitions in the Company’s senior management team or other key employees may result in operational disruptions, and the Company’s business may be harmed as a result, in particular if we were unable to find appropriate replacements on a timely basis. The Company may not be able to attract or motivate qualified management and operations personnel in the future. If the Company is not able to attract and motivate necessary personnel to accomplish its business objectives, it will experience constraints that will significantly impede the achievement of its 37 objectives. The Company may also have difficulty attracting exp erienced personnel and may be required to expend significant financial resources in its employee recruitment efforts . Product liability claims and litigation and warranty claims that arise in the ordinary course of business may be costly, which could adversely affect the Company’s business. As a home builder, the Company is subject to construction defect and home warranty claims arising in the ordinary course of business. These claims are common in the home building industry and can be costly. In addition, the costs of insuring against construction defect and product liability claims are high. There can be no assurance that this coverage will not be restricted and become more costly. If the limits or coverages of the Company’s current and former insurance programs prove inadequate, or the Company is not able to obtain adequate, or reasonably priced insurance against these types of claims in the future, or the amounts currently provided for future warranty or insurance claims are inadequate, the Company may experience losses that could negatively impact its financial results. The Company records expenses and liabilities based on the estimated costs required to cover its self-insured liability under its insurance policies, and estimated costs of potential claims and claim adjustment expenses that are above its coverage limits or that are not covered by its insurance policies. These estimated costs are based on an analysis of the Company’s historical claims and industry data, and include an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. Due to the degree of judgment required and the potential for variability in the underlying assumptions when deriving estimated liabilities, the Company’s actual future costs could differ from those estimated, and the difference could be material to its consolidated financial statements. Security breaches and other disruptions could compromise the Company’s information and expose it to liability, which would cause its business and reputation to suffer. In the ordinary course of the Company’s business, it collects and stores sensitive data, including intellectual property, its proprietary business information and that of its suppliers and business partners, as well as personally identifiable information of its customers and employees. The Company also has outsourced elements of its information technology structure, and as a result, it is managing independent vendor relationships with third parties who may or could have access to the Company’s confidential information. Similarly, the Company’s business partners and other third party providers possess certain of its sensitive data. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to the Company’s operations and business strategy. Despite its security measures, the Company’s information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance, or other disruptions. The Company, its partners, vendors, and other third party providers could be susceptible to third party attacks on the Company’s, and their, information security systems, which attacks are of ever-increasing levels of sophistication and are made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise, including criminal groups. Any such breach could compromise the Company’s networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost, or stolen. Any such access, disclosure, or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, disrupt the Company’s operations, and damage its reputation, any of which could adversely affect the Company’s business. The Company is subject to extensive regulation affecting the production and sale of factory-built housing, which could adversely affect its profitability. The Company is subject to a variety of federal, state, and local laws and regulations affecting the production and sale of factory-built housing. The Company’s failure to comply with such laws and regulations could expose it to a wide variety of sanctions, including closing one or more manufacturing facilities. Regulatory matters affecting the Company’s operations are under regular review by governmental bodies and the Company cannot predict what effect, if any, new laws and regulations would have on it or the factory-built housing industry. Failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or the passage in the future of new and more stringent laws, may adversely affect the Company’s financial condition or results of operations. The cost of operations could be adversely impacted by increased costs of healthcare benefits provided to employees. In 2010, the Affordable Care Act, was passed into law. As enacted, the health reform law changes, among other things, certain aspects of health insurance. The Affordable Care Act, coupled with the uncertainty in the insurance markets associated with the future of the Act, could increase the Company’s healthcare costs, which could adversely impact the Company’s earnings. 38 A prolonged delay by Congress and the President to approve budgets or continuing appropriation resolutions to facilitate the operations of the federal government could delay the completion of home sales or caus e cancellations, and thereby negatively impact the Company’s deliveries and revenues. Congress and the President may not timely approve budgets or appropriation legislation to facilitate the operations of the federal government, as was the case with the recent government shut-down that ended January 25, 2019. As a result, many federal agencies have historically and may again cease or curtail some activities. The affected activities include Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) verification of loan applicants’ tax return information, the funding of orders by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (“FEMA”) as part of FEMA’s disaster relief efforts, and approvals by the FHA and other government agencies to fund or insure mortgage loans under programs that these agencies operate. As many of the Company’s home buyers use these programs to obtain financing to purchase its homes, and many lenders require ongoing coordination with these and other governmental entities to originate home loans, a prolonged delay in the performance of their activities could prevent prospective qualified buyers of its homes from obtaining the loans they need to complete such purchases, which could lead to delays or cancellations of home sales. These and other affected governmental bodies could cause interruptions in various aspects of the Company’s business and investments. Depending on the length of disruption, such factors could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition. Increases in the after-tax costs of owning a factory-built home could prevent potential customers from buying the Company’s products and adversely affect its business or financial results. Significant expenses of owning a factory-built home, including mortgage interest expenses and real estate taxes, generally were, under prior tax law, deductible expenses for an individual’s federal, and in some cases state, income taxes, subject to certain limitations. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, signed into law in December 2017, includes provisions that would impose limitations with respect to these income tax deductions. Increases in property tax rates or fees on developers by local governmental authorities, as experienced in response to reduced federal and state funding or to fund local initiatives, such as funding schools or road improvements, or increases in insurance premiums can adversely affect the ability of potential customers to obtain financing or their desire to purchase new homes, and can have an adverse impact on the Company’s business and financial results. The transportation industry is subject to government regulation, and regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operating results or financial condition. The Company’s Star Fleet Trucking subsidiary provides transportation services. The transportation industry is subject to legislative or regulatory changes, including potential limits on carbon emissions under climate change legislation and Department of Transportation regulations regarding, among other things, driver breaks, classification of independent drivers, “restart” rules, and the use of electronic logging devices that can affect the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or influencing the demand for, and cost of providing, transportation services. The Company may become subject to new or more restrictive regulations relating to fuel emissions or limits on vehicle weight and size. Future laws and regulations may be more stringent and require changes in operating practices, influence the demand for transportation services or increase the cost of providing transportation services, any of which could adversely affect the Company’s business and results of operations. Natural disasters and severe weather conditions could delay deliveries, increase costs, and decrease demand for new factory-built homes in affected areas. The Company’s operations are located in many areas that are subject to natural disasters and severe weather. The occurrence of natural disasters or severe weather conditions can delay factory-built home deliveries, increase costs by damaging inventories, reduce the availability of materials, and negatively impact the demand for new factory-built homes in affected areas. Furthermore, if the Company’s insurance does not fully cover business interruptions or losses resulting from these events, the Company’s earnings, liquidity, or capital resources could be adversely affected. Changes in foreign exchange rates could adversely affect the value of the Company’s investments in Canada and cause foreign exchange losses related to intercompany loans. The Company has substantial investments in businesses in Canada. Unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates could adversely affect the value of the Company’s investments in these businesses. 39 Certain of the Company’s shareholders beneficially own a substantial amount of the Company’s common stock and have substantial control over the Company and their interests may conflict with or differ from your interest s as a shareholder. Affiliates of Bain Capital Credit, L.P., Centerbridge Partners, L.P. and MAK Capital (collectively, the “Principal Shareholders”) each beneficially owned more than 8.0% of the Company’s shares of common stock as of December 29, 2018 and three directors of the Company were designated by the Principal Shareholders pursuant to the investor rights agreement between the Company and the Principal Shareholders. Although we are no longer a “controlled company” under the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) rules, the Principal Shareholders are still able to exert a significant degree of influence over the Company’s management and affairs and over matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election of directors, a merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and other significant business or corporate transactions. The Principal Shareholders may have interests that are different from other shareholders and may vote in a way that is adverse to the interests of other shareholders. In addition, this concentration of ownership could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control or otherwise discouraging a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of the Company, which could cause the market price of the Company’s common stock to decline or prevent our shareholders from realizing a premium over the market price for their shares. Additionally, each of the Principal Shareholders is in the business of making investments in companies and may acquire and hold, and in a few instances have acquired and held, interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with the Company. One or more of the Principal Shareholders may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to the Company’s business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to the Company. Following completion of the secondary offering of our common stock on September 25, 2018, the Company is no longer a “controlled company” under NYSE rules. However, the Company will continue to qualify for, and may rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements that would otherwise provide protection to our shareholders during a one-year transition period. Following the completion of the secondary offering of our common stock on September 25, 2018, the Principal Shareholders ceased to control a majority of the voting power of our common stock. As a result, the Company is no longer a “controlled company” within the meaning of the NYSE corporate governance standards. Consequently, the NYSE rules will require that the Company (i) have a majority of independent directors on its board of directors within one year after the date the Company no longer qualified as a “controlled company”; (ii) have compensation and nominating and governance committees composed entirely of independent directors within one year of such date; and (iii) perform an annual performance evaluation of the compensation and nominating and governance committees. During this transition period, we will continue to qualify for and may continue to utilize the available exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements as permitted by NYSE rules. Accordingly, during the transition period, you may not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to all of the NYSE corporate governance requirements, which could make our common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price. Anti-takeover provisions in the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-Laws could prohibit a change of control that the Company’s shareholders may favor and could negatively affect the Company’s stock price. In addition to the Principal Shareholders’ beneficial ownership of a substantial percentage of the Company’s common stock, the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-Laws contain provisions that could make it more difficult and expensive for a third party to acquire control of the Company, even if a change of control would be beneficial to the interests of the Company’s shareholders. These provisions could discourage potential takeover attempts and could adversely affect the market price of the Company’s common stock. These provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by the Company’s shareholders to replace or remove the Company’s management. For example, the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-Laws: • permit the Board of Directors to issue preferred stock with such terms as they determine, without shareholder approval; • require advance notice for shareholder proposals and director nominations; and • contain limitations on convening shareholder meetings and shareholder action by written consent. 40 These provisions make it more difficult for shareholders or potential acquirers to acquire the Company without negotiation and could discourage potential tak eover attempts and could adversely affect the market price of the Company’s common stock. The integration of Skyline and Champion Holdings may not be successful or the anticipated benefits from their combination may not be realized in their entirety. After the consummation of the Exchange contemplated by the Exchange Agreement, the Company’s management must integrate the operations, as well as financial and other systems of Skyline and Champion Holdings. The Company’s management will be required to devote a great deal of time and attention to the process of integrating the operations while carrying on the ongoing operations. A significant degree of difficulty and management involvement is inherent in the integration process. The integration process includes but is not limited to: • integrating the operations while carrying on the ongoing business; • creating uniform policies, procedures, standards, internal controls, and information systems and controlling the costs associated with such matters; • integrating information technology, purchasing, accounting, sales, payroll and regulatory compliance systems; • the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding the integration process; and • integrating two business cultures, which may prove to be incompatible. There is no assurance that the Company will be successful or cost effective at integrating the two companies. The integration may cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in the activities of the business after the consummation of the Exchange. If the Company’s management is unable to manage the integration process effectively, or any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process, the Company’s business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted. Even if the Company is able to combine the two business operations successfully, it may not be possible to realize the full benefits of the expected synergies, which are expected to result from the Exchange, or realize these benefits within the time frame that is expected. For example, the benefits from the Exchange may be offset by costs incurred or delays in integrating the companies. If the Company fails to realize the benefits it anticipates from the Exchange, the business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. The Company incurs substantial costs as a result of operating as a public company, and the Company’s management is required to devote substantial time to compliance initiatives. As a public company, the Company currently incurs substantial legal, accounting, and other expenses. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules subsequently implemented by the SEC, impose various requirements on public companies, including requiring the establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices. The Company’s management devotes both time and financial resources to these compliance initiatives. If the Company fails to staff its accounting and finance functions adequately, or fails to maintain internal controls adequate to meet the demands that are placed upon it as a public company, including the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we may be unable to report our financial results accurately or in a timely manner and our business and stock price may suffer. The costs of being a public company, as well as diversion of management’s time and attention, may have an adverse effect on the Company’s future business. The Company’s failure to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could harm its business and financial results. The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that the Company would prevent or detect a misstatement of its financial statements or fraud. Skyline identified a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2017 as it relates to the accuracy and valuation of its inventory. Under standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, a material weakness is a deficiency, 41 or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The Comp any has initiated remediation measures and these activities may divert management’s attention from other business concerns, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. If we are un able to successfully remediate this material weakness and if we are unable to produce accurate and timely financial statements, our stock price may be adversely affected and we may be unable to maintain compliance with applicable stock exchange listing req uirements. The Company does not anticipate paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. The Company currently intends to retain our future earnings, if any, for the foreseeable future, to fund the development and growth of the Company’s business. As a result, capital appreciation in the price of the Company’s common stock, if any, will be investors’ only source of gain on an investment in the Company’s common stock. Any future determination to pay dividends to shareholders will be at the sole discretion of the Company’s board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including general economic conditions, the Company’s financial condition and results of operations, the Company’s available cash and current and anticipated cash needs, capital requirements, contractual, legal, tax and regulatory restrictions, the implications of the payment of dividends by the Company to its shareholders or by the Company’s subsidiaries to the Company and any other factors that the board of directors may deem relevant. 42 Item 6.

Apple Inc. | Q3 2023 Form 10-Q | 5 Apple Inc. Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation and Preparation The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively “Apple” or the “Company”). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. In the opinion of the Company’s management, the condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation. These condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the Company’s annual consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022. The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first fiscal quarter of 2023. The Company’s fiscal years 2023 and 2022 span 53 and 52 weeks, respectively. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Earnings Per Share The following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the three- and nine-month periods ended July 1, 2023 and June 25, 2022 (net income in millions and shares in thousands): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended July 1, 2023 June 25, 2022 July 1, 2023 June 25, 2022 Numerator: Net income $ 19,881 $ 19,442 $ 74,039 $ 79,082 Denominator: Weighted-average basic shares outstanding 15,697,614 16,162,945 15,792,497 16,277,824 Effect of dilutive securities 77,407 99,258 66,766 117,113 Weighted-average diluted shares 15,775,021 16,262,203 15,859,263 16,394,937 Basic earnings per share $ 1.27 $ 1.20 $ 4.69 $ 4.86 Diluted earnings per share $ 1.26 $ 1.20 $ 4.67 $ 4.82 Approximately 32 million restricted stock units (“RSUs”) were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for the nine months ended July 1, 2023 because their effect would have been antidilutive. Apple Inc. | Q3 2023 Form 10-Q | 6 Note 2 – Revenue Net sales disaggregated by significant products and services for the three- and nine-month periods ended July 1, 2023 and June 25, 2022 were as follows (in millions): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended July 1, 2023 June 25, 2022 July 1, 2023 June 25, 2022 iPhone ® $ 39,669 $ 40,665 $ 156,778 $ 162,863 Mac ® 6,840 7,382 21,743 28,669 iPad ® 5,791 7,224 21,857 22,118 Wearables, Home and Accessories 8,284 8,084 30,523 31,591 Services 21,213 19,604 62,886 58,941 Total net sales $ 81,797 $ 82,959 $ 293,787 $ 304,182 Total net sales include $ 3.3 billion of revenue recognized in the three months ended July 1, 2023 that was included in deferred revenue as of April 1, 2023, $ 3.1 billion of revenue recognized in the three months ended June 25, 2022 that was included in deferred revenue as of March 26, 2022, $ 7.0 billion of revenue recognized in the nine months ended July 1, 2023 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 24, 2022, and $ 6.3 billion of revenue recognized in the nine months ended June 25, 2022 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 25, 2021. The Company’s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable segment in Note 10, “Segment Information and Geographic Data” for the three- and nine-month periods ended July 1, 2023 and June 25, 2022, except in Greater China, where iPhone revenue represented a moderately higher proportion of net sales. As of July 1, 2023 and September 24, 2022, the Company had total deferred revenue of $ 12.2 billion and $ 12.4 billion, respectively. As of July 1, 2023, the Company expects 67 % of total deferred revenue to be realized in less than a year, 26 % within one-to-two years, 6 % within two-to-three years and 1 % in greater than three years.

(2) Level 2 fair value estimates are based on observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. (3) As of July 1, 2023 and September 24, 2022, total marketable securities included $ 14.1 billion and $ 12.7 billion, respectively, that were restricted from general use, related to the State Aid Decision (refer to Note 5, “Income Taxes”) and other agreements. The following table shows the fair value of the Company’s non-current marketable debt securities, by contractual maturity, as of July 1, 2023 (in millions): Due after 1 year through 5 years $ 76,267 Due after 5 years through 10 years 11,148 Due after 10 years 16,646 Total fair value $ 104,061 Derivative Instruments and Hedging The Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates. Foreign Exchange Risk To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, option contracts or other instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months. To protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of July 1, 2023, the maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term debt–related foreign currency transactions is 19 years. Apple Inc. | Q3 2023 Form 10-Q | 8 The Company may also enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. Interest Rate Risk To protect the Company’s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. The notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments as of July 1, 2023 and September 24, 2022 were as follows (in millions): July 1, 2023 September 24, 2022 Derivative instruments designated as accounting hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ 45,425 $ 102,670 Interest rate contracts $ 19,375 $ 20,125 Derivative instruments not designated as accounting hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ 90,977 $ 185,381 The gross fair values of the Company’s derivative assets and liabilities as of September 24, 2022 were as follows (in millions): September 24, 2022 Fair Value of Derivatives Designated as Accounting Hedges Fair Value of Derivatives Not Designated as Accounting Hedges Total Fair Value Derivative assets (1) : Foreign exchange contracts $ 4,317 $ 2,819 $ 7,136 Derivative liabilities (2) : Foreign exchange contracts $ 2,205 $ 2,547 $ 4,752 Interest rate contracts $ 1,367 $ — $ 1,367 (1) Derivative assets are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current assets and other non-current assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. (2) Derivative liabilities are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. The derivative assets above represent the Company’s gross credit exposure if all counterparties failed to perform. To mitigate credit risk, the Company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair values of certain derivatives fluctuate from contractually established thresholds. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to the Company’s derivative contracts, under which the Company is allowed to settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of September 24, 2022, the potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the Company’s derivative contracts, including the effects of collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $ 7.8 billion, resulting in a net derivative asset of $ 412 million. The carrying amounts of the Company’s hedged items in fair value hedges as of July 1, 2023 and September 24, 2022 were as follows (in millions): July 1, 2023 September 24, 2022 Hedged assets/(liabilities): Current and non-current marketable securities $ 14,863 $ 13,378 Current and non-current term debt $ ( 17,986 ) $ ( 18,739 ) Apple Inc. | Q3 2023 Form 10-Q | 9 Accounts Receivable Trade Receivables The Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, resellers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral or third-party credit support in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements. As of September 24, 2022, the Company had one customer that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, which accounted for 10 % . The Company’s cellular network carriers accounted for 44 % of total trade receivables as of September 24, 2022. Vendor Non-Trade Receivables The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. As of July 1, 2023, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 54 % and 14 % . As of September 24, 2022, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 54 % and 13 %. Note 4 – Condensed Consolidated Financial Statement Details The following tables show the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statement details as of July 1, 2023 and September 24, 2022 (in millions): Inventories July 1, 2023 September 24, 2022 Components $ 3,788 $ 1,637 Finished goods 3,563 3,309 Total inventories $ 7,351 $ 4,946 Property, Plant and Equipment, Net July 1, 2023 September 24, 2022 Gross property, plant and equipment $ 114,337 $ 114,457 Accumulated depreciation and amortization ( 70,787 ) ( 72,340 ) Total property, plant and equipment, net $ 43,550 $ 42,117 Other Income/(Expense), Net The following table shows the detail of other income/(expense), net for the three- and nine-month periods ended July 1, 2023 and June 25, 2022 (in millions): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended July 1, 2023 June 25, 2022 July 1, 2023 June 25, 2022 Interest and dividend income $ 980 $ 722 $ 2,766 $ 2,072 Interest expense ( 998 ) ( 719 ) ( 2,931 ) ( 2,104 ) Other expense, net ( 247 ) ( 13 ) ( 429 ) ( 65 ) Total other income/(expense), net $ ( 265 ) $ ( 10 ) $ ( 594 ) $ ( 97 ) Apple Inc. | Q3 2023 Form 10-Q | 10 Note 5 – Income Taxes European Commission State Aid Decision On August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company (the “State Aid Decision”). The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The Company and Ireland appealed the State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the “General Court”). On July 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September 25, 2020, the European Commission appealed the General Court’s decision to the European Court of Justice (the “ECJ”) and a hearing was held on May 23, 2023. A decision from the ECJ is expected in calendar year 2024. The Company believes it would be eligible to claim a U.S. foreign tax credit for a portion of any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision. Note 6 – Debt Commercial Paper The Company issues unsecured short-term promissory notes (“Commercial Paper”) pursuant to a commercial paper program. The Company uses net proceeds from the commercial paper program for general corporate purposes, including dividends and share repurchases. As of July 1, 2023 and September 24, 2022, the Company had $ 4.0 billion and $ 10.0 billion of Commercial Paper outstanding, respectively.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This section and other parts of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“Form 10-Q”) contain forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example, statements in this Form 10-Q regarding the potential future impact of macroeconomic conditions on the Company’s business and results of operations are forward-looking statements . Forward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as “future,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “predicts,” “will,” “would,” “could,” “can,” “may,” and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company’s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022 (the “2022 Form 10-K”) under the heading “Risk Factors.” The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law. Unless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Company’s fiscal calendar, and references to particular years, quarters, months or periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Each of the terms the “Company” and “Apple” as used herein refers collectively to Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, unless otherwise stated. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the 2022 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. Available Information The Company periodically provides certain information for investors on its corporate website, www.apple.com, and its investor relations website, investor.apple.com. This includes press releases and other information about financial performance, information on environmental, social and governance matters, and details related to the Company’s annual meeting of shareholders. The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form 10-Q is not incorporated by reference into this filing. Further, the Company’s references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only. Business Seasonality and Product Introductions The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction. Fiscal Period The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company’s fiscal years 2023 and 2022 span 53 and 52 weeks, respectively. Quarterly Highlights Weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable impact on the Company’s total net sales, which decreased 1% or $1.2 billion during the third quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022. The year-over-year net sales decrease consisted primarily of lower net sales of iPad and iPhone, partially offset by higher net sales of Services. During the third quarter of 2023, the Company announced the following new products: • 15-inch MacBook Air ® , powered by the M2 chip; • Mac Studio™, powered by the M2 Max chip and the new M2 Ultra chip; • Mac Pro ® , powered by the new M2 Ultra chip; and • Apple Vision Pro™, the Company’s first spatial computer featuring its new visionOS™, expected to be available in early calendar year 2024.

Products gross margin percentage increased during the third quarter of 2023 compared to the third quarter of 2022 due primarily to cost savings and a different Products mix, partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and decreased leverage. Year-over-year Products gross margin percentage decreased during the first nine months of 2023 due primarily to the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and decreased leverage, partially offset by cost savings and a different Products mix. Services Gross Margin Services gross margin increased during the third quarter and first nine months of 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022 due primarily to higher Services net sales, partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and higher Services costs. Services gross margin percentage decreased during the third quarter of 2023 compared to the third quarter of 2022 due primarily to higher Services costs, partially offset by improved leverage.

The Company’s future gross margins can be impacted by a variety of factors, as discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the 2022 Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.” As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and downward pressure. Apple Inc. | Q3 2023 Form 10-Q | 17 Operating Expenses Operating expenses for the three- and nine-month periods ended July 1, 2023 and June 25, 2022 were as follows (dollars in millions): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended July 1, 2023 June 25, 2022 July 1, 2023 June 25, 2022 Research and development $ 7,442 $ 6,797 $ 22,608 $ 19,490 Percentage of total net sales 9 % 8 % 8 % 6 % Selling, general and administrative $ 5,973 $ 6,012 $ 18,781 $ 18,654 Percentage of total net sales 7 % 7 % 6 % 6 % Total operating expenses $ 13,415 $ 12,809 $ 41,389 $ 38,144 Percentage of total net sales 16 % 15 % 14 % 13 % Research and Development The growth in research and development (“R&D”) expense during the third quarter and first nine months of 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses.

Apple Inc. | Q3 2023 Form 10-Q | 18 Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond. The Company’s contractual cash requirements have not changed materially since the 2022 Form 10-K, except for manufacturing purchase obligations. Manufacturing Purchase Obligations The Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company’s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. As of July 1, 2023, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $38.4 billion, with $38.1 billion payable within 12 months. The Company’s manufacturing purchase obligations are primarily noncancelable. Capital Return Program In addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company had authorized share repurchase programs as of July 1, 2023. The programs do not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of July 1, 2023, the Company’s quarterly cash dividend was $0.24 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to condensed consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of the 2022 Form 10-K describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements. There have been no material changes to the Company’s critical accounting estimates since the 2022 Form 10-K. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk There have been no material changes to the Company’s market risk during the first nine months of 2023.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) were effective as of July 1, 2023 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the third quarter of 2023, which were identified in connection with management’s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Apple Inc. | Q3 2023 Form 10-Q | 19 PART II — OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings Epic Games Epic Games, Inc. (“Epic”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the “District Court”) against the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California’s unfair competition law based upon the Company’s operation of its App Store. On September 10, 2021, the District Court ruled in favor of the Company with respect to nine out of the ten counts included in Epic’s claim. The District Court found that certain provisions of the Company’s App Store Review Guidelines violate California’s unfair competition law and issued an injunction enjoining the Company from prohibiting developers from including in their apps external links that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than Apple in-app purchasing. The injunction applies to apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store. On April 24, 2023, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (the “Circuit Court”) affirmed the District Court’s ruling. On June 7, 2023, the Company and Epic filed petitions with the Circuit Court requesting further review of the decision. On June 30, 2023, the Circuit Court denied both petitions. On July 17, 2023, the Circuit Court granted Apple’s motion to stay enforcement of the injunction pending appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. Epic has appealed the Circuit Court’s stay of the injunction. If the U.S. Supreme Court reverses the Circuit Court’s stay of the injunction or declines Apple’s petition, the injunction will take effect. Other Legal Proceedings The Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the third quarter of 2023 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Item 1A. Risk Factors The Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described in Part I, Item 1A of the 2022 Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.” When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely affected. There have been no material changes to the Company’s risk factors since the 2022 Form 10-K. Apple Inc. | Q3 2023 Form 10-Q | 20 Item 2.

Apple Inc. | Q2 2023 Form 10-Q | 5 Apple Inc. Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation and Preparation The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively “Apple” or the “Company”). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. In the opinion of the Company’s management, the condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation. These condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the Company’s annual consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022. The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first fiscal quarter of 2023. The Company’s fiscal years 2023 and 2022 span 53 and 52 weeks, respectively. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.

The following table shows the fair value of the Company’s non-current marketable debt securities, by contractual maturity, as of April 1, 2023 (in millions): Due after 1 year through 5 years $ 81,352 Due after 5 years through 10 years 11,928 Due after 10 years 17,181 Total fair value $ 110,461 Derivative Instruments and Hedging The Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates. Foreign Exchange Risk To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, option contracts or other instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months. To protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of April 1, 2023, the maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term debt–related foreign currency transactions is 19 years. Apple Inc. | Q2 2023 Form 10-Q | 8 The Company may also enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. Interest Rate Risk To protect the Company’s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. The notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments as of April 1, 2023 and September 24, 2022 were as follows (in millions): April 1, 2023 September 24, 2022 Derivative instruments designated as accounting hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ 51,119 $ 102,670 Interest rate contracts $ 19,375 $ 20,125 Derivative instruments not designated as accounting hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ 111,696 $ 185,381 The gross fair values of the Company’s derivative assets and liabilities as of September 24, 2022 were as follows (in millions): September 24, 2022 Fair Value of Derivatives Designated as Accounting Hedges Fair Value of Derivatives Not Designated as Accounting Hedges Total Fair Value Derivative assets (1) : Foreign exchange contracts $ 4,317 $ 2,819 $ 7,136 Derivative liabilities (2) : Foreign exchange contracts $ 2,205 $ 2,547 $ 4,752 Interest rate contracts $ 1,367 $ — $ 1,367 (1) Derivative assets are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current assets and other non-current assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. (2) Derivative liabilities are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. The derivative assets above represent the Company’s gross credit exposure if all counterparties failed to perform. To mitigate credit risk, the Company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair values of certain derivatives fluctuate from contractually established thresholds. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to the Company’s derivative contracts, under which the Company is allowed to settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of September 24, 2022, the potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the Company’s derivative contracts, including the effects of collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $ 7.8 billion, resulting in a net derivative asset of $ 412 million. The carrying amounts of the Company’s hedged items in fair value hedges as of April 1, 2023 and September 24, 2022 were as follows (in millions): April 1, 2023 September 24, 2022 Hedged assets/(liabilities): Current and non-current marketable securities $ 14,651 $ 13,378 Current and non-current term debt $ ( 18,249 ) $ ( 18,739 ) Apple Inc. | Q2 2023 Form 10-Q | 9 Accounts Receivable Trade Receivables The Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, resellers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral or third-party credit support in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements. As of both April 1, 2023 and September 24, 2022, the Company had one customer that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, which accounted for 10 % . The Company’s cellular network carriers accounted for 32 % and 44 % of total trade receivables as of April 1, 2023 and September 24, 2022, respectively. Vendor Non-Trade Receivables The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. As of April 1, 2023, the Company had three vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 43 %, 19 % and 13 %. As of September 24, 2022, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 54 % and 13 %.

The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The Company and Ireland appealed the State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the “General Court”). On July 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September 25, 2020, the European Commission appealed the General Court’s decision to the European Court of Justice and a hearing has been scheduled for May 23, 2023. The Company believes it would be eligible to claim a U.S. foreign tax credit for a portion of any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision. Note 6 – Debt Commercial Paper The Company issues unsecured short-term promissory notes (“Commercial Paper”) pursuant to a commercial paper program.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This section and other parts of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“Form 10-Q”) contain forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example, statements in this Form 10-Q regarding the potential future impact of macroeconomic conditions on the Company’s business and results of operations are forward-looking statements . Forward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as “future,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “predicts,” “will,” “would,” “could,” “can,” “may,” and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company’s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022 (the “2022 Form 10-K”) under the heading “Risk Factors.” The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law. Unless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Company’s fiscal calendar, and references to particular years, quarters, months or periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Each of the terms the “Company” and “Apple” as used herein refers collectively to Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, unless otherwise stated. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the 2022 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. Available Information The Company periodically provides certain information for investors on its corporate website, www.apple.com, and its investor relations website, investor.apple.com. This includes press releases and other information about financial performance, information on environmental, social and governance matters, and details related to the Company’s annual meeting of shareholders. The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form 10-Q is not incorporated by reference into this filing. Further, the Company’s references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only. Business Seasonality and Product Introductions The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction. Fiscal Period The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company’s fiscal years 2023 and 2022 span 53 and 52 weeks, respectively. Quarterly Highlights Weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable impact on the Company’s total net sales, which decreased 3% or $2.4 billion during the second quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022. The year-over-year net sales decrease consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac, partially offset by higher net sales of Services. During the second quarter of 2023, the Company announced the following new products: • MacBook Pro ® 14” and MacBook Pro 16”, powered by the Apple M2 Pro and M2 Max chip; • Mac mini ® , powered by the Apple M2 and M2 Pro chip; and • Second-generation HomePod ® . The Company repurchased $19.1 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $3.7 billion during the second quarter of 2023. Apple Inc. | Q2 2023 Form 10-Q | 14 Macroeconomic Conditions Macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, changes in interest rates, and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly impacted, and could in the future materially impact, the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.

Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for the three- and six-month periods ended April 1, 2023 and March 26, 2022 were as follows (dollars in millions): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended April 1, 2023 March 26, 2022 April 1, 2023 March 26, 2022 Provision for income taxes $ 4,222 $ 5,129 $ 9,847 $ 11,740 Effective tax rate 14.9 % 17.0 % 15.4 % 16.4 % Statutory federal income tax rate 21 % 21 % 21 % 21 % The Company’s effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2023 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings and the U.S. federal R&D credit, partially offset by state income taxes. The Company’s effective tax rate for the first six months of 2023 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, the U.S. federal R&D credit and tax benefits from share-based compensation, partially offset by state income taxes. The Company’s effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2023 was lower compared to the second quarter of 2022 due primarily to the impact of U.S. foreign tax credit regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2022 and a higher U.S. federal R&D credit. The Company’s effective tax rate for the first six months of 2023 was lower compared to the same period in 2022 due primarily to the impact of U.S. foreign tax credit regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2022 and a higher U.S. federal R&D credit, partially offset by lower tax benefits from share-based compensation. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond. The Company’s contractual cash requirements have not changed materially since the 2022 Form 10-K, except for commercial paper and manufacturing purchase obligations. Apple Inc. | Q2 2023 Form 10-Q | 18 Commercial Paper The Company issues unsecured short-term promissory notes (“Commercial Paper”) pursuant to a commercial paper program. As of April 1, 2023, the Company had $2.0 billion of Commercial Paper outstanding, all of which was payable within 12 months. Manufacturing Purchase Obligations The Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company’s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. As of April 1, 2023, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $40.5 billion, with $40.1 billion payable within 12 months. The Company’s manufacturing purchase obligations are primarily noncancelable. Capital Return Program In addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has an authorized share repurchase program, under which the remaining availability was $22.6 billion as of April 1, 2023. On May 4, 2023, the Company announced the Board of Directors had authorized an additional program to repurchase up to $90 billion of the Company’s common stock. The programs do not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. On May 4, 2023, the Company also announced the Board of Directors raised the Company’s quarterly cash dividend from $0.23 to $0.24 per share, beginning with the dividend to be paid during the third quarter of 2023. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to condensed consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of the 2022 Form 10-K describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements. There have been no material changes to the Company’s critical accounting estimates since the 2022 Form 10-K. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk There have been no material changes to the Company’s market risk during the first six months of 2023. For a discussion of the Company’s exposure to market risk, refer to the Company’s market risk disclosures set forth in Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” of the 2022 Form 10-K. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) were effective as of April 1, 2023 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the second quarter of 2023, which were identified in connection with management’s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Apple Inc. | Q2 2023 Form 10-Q | 19 PART II — OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings Epic Games Epic Games, Inc. (“Epic”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the “Northern California District Court”) against the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California’s unfair competition law based upon the Company’s operation of its App Store ® . The Company filed a counterclaim for breach of contract. On September 10, 2021, the Northern California District Court ruled in favor of the Company with respect to nine out of the ten counts included in Epic’s claim, and in favor of the Company with respect to the Company’s claims for breach of contract. The Northern California District Court found that certain provisions of the Company’s App Store Review Guidelines violate California’s unfair competition law and issued an injunction. On April 24, 2023, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the Northern California District Court’s ruling. The Company is considering further review of the decision. Other Legal Proceedings The Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the second quarter of 2023 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Item 1A. Risk Factors The Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described in Part I, Item 1A of the 2022 Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.” When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely affected. There have been no material changes to the Company’s risk factors since the 2022 Form 10-K. Item 2.

Apple Inc. | Q1 2023 Form 10-Q | 5 Apple Inc. Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation and Preparation The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively “Apple” or the “Company”). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. In the opinion of the Company’s management, the condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation. These condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the Company’s annual consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022. The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first fiscal quarter of 2023. The Company’s fiscal years 2023 and 2022 span 53 and 52 weeks, respectively. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Earnings Per Share The following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021 (net income in millions and shares in thousands): Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 Numerator: Net income $ 29,998 $ 34,630 Denominator: Weighted-average basic shares outstanding 15,892,723 16,391,724 Effect of dilutive securities 62,995 127,567 Weighted-average diluted shares 15,955,718 16,519,291 Basic earnings per share $ 1.89 $ 2.11 Diluted earnings per share $ 1.88 $ 2.10 Approximately 89 million restricted stock units (“RSUs”) were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for the three months ended December 31, 2022 because their effect would have been antidilutive. Apple Inc. | Q1 2023 Form 10-Q | 6 Note 2 – Revenue Net sales disaggregated by significant products and services for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021 were as follows (in millions): Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 iPhone ® (1) $ 65,775 $ 71,628 Mac ® (1) 7,735 10,852 iPad ® (1) 9,396 7,248 Wearables, Home and Accessories (1)(2) 13,482 14,701 Services (3) 20,766 19,516 Total net sales (4) $ 117,154 $ 123,945 (1) Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are bundled in the sales price of the respective product. (2) Wearables, Home and Accessories net sales include sales of AirPods ® , Apple TV ® , Apple Watch ® , Beats ® products, HomePod mini ® and accessories. (3) Services net sales include sales from the Company’s advertising, AppleCare ® , cloud, digital content, payment and other services. Services net sales also include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain products. (4) Includes $ 3.4 billion of revenue recognized in the three months ended December 31, 2022 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 24, 2022 and $ 3.0 billion of revenue recognized in the three months ended December 25, 2021 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 25, 2021. The Company’s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable segment in Note 9, “Segment Information and Geographic Data” for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, except in Greater China, where iPhone revenue represented a moderately higher proportion of net sales. As of December 31, 2022 and September 24, 2022, the Company had total deferred revenue of $ 12.6 billion and $ 12.4 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, the Company expects 63 % of total deferred revenue to be realized in less than a year, 27 % within one-to-two years, 8 % within two-to-three years and 2 % in greater than three years.

Apple Inc. | Q1 2023 Form 10-Q | 8 The following table shows the fair value of the Company’s non-current marketable debt securities, by contractual maturity, as of December 31, 2022 (in millions): Due after 1 year through 5 years $ 82,497 Due after 5 years through 10 years 14,243 Due after 10 years 17,355 Total fair value $ 114,095 Derivative Instruments and Hedging The Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates. Foreign Exchange Risk To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, option contracts or other instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months. To protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of December 31, 2022, the maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term debt–related foreign currency transactions is 20 years. The Company may also enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. Interest Rate Risk To protect the Company’s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. The notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments as of December 31, 2022 and September 24, 2022 were as follows (in millions): December 31, 2022 September 24, 2022 Derivative instruments designated as accounting hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ 66,054 $ 102,670 Interest rate contracts $ 20,125 $ 20,125 Derivative instruments not designated as accounting hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ 134,971 $ 185,381 Apple Inc. | Q1 2023 Form 10-Q | 9 The gross fair values of the Company’s derivative assets and liabilities as of September 24, 2022 were as follows (in millions): September 24, 2022 Fair Value of Derivatives Designated as Accounting Hedges Fair Value of Derivatives Not Designated as Accounting Hedges Total Fair Value Derivative assets (1) : Foreign exchange contracts $ 4,317 $ 2,819 $ 7,136 Derivative liabilities (2) : Foreign exchange contracts $ 2,205 $ 2,547 $ 4,752 Interest rate contracts $ 1,367 $ — $ 1,367 (1) Derivative assets are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current assets and other non-current assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. (2) Derivative liabilities are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. The derivative assets above represent the Company’s gross credit exposure if all counterparties failed to perform. To mitigate credit risk, the Company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair values of certain derivatives fluctuate from contractually established thresholds. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to the Company’s derivative contracts, under which the Company is allowed to settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of September 24, 2022, the potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the Company’s derivative contracts, including the effects of collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $ 7.8 billion, resulting in a net derivative asset of $ 412 million. The carrying amounts of the Company’s hedged items in fair value hedges as of December 31, 2022 and September 24, 2022 were as follows (in millions): December 31, 2022 September 24, 2022 Hedged assets/(liabilities): Current and non-current marketable securities $ 14,311 $ 13,378 Current and non-current term debt $ ( 18,731 ) $ ( 18,739 ) Accounts Receivable Trade Receivables The Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, resellers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral or third-party credit support in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements. As of both December 31, 2022 and September 24, 2022, the Company had one customer that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, which accounted for 11 % and 10 %, respectively. The Company’s cellular network carriers accounted for 43 % and 44 % of total trade receivables as of December 31, 2022 and September 24, 2022, respectively. Vendor Non-Trade Receivables The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 54 % and 16 %. As of September 24, 2022, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 54 % and 13 %.

Note 9 – Segment Information and Geographic Data The following table shows information by reportable segment for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021 (in millions): Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 Americas: Net sales $ 49,278 $ 51,496 Operating income $ 17,864 $ 19,585 Europe: Net sales $ 27,681 $ 29,749 Operating income $ 10,017 $ 11,545 Greater China: Net sales $ 23,905 $ 25,783 Operating income $ 10,437 $ 11,183 Japan: Net sales $ 6,755 $ 7,107 Operating income $ 3,236 $ 3,349 Rest of Asia Pacific: Net sales $ 9,535 $ 9,810 Operating income $ 3,851 $ 3,995 Apple Inc. | Q1 2023 Form 10-Q | 13 A reconciliation of the Company’s segment operating income to the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021 is as follows (in millions): Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 Segment operating income $ 45,405 $ 49,657 Research and development expense ( 7,709 ) ( 6,306 ) Other corporate expenses, net ( 1,680 ) ( 1,863 ) Total operating income $ 36,016 $ 41,488 Apple Inc. | Q1 2023 Form 10-Q | 14 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This section and other parts of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“Form 10-Q”) contain forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example, statements in this Form 10-Q regarding the potential future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s business and results of operations are forward-looking statements . Forward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as “future,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “predicts,” “will,” “would,” “could,” “can,” “may,” and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company’s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022 (the “2022 Form 10-K”) under the heading “Risk Factors.” The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law. Unless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Company’s fiscal calendar, and references to particular years, quarters, months or periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Each of the terms the “Company” and “Apple” as used herein refers collectively to Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, unless otherwise stated. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the 2022 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. Available Information The Company periodically provides certain information for investors on its corporate website, www.apple.com, and its investor relations website, investor.apple.com. This includes press releases and other information about financial performance, information on environmental, social and governance matters, and details related to the Company’s annual meeting of shareholders. The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form 10-Q is not incorporated by reference into this filing. Further, the Company’s references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only. Business Seasonality and Product Introductions The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction. Fiscal Period The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company’s fiscal years 2023 and 2022 span 53 and 52 weeks, respectively. Quarterly Highlights Total net sales decreased 5% or $6.8 billion during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 due to the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. The weakness in foreign currencies contributed to lower net sales of iPhone and Mac, which was partially offset by higher net sales of iPad. During the first quarter of 2023, the Company announced a new iPad, a new iPad Pro ® powered by the Apple M2 chip, and a new Apple TV 4K. The Company repurchased $19.0 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $3.8 billion during the first quarter of 2023. Apple Inc. | Q1 2023 Form 10-Q | 15 COVID-19 The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and continues to have, a significant impact around the world, prompting governments and businesses to take unprecedented measures, such as restrictions on travel and business operations, temporary closures of businesses, and quarantine and shelter-in-place orders. The COVID-19 pandemic has at times significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets. The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have affected and could in the future materially impact the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. Certain of the Company’s outsourcing partners, component suppliers and logistical service providers have experienced, and could in the future experience, disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in supply shortages. During the first quarter of 2023, COVID-related impacts temporarily affected the Company’s primary iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max assembly facility located in Zhengzhou, China. The facility operated at significantly reduced capacity, impacting iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone Pro Max shipments. Macroeconomic Conditions Macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, rising interest rates and currency fluctuations, have direct and indirect impacts on the Company’s business. The Company believes these factors have impacted, and could in the future materially impact, the Company’s results of operations and financial condition. Segment Operating Performance The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. Further information regarding the Company’s reportable segments can be found in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 9, “Segment Information and Geographic Data.” The following table shows net sales by reportable segment for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021 (dollars in millions): Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 Change Net sales by reportable segment: Americas $ 49,278 $ 51,496 (4) % Europe 27,681 29,749 (7) % Greater China 23,905 25,783 (7) % Japan 6,755 7,107 (5) % Rest of Asia Pacific 9,535 9,810 (3) % Total net sales $ 117,154 $ 123,945 (5) % Americas Americas net sales decreased during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 due primarily to lower net sales of iPhone and Mac, partially offset by higher net sales of Services and iPad. The weakness of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable year-over-year impact on Americas net sales during the first quarter of 2023. Europe Europe net sales decreased during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 due to the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which contributed to lower net sales of iPhone and Mac. Apple Inc. | Q1 2023 Form 10-Q | 16 Greater China Greater China net sales decreased during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 due to the weakness of the renminbi relative to the U.S. dollar. The weakness of the renminbi contributed to lower net sales of iPhone, which was partially offset by higher net sales of iPad. Japan Japan net sales decreased during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 due to the weakness of the yen relative to the U.S. dollar, which contributed to lower net sales of Services and Mac. Rest of Asia Pacific Rest of Asia Pacific net sales decreased during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 due to the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. The weakness in foreign currencies contributed to lower net sales of iPhone and Mac, which was partially offset by higher net sales of Services and iPad. Products and Services Performance The following table shows net sales by category for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021 (dollars in millions): Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 Change Net sales by category: iPhone (1) $ 65,775 $ 71,628 (8) % Mac (1) 7,735 10,852 (29) % iPad (1) 9,396 7,248 30 % Wearables, Home and Accessories (1)(2) 13,482 14,701 (8) % Services (3) 20,766 19,516 6 % Total net sales $ 117,154 $ 123,945 (5) % (1) Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are bundled in the sales price of the respective product.

(3) Services net sales include sales from the Company’s advertising, AppleCare, cloud, digital content, payment and other services. Services net sales also include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain products. iPhone iPhone net sales decreased during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 due primarily to lower net sales from the Company’s new iPhone models launched in the fourth quarter of 2022. Mac Mac net sales decreased during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 due primarily to lower net sales of MacBook Pro ® . iPad iPad net sales increased during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 due primarily to higher net sales of iPad and iPad Air ® . Apple Inc. | Q1 2023 Form 10-Q | 17 Wearables, Home and Accessories Wearables, Home and Accessories net sales decreased during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 due primarily to lower net sales of AirPods, partially offset by higher net sales of Watch. Services Services net sales increased during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 due primarily to higher net sales from cloud services, the App Store ® and music. Gross Margin Products and Services gross margin and gross margin percentage for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 Gross margin: Products $ 35,623 $ 40,120 Services 14,709 14,123 Total gross margin $ 50,332 $ 54,243 Gross margin percentage: Products 37.0 % 38.4 % Services 70.8 % 72.4 % Total gross margin percentage 43.0 % 43.8 % Products Gross Margin Products gross margin decreased during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 due primarily to the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and lower Products volume. Products gross margin percentage decreased during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 due primarily to the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Services Gross Margin Services gross margin increased during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 due primarily to higher Services net sales, partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Services gross margin percentage decreased during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 due primarily to the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and higher Services costs, partially offset by improved leverage. The Company’s future gross margins can be impacted by a variety of factors, as discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the 2022 Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.” As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and downward pressure. Apple Inc. | Q1 2023 Form 10-Q | 18 Operating Expenses Operating expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 Research and development $ 7,709 $ 6,306 Percentage of total net sales 7 % 5 % Selling, general and administrative $ 6,607 $ 6,449 Percentage of total net sales 6 % 5 % Total operating expenses $ 14,316 $ 12,755 Percentage of total net sales 12 % 10 % Research and Development The growth in research and development (“R&D”) expense during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses. Selling, General and Administrative The growth in selling, general and administrative expense during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses. Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 Provision for income taxes $ 5,625 $ 6,611 Effective tax rate 15.8 % 16.0 % Statutory federal income tax rate 21 % 21 % The Company’s effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2023 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, tax benefits from share-based compensation, and the U.S. federal R&D credit, partially offset by state income taxes. The Company’s effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2023 was lower compared to the same quarter in 2022 due primarily to a higher U.S. federal R&D credit, lower state income taxes and a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, largely offset by lower tax benefits from share-based compensation. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond. The Company’s contractual cash requirements have not changed materially since the 2022 Form 10-K, except for commercial paper and manufacturing purchase obligations. Commercial Paper The Company issues unsecured short-term promissory notes (“Commercial Paper”) pursuant to a commercial paper program. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had $1.7 billion of Commercial Paper outstanding, all of which was payable within 12 months. Apple Inc. | Q1 2023 Form 10-Q | 19 Manufacturing Purchase Obligations The Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company’s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $55.1 billion, with $54.8 billion payable within 12 months. The Company’s manufacturing purchase obligations are primarily noncancelable. In addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has a capital return program authorized by the Board of Directors. The share repurchase program (the “Program”) does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s quarterly cash dividend was $0.23 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to condensed consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of the 2022 Form 10-K describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements. There have been no material changes to the Company’s critical accounting estimates since the 2022 Form 10-K. Item 3.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the first quarter of 2023, which were identified in connection with management’s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Apple Inc. | Q1 2023 Form 10-Q | 20 PART II — OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings Epic Games Epic Games, Inc. (“Epic”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the “Northern California District Court”) against the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California’s unfair competition law based upon the Company’s operation of its App Store. The Company filed a counterclaim for breach of contract. On September 10, 2021, the Northern California District Court ruled in favor of the Company with respect to nine out of the ten counts included in Epic’s claim, and in favor of the Company with respect to the Company’s claims for breach of contract. The Northern California District Court found that certain provisions of the Company’s App Store Review Guidelines violate California’s unfair competition law and issued an injunction. Epic appealed the decision. The Company filed a cross-appeal and has been granted a stay pending the appeal. Other Legal Proceedings The Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the first quarter of 2023 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Item 1A. Risk Factors The Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described in Part I, Item 1A of the 2022 Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.” When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely affected. There have been no material changes to the Company’s risk factors since the 2022 Form 10-K. Item 2.

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation and Preparation The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively “Apple” or the “Company”). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. In the opinion of the Company’s management, the condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation. These condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the Company’s annual consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 25, 2021. The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. The Company’s fiscal years 2022 and 2021 span 52 weeks each. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.

Apple Inc. | Q3 2022 Form 10-Q | 8 The following table shows the fair value of the Company’s non-current marketable debt securities, by contractual maturity, as of June 25, 2022 (in millions): Due after 1 year through 5 years $ 92,970 Due after 5 years through 10 years 19,317 Due after 10 years 18,790 Total fair value $ 131,077 Derivative Instruments and Hedging The Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates. Foreign Exchange Risk To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, option contracts or other instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.

Accounts Receivable Trade Receivables The Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, resellers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral or third-party credit support in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This section and other parts of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“Form 10-Q”) contain forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example, statements in this Form 10-Q regarding the potential future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s business and results of operations are forward-looking statements . Forward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as “future,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “predicts,” “will,” “would,” “could,” “can,” “may,” and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company’s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 25, 2021 (the “2021 Form 10-K”) under the heading “Risk Factors.” The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law. Unless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Company’s fiscal calendar, and references to particular years, quarters, months or periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Each of the terms the “Company” and “Apple” as used herein refers collectively to Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, unless otherwise stated. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the 2021 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. Available Information The Company periodically provides certain information for investors on its corporate website, www.apple.com, and its investor relations website, investor.apple.com. This includes press releases and other information about financial performance, information on environmental, social and corporate governance matters, and details related to the Company’s annual meeting of shareholders. The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form 10-Q is not incorporated by reference into this filing. Further, the Company’s references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only. Business Seasonality and Product Introductions The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction. Quarterly Highlights Total net sales increased 2% or $1.5 billion during the third quarter of 2022 compared to the same quarter in 2021, driven primarily by higher net sales of Services and iPhone, partially offset by lower net sales of Mac and Wearables, Home and Accessories. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable impact on all Products and Services net sales during the third quarter of 2022. At the end of the third quarter of 2022, the Company introduced an all-new MacBook Air ® and an updated 13-inch MacBook Pro ® , both powered by the new Apple M2 chip. The Company also announced iOS 16, macOS ® Ventura, iPadOS ® 16 and watchOS ® 9, updates to its operating systems that are expected to be available in the fall of 2022. The Company repurchased $21.7 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $3.8 billion during the third quarter of 2022. Apple Inc. | Q3 2022 Form 10-Q | 14 COVID-19 The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and continues to have, a significant impact around the world, prompting governments and businesses to take unprecedented measures, such as restrictions on travel and business operations, temporary closures of businesses, and quarantine and shelter-in-place orders. The COVID-19 pandemic has at times significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets. The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have affected and could in the future materially impact the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. Certain of the Company’s outsourcing partners, component suppliers and logistical service providers have experienced disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in supply shortages. Similar disruptions could occur in the future.

Other Income/(Expense), Net Other income/(expense), net (“OI&E”) for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 25, 2022 and June 26, 2021 was as follows (dollars in millions): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended June 25, 2022 June 26, 2021 Change June 25, 2022 June 26, 2021 Change Interest and dividend income $ 722 $ 719 $ 2,072 $ 2,184 Interest expense (719) (665) (2,104) (1,973) Other income/(expense), net (13) 189 (65) 585 Total other income/(expense), net $ (10) $ 243 (104) % $ (97) $ 796 (112) % OI&E decreased during the third quarter and first nine months of 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021 due primarily to fair value adjustments and realized losses on marketable securities and higher interest expense, partially offset by foreign exchange gains. Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 25, 2022 and June 26, 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended June 25, 2022 June 26, 2021 June 25, 2022 June 26, 2021 Provision for income taxes $ 3,624 $ 2,625 $ 15,364 $ 11,830 Effective tax rate 15.7 % 10.8 % 16.3 % 13.8 % Statutory federal income tax rate 21 % 21 % 21 % 21 % The Company’s effective tax rate for the third quarter and first nine months of 2022 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, tax benefits from share-based compensation and the impact of the U.S. federal R&D tax credit, partially offset by state income taxes. Apple Inc. | Q3 2022 Form 10-Q | 18 The Company’s effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2022 was higher compared to the third quarter of 2021 due primarily to a higher effective tax rate on foreign earnings and an adjustment to prior years’ foreign-derived intangible income deductions. The Company’s effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2022 was higher compared to the same period in 2021 due primarily to a higher effective tax rate on foreign earnings, lower tax benefits from share-based compensation, and the impact to U.S. foreign tax credits as a result of regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in January 2022. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond. The Company’s contractual cash requirements have not changed materially since the 2021 Form 10-K, except for manufacturing purchase obligations. Manufacturing Purchase Obligations The Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company’s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. As of June 25, 2022, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $43.1 billion, with $43.0 billion payable within 12 months. The Company’s manufacturing purchase obligations are primarily noncancelable. In addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has a share repurchase program authorized by the Board of Directors (the “Program”). The Program does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of June 25, 2022, the Company’s quarterly cash dividend was $0.23 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to condensed consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of the 2021 Form 10-K describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements. There have been no material changes to the Company’s critical accounting estimates since the 2021 Form 10-K. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk There have been no material changes to the Company’s market risk during the first nine months of 2022. For a discussion of the Company’s exposure to market risk, refer to the Company’s market risk disclosures set forth in Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” of the 2021 Form 10-K. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) were effective as of June 25, 2022 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the third quarter of 2022, which were identified in connection with management’s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Apple Inc. | Q3 2022 Form 10-Q | 19 PART II — OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings Epic Games Epic Games, Inc. (“Epic”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the “Northern California District Court”) against the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California’s unfair competition law based upon the Company’s operation of its App Store. The Company filed a counterclaim for breach of contract. On September 10, 2021, the Northern California District Court ruled in favor of the Company with respect to nine out of the ten counts included in Epic’s claim, and in favor of the Company with respect to the Company’s claims for breach of contract. The Northern California District Court found that certain provisions of the Company’s App Store Review Guidelines violate California’s unfair competition law and issued an injunction. Epic appealed the decision. The Company filed a cross-appeal and has been granted a stay pending the appeal. Other Legal Proceedings The Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the third quarter of 2022 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Item 1A. Risk Factors The Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition, as well as the price of the Company’s stock, can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described in Part I, Item 1A of the 2021 Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.” When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition, as well as the price of the Company’s stock, can be materially and adversely affected. There have been no material changes to the Company’s risk factors since the 2021 Form 10-K. Item 2.

During the third quarter of 2022, the Company also utilized the final $17.6 billion under the $90 billion Program authorization approved in April 2021. The Program does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. Under the Program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act.

In the opinion of the Company’s management, the condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation. These condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the Company’s annual consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 25, 2021. The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. The Company’s fiscal years 2022 and 2021 span 52 weeks each. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.

Apple Inc. | Q2 2022 Form 10-Q | 8 The following table shows the fair value of the Company’s non-current marketable debt securities, by contractual maturity, as of March 26, 2022 (in millions): Due after 1 year through 5 years $ 97,603 Due after 5 years through 10 years 22,899 Due after 10 years 20,717 Total fair value $ 141,219 Derivative Instruments and Hedging The Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates. Foreign Exchange Risk To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, option contracts or other instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months. To protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of March 26, 2022, the Company’s hedged term debt– and marketable securities–related foreign currency transactions are expected to be recognized within 20 years. The Company may also enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. Interest Rate Risk To protect the Company’s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. The notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments as of March 26, 2022 and September 25, 2021 were as follows (in millions): March 26, 2022 September 25, 2021 Derivative instruments designated as accounting hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ 65,140 $ 76,475 Interest rate contracts $ 20,775 $ 16,875 Derivative instruments not designated as accounting hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ 110,758 $ 126,918 The gross fair values of the Company’s derivative assets and liabilities were not material as of March 26, 2022 and September 25, 2021. The gains and losses recognized in other comprehensive income/(loss) and amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) to net income for the Company’s derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges were not material in the three- and six-month periods ended March 26, 2022 and March 27, 2021. Apple Inc. | Q2 2022 Form 10-Q | 9 The carrying amounts of the Company’s hedged items in fair value hedges as of March 26, 2022 and September 25, 2021 were as follows (in millions): March 26, 2022 September 25, 2021 Hedged assets/(liabilities): Current and non-current marketable securities $ 14,943 $ 15,954 Current and non-current term debt $ ( 19,766 ) $ ( 17,857 ) The gains and losses on the Company’s derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges and the related hedged item adjustments were not material in the three- and six-month periods ended March 26, 2022 and March 27, 2021. Accounts Receivable Trade Receivables The Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, resellers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral or third-party credit support in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements. The Company’s cellular network carriers accounted for 36 % and 42 % of total trade receivables as of March 26, 2022 and September 25, 2021, respectively. Vendor Non-Trade Receivables The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. As of March 26, 2022, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 52 % and 12 %. As of September 25, 2021, the Company had three vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 52 %, 11 % and 11 %.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This section and other parts of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“Form 10-Q”) contain forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example, statements in this Form 10-Q regarding the potential future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s business and results of operations are forward-looking statements . Forward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as “future,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “predicts,” “will,” “would,” “could,” “can,” “may,” and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company’s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 25, 2021 (the “2021 Form 10-K”) under the heading “Risk Factors.” The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law. Unless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Company’s fiscal calendar, and references to particular years, quarters, months or periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Each of the terms the “Company” and “Apple” as used herein refers collectively to Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, unless otherwise stated. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the 2021 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. Available Information The Company periodically provides certain information for investors on its corporate website, www.apple.com, and its investor relations website, investor.apple.com. This includes press releases and other information about financial performance, information on environmental, social and corporate governance matters, and details related to the Company’s annual meeting of shareholders. The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form 10-Q is not incorporated by reference into this filing. Further, the Company’s references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only. Business Seasonality and Product Introductions The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction. Quarterly Highlights Total net sales increased 9% or $7.7 billion during the second quarter of 2022 compared to the same quarter in 2021, driven primarily by growth in Services, iPhone and Mac. During the second quarter of 2022, the Company released the following products: • iPhone SE ® with 5G technology; • iPad Air ® , powered by the Apple M1 chip; • All-new Mac Studio™, powered by the Apple M1 Max or the new Apple M1 Ultra chip; and • All-new Apple Studio Display™. The Company repurchased $22.9 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $3.6 billion during the second quarter of 2022. Apple Inc. | Q2 2022 Form 10-Q | 14 COVID-19 Update The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and continues to have, a significant impact around the world, prompting governments and businesses to take unprecedented measures, such as restrictions on travel and business operations, temporary closures of businesses, and quarantine and shelter-in-place orders. The COVID-19 pandemic has at times significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets. The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have affected and could in the future materially impact the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition, as well as the price of the Company’s stock. During the second quarter of 2022, aspects of the Company’s business continued to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with a significant number of the Company’s employees working remotely and many of the Company’s retail stores operating at limited capacity or temporarily closing at various times. Substantially all of the Company’s other facilities are open, subject to operating restrictions to protect public health and the health and safety of employees. The Company continues to work on safely reopening the remainder of its facilities, subject to local rules and regulations. At times, certain of the Company’s outsourcing partners, component suppliers and logistical service providers have experienced disruptions, resulting in supply shortages that could affect sales worldwide. Similar disruptions could occur in the future. The extent of the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s operational and financial performance is uncertain and will depend on many factors outside the Company’s control, including the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic, the emergence of new variants, the development, availability, distribution and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products. Refer to Part I, Item 1A of the 2021 Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors” for more information.

Products gross margin percentage increased during the second quarter of 2022 compared to the second quarter of 2021 due primarily to improved leverage. Year-over-year Products gross margin percentage increased during the first six months of 2022 due primarily to a different Products mix.

Services gross margin percentage increased during the second quarter and first six months of 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021 due primarily to a different Services mix and improved leverage, partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. The Company’s future gross margins can be impacted by a variety of factors, as discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the 2021 Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.” As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and downward pressure. Apple Inc. | Q2 2022 Form 10-Q | 17 Operating Expenses Operating expenses for the three- and six-month periods ended March 26, 2022 and March 27, 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended March 26, 2022 March 27, 2021 March 26, 2022 March 27, 2021 Research and development $ 6,387 $ 5,262 $ 12,693 $ 10,425 Percentage of total net sales 7 % 6 % 6 % 5 % Selling, general and administrative $ 6,193 $ 5,314 $ 12,642 $ 10,945 Percentage of total net sales 6 % 6 % 6 % 5 % Total operating expenses $ 12,580 $ 10,576 $ 25,335 $ 21,370 Percentage of total net sales 13 % 12 % 11 % 11 % Research and Development The growth in research and development (“R&D”) expense during the second quarter and first six months of 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses, engineering program costs and professional services. The Company continues to believe that focused investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace, and to the development of new and updated products and services that are central to the Company’s core business strategy. Selling, General and Administrative The growth in selling, general and administrative expense during the second quarter of 2022 compared to the second quarter of 2021 was driven primarily by increases in advertising, headcount-related expenses and professional services. Year-over-year selling, general and administrative expense increased during the first six months of 2022 due primarily to increases in headcount-related expenses, advertising and variable selling expenses. Other Income/(Expense), Net Other income/(expense), net (“OI&E”) for the three- and six-month periods ended March 26, 2022 and March 27, 2021 was as follows (dollars in millions): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended March 26, 2022 March 27, 2021 Change March 26, 2022 March 27, 2021 Change Interest and dividend income $ 700 $ 718 $ 1,350 $ 1,465 Interest expense (691) (670) (1,385) (1,308) Other income/(expense), net 151 460 (52) 396 Total other income/(expense), net $ 160 $ 508 (69) % $ (87) $ 553 (116) % OI&E decreased during the second quarter and first six months of 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021 due primarily to fair value adjustments on marketable securities, partially offset by foreign exchange gains. Apple Inc. | Q2 2022 Form 10-Q | 18 Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for the three- and six-month periods ended March 26, 2022 and March 27, 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended March 26, 2022 March 27, 2021 March 26, 2022 March 27, 2021 Provision for income taxes $ 5,129 $ 4,381 $ 11,740 $ 9,205 Effective tax rate 17.0 % 15.6 % 16.4 % 14.9 % Statutory federal income tax rate 21 % 21 % 21 % 21 % The Company’s effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2022 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, including the favorable impact of changes in unrecognized tax benefits, partially offset by the impact to U.S. foreign tax credits as a result of regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in January 2022 (the “Regulations”). The Company’s effective tax rate for the first six months of 2022 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, including the favorable impact of changes in unrecognized tax benefits. The Company’s effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2022 was higher compared to the second quarter of 2021 due primarily to the impact to U.S. foreign tax credits as a result of the Regulations, partially offset by a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, including the favorable impact of changes in unrecognized tax benefits. The Company’s effective tax rate for the first six months of 2022 was higher compared to the same period in 2021 due primarily to the impact to U.S. foreign tax credits as a result of the Regulations and lower tax benefits from share-based compensation. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond. The Company’s contractual cash requirements have not changed materially since the 2021 Form 10-K, except for manufacturing purchase obligations. Manufacturing Purchase Obligations The Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company’s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. As of March 26, 2022, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $40.6 billion, with $40.5 billion payable within 12 months. The Company’s manufacturing purchase obligations are primarily noncancelable. In addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has a share repurchase program authorized by the Board of Directors (the “Program”). As of March 26, 2022, the remaining availability under the Program was $17.6 billion. On April 28, 2022, the Company announced the Board of Directors increased the Program authorization by $90 billion. The Program does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. On April 28, 2022, the Company also announced the Board of Directors raised the Company’s quarterly cash dividend from $0.22 to $0.23 per share, beginning with the dividend to be paid during the third quarter of 2022. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to condensed consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of the 2021 Form 10-K describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements. There have been no material changes to the Company’s critical accounting estimates since the 2021 Form 10-K. Apple Inc. | Q2 2022 Form 10-Q | 19 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk There have been no material changes to the Company’s market risk during the first six months of 2022. For a discussion of the Company’s exposure to market risk, refer to the Company’s market risk disclosures set forth in Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” of the 2021 Form 10-K. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) were effective as of March 26, 2022 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the second quarter of 2022, which were identified in connection with management’s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. PART II — OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings Epic Games Epic Games, Inc. (“Epic”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the “Northern California District Court”) against the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California’s unfair competition law based upon the Company’s operation of its App Store. The Company filed a counterclaim for breach of contract. On September 10, 2021, the Northern California District Court ruled in favor of the Company with respect to nine out of the ten counts included in Epic’s claim, and in favor of the Company with respect to the Company’s claims for breach of contract. The Northern California District Court found that certain provisions of the Company’s App Store Review Guidelines violate California’s unfair competition law and issued an injunction. Epic appealed the decision. The Company filed a cross-appeal and has been granted a stay pending the appeal. Other Legal Proceedings The Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the second quarter of 2022 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Item 1A. Risk Factors The Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition, as well as the price of the Company’s stock, can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described in Part I, Item 1A of the 2021 Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.” When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition, as well as the price of the Company’s stock, can be materially and adversely affected. There have been no material changes to the Company’s risk factors since the 2021 Form 10-K. Apple Inc. | Q2 2022 Form 10-Q | 20 Item 2.

Apple Inc. | Q1 2022 Form 10-Q | 5 Apple Inc. Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation and Preparation The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively “Apple” or the “Company”). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. In the opinion of the Company’s management, the condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation. These condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the Company’s annual consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 25, 2021 (the “2021 Form 10-K”). The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. The Company’s fiscal years 2022 and 2021 span 52 weeks each. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.

Apple Inc. | Q1 2022 Form 10-Q | 8 The following table shows the fair value of the Company’s non-current marketable debt securities, by contractual maturity, as of December 25, 2021 (in millions): Due after 1 year through 5 years $ 93,206 Due after 5 years through 10 years 25,183 Due after 10 years 20,294 Total fair value $ 138,683 Derivative Instruments and Hedging The Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates. Foreign Exchange Risk To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, option contracts or other instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months. To protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of December 25, 2021, the Company’s hedged term debt– and marketable securities–related foreign currency transactions are expected to be recognized within 21 years. The Company may also enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. Interest Rate Risk To protect the Company’s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. The notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments as of December 25, 2021 and September 25, 2021 were as follows (in millions): December 25, 2021 September 25, 2021 Derivative instruments designated as accounting hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ 77,009 $ 76,475 Interest rate contracts $ 16,875 $ 16,875 Derivative instruments not designated as accounting hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ 176,268 $ 126,918 The gross fair values of the Company’s derivative assets and liabilities were not material as of December 25, 2021 and September 25, 2021. The gains and losses recognized in other comprehensive income and amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to net income for the Company’s derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges were not material in the three months ended December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020. Apple Inc. | Q1 2022 Form 10-Q | 9 The carrying amounts of the Company’s hedged items in fair value hedges as of December 25, 2021 and September 25, 2021 were as follows (in millions): December 25, 2021 September 25, 2021 Hedged assets/(liabilities): Current and non-current marketable securities $ 15,322 $ 15,954 Current and non-current term debt $ ( 17,444 ) $ ( 17,857 ) The gains and losses on the Company’s derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges and the related hedged item adjustments were not material in the three months ended December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020. Accounts Receivable Trade Receivables The Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, resellers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral or third-party credit support in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements. The Company’s cellular network carriers accounted for 45 % and 42 % of total trade receivables as of December 25, 2021 and September 25, 2021, respectively. Vendor Non-Trade Receivables The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. As of December 25, 2021, the Company had three vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 54 %, 13 % and 12 %. As of September 25, 2021, the Company had three vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 52 %, 11 % and 11 %.

Note 6 – Shareholders’ Equity Share Repurchase Program As of December 25, 2021, the Company was authorized to purchase up to $ 315 billion of the Company’s common stock under a share repurchase program (the “Program”). During the three months ended December 25, 2021, the Company repurchased 124 million shares of its common stock for $ 20.4 billion, including 30 million shares initially delivered under accelerated share repurchase agreements (“ASRs”) entered into in November 2021, bringing the total utilization under the Program to $ 274.5 billion as of December 25, 2021. The Program does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares. Under the Program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Apple Inc. | Q1 2022 Form 10-Q | 11 Under the terms of the Company’s ASRs, two financial institutions committed to deliver shares of the Company’s common stock during the purchase periods in exchange for up-front payments totaling $ 6.0 billion. The total number of shares ultimately delivered under the ASRs, and therefore the average repurchase price paid per share, is determined based on the volume-weighted average price of the Company’s common stock during the ASRs’ purchase periods, which end in the second quarter of 2022. The shares received are retired in the periods they are delivered, and the up-front payments are accounted for as a reduction to retained earnings in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Statement of Shareholders’ Equity in the period the payments are made.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This section and other parts of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“Form 10-Q”) contain forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example, statements in this Form 10-Q regarding the potential future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s business and results of operations are forward-looking statements . Forward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as “future,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “predicts,” “will,” “would,” “could,” “can,” “may,” and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company’s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 25, 2021 (the “2021 Form 10-K”) under the heading “Risk Factors.” The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law. Unless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Company’s fiscal calendar, and references to particular years, quarters, months or periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Each of the terms the “Company” and “Apple” as used herein refers collectively to Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, unless otherwise stated. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the 2021 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. Available Information The Company periodically provides certain information for investors on its corporate website, www.apple.com, and its investor relations website, investor.apple.com. This includes press releases and other information about financial performance, information on environmental, social and corporate governance matters, and details related to the Company’s annual meeting of shareholders. The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form 10-Q is not incorporated by reference into this filing. Further, the Company’s references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only. Quarterly Highlights Business Seasonality and Product Introductions The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction. COVID-19 Update The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and continues to have, a significant impact around the world, prompting governments and businesses to take unprecedented measures, such as restrictions on travel and business operations, temporary closures of businesses, and quarantine and shelter-in-place orders. The COVID-19 pandemic has at times significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets. The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have affected and could in the future materially impact the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition, as well as the price of the Company’s stock. During the first quarter of 2022, aspects of the Company’s business continued to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with a significant number of the Company’s employees working remotely and certain of the Company’s retail stores operating at limited capacity or temporarily closing at various times. The Company has reopened substantially all of its other facilities, subject to operating restrictions to protect public health and the health and safety of employees, and it continues to work on safely reopening the remainder of its facilities, subject to local rules and regulations. At times, certain of the Company’s component suppliers and logistical service providers have experienced disruptions, resulting in supply shortages that affected sales worldwide. Similar impacts or other disruptions could occur in the future. Apple Inc. | Q1 2022 Form 10-Q | 14 The extent of the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s operational and financial performance is uncertain and will depend on many factors outside the Company’s control, including the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic, the emergence of new variants, the development, availability, distribution and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products. Refer to Part I, Item 1A of the 2021 Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors” for more information.

Services Gross Margin Services gross margin increased during the first quarter of 2022 compared to the same quarter in 2021 due primarily to higher Services net sales and a different Services mix. Services gross margin percentage increased during the first quarter of 2022 compared to the same quarter in 2021 due primarily to a different Services mix and leverage, partially offset by higher Services costs. The Company’s future gross margins can be impacted by a variety of factors, as discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the 2021 Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.” As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and downward pressure. Operating Expenses Operating expenses for the three months ended December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020 were as follows (dollars in millions): Three Months Ended December 25, 2021 December 26, 2020 Research and development $ 6,306 $ 5,163 Percentage of total net sales 5 % 5 % Selling, general and administrative $ 6,449 $ 5,631 Percentage of total net sales 5 % 5 % Total operating expenses $ 12,755 $ 10,794 Percentage of total net sales 10 % 10 % Apple Inc. | Q1 2022 Form 10-Q | 17 Research and Development The growth in research and development (“R&D”) expense during the first quarter of 2022 compared to the same quarter in 2021 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses, engineering program costs and infrastructure-related costs. The Company continues to believe that focused investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace, and to the development of new and updated products and services that are central to the Company’s core business strategy. Selling, General and Administrative The growth in selling, general and administrative expense during the first quarter of 2022 compared to the same quarter in 2021 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses, variable selling expenses and professional services. Other Income/(Expense), Net Other income/(expense), net (“OI&E”) for the three months ended December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020 was as follows (dollars in millions): Three Months Ended December 25, 2021 December 26, 2020 Change Interest and dividend income $ 650 $ 747 Interest expense (694) (638) Other expense, net (203) (64) Total other income/(expense), net $ (247) $ 45 (649) % OI&E decreased during the first quarter of 2022 compared to the same quarter in 2021 due primarily to higher net losses on marketable and non-marketable securities and lower interest income. Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for the three months ended December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020 were as follows (dollars in millions): Three Months Ended December 25, 2021 December 26, 2020 Provision for income taxes $ 6,611 $ 4,824 Effective tax rate 16.0 % 14.4 % Statutory federal income tax rate 21 % 21 % The Company’s effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2022 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings and tax benefits from share-based compensation. The Company’s effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2022 was higher compared to the same quarter in 2021 due primarily to lower tax benefits from share-based compensation and a change in geographic mix of earnings. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond. The Company’s cash requirements have not changed materially since the 2021 Form 10-K, except for manufacturing purchase obligations. Apple Inc. | Q1 2022 Form 10-Q | 18 Manufacturing Purchase Obligations The Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company’s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. As of December 25, 2021, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $47.6 billion, with $47.5 billion payable within 12 months. The Company’s manufacturing purchase obligations are primarily noncancelable. In addition to its cash requirements, the Company has a capital return program authorized by the Board of Directors. The share repurchase program (the “Program”) does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares. As of December 25, 2021, the Company’s quarterly cash dividend was $0.22 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to condensed consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of the 2021 Form 10-K describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements. There have been no material changes to the Company’s critical accounting estimates since the 2021 Form 10-K. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk There have been no material changes to the Company’s market risk during the first three months of 2022. For a discussion of the Company’s exposure to market risk, refer to the Company’s market risk disclosures set forth in Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” of the 2021 Form 10-K. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) were effective as of December 25, 2021 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the first quarter of 2022, which were identified in connection with management’s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Apple Inc. | Q1 2022 Form 10-Q | 19 PART II — OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings Epic Games Epic Games, Inc. (“Epic”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the “Northern California District Court”) against the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California’s unfair competition law based upon the Company’s operation of its App Store. The Company filed a counterclaim for breach of contract. On September 10, 2021, the Northern California District Court ruled in favor of the Company with respect to nine out of the ten counts included in Epic’s claim, and in favor of the Company with respect to the Company’s claims for breach of contract. The Northern California District Court found that certain provisions of the Company’s App Store Review Guidelines violate California’s unfair competition law and issued an injunction. Epic appealed the decision. The Company filed a cross-appeal and has been granted a stay pending the appeal. Other Legal Proceedings The Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the first quarter of 2022 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Item 1A. Risk Factors The Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition, as well as the price of the Company’s stock, can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described in Part I, Item 1A of the 2021 Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.” When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition, as well as the price of the Company’s stock, can be materially and adversely affected. There have been no material changes to the Company’s risk factors since the 2021 Form 10-K. Apple Inc. | Q1 2022 Form 10-Q | 20 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers Share repurchase activity during the three months ended December 25, 2021 was as follows (in millions, except number of shares, which are reflected in thousands, and per share amounts): Periods Total Number of Shares Purchased Average Price Paid Per Share Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs Approximate Dollar Value of Shares That May Yet Be Purchased Under the Plans or Programs (1) September 26, 2021 to October 30, 2021: Open market and privately negotiated purchases 41,416 $ 144.87 41,416 October 31, 2021 to November 27, 2021: November 2021 ASRs 30,405 (2) (2) 30,405 (2) Open market and privately negotiated purchases 27,770 $ 153.08 27,770 November 28, 2021 to December 25, 2021: Open market and privately negotiated purchases 24,218 $ 169.76 24,218 Total 123,809 $ 40,489 (1) As of December 25, 2021, the Company was authorized to purchase up to $315 billion of the Company’s common stock under the Program, announced on April 28, 2021, of which $274.5 billion had been utilized. The remaining $40.5 billion in the table represents the amount available to repurchase shares under the Program as of December 25, 2021. The Program does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares. Under the Program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act. (2) In November 2021, the Company entered into new accelerated share repurchase agreements (“ASRs”). Under the terms of the agreements, two financial institutions committed to deliver shares of the Company’s common stock during the purchase periods in exchange for up-front payments totaling $6.0 billion. The total number of shares ultimately delivered under the ASRs, and therefore the average repurchase price paid per share, is determined based on the volume-weighted average price of the Company’s common stock during the ASRs’ purchase periods, which end in the second quarter of 2022. Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities None. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures Not applicable. Item 5.

Apple Inc. | Q3 2021 Form 10-Q | 5 Apple Inc. Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation and Preparation The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively “Apple” or the “Company”). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. In the opinion of the Company’s management, the condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation. These condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the Company’s annual consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 26, 2020 (the “2020 Form 10-K”). The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. The Company’s fiscal years 2021 and 2020 span 52 weeks each. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Common Stock Split On August 28, 2020, the Company effected a four -for-one stock split to shareholders of record as of August 24, 2020. All share, restricted stock unit (“RSU”) and per share or per RSU information has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Financial Instruments – Credit Losses At the beginning of the first quarter of 2021, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“ASU 2016-13”), which modifies the measurement of expected credit losses on certain financial instruments. The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 did not have a material impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements. Earnings Per Share The following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 26, 2021 and June 27, 2020 (net income in millions and shares in thousands): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended June 26, 2021 June 27, 2020 June 26, 2021 June 27, 2020 Numerator: Net income $ 21,744 $ 11,253 $ 74,129 $ 44,738 Denominator: Weighted-average basic shares outstanding 16,629,371 17,250,291 16,772,656 17,450,284 Effect of dilutive securities 152,364 168,863 168,871 168,494 Weighted-average diluted shares 16,781,735 17,419,154 16,941,527 17,618,778 Basic earnings per share $ 1.31 $ 0.65 $ 4.42 $ 2.56 Diluted earnings per share $ 1.30 $ 0.65 $ 4.38 $ 2.54 Apple Inc. | Q3 2021 Form 10-Q | 6 Note 2 – Revenue Recognition Net sales consist of revenue from the sale of iPhone ® , Mac ® , iPad ® , Services and other products. The Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is transferred to its customers. Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company’s Products net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company’s Services net sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable. The Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer incentive programs based on the Company’s expectations and historical experience. For arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the Company allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (“SSPs”). When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are established that reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company’s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation. The Company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud ® , Siri ® and Maps. The third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company’s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided. Cost of sales related to delivered hardware and bundled software, including estimated warranty costs, are recognized at the time of sale. Costs incurred to provide product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights are recognized as cost of sales as incurred. For certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For these arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized revenue, and has elected not to disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services. For the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products including, but not limited to, evaluating if it can establish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party applications sold through the App Store ® and certain digital content sold through the Company’s other digital content stores, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for such sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission it retains. The Company has elected to record revenue net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities, with the collected taxes recorded within other current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority. Deferred Revenue As of June 26, 2021 and September 26, 2020, the Company had total deferred revenue of $ 12.0 billion and $ 10.2 billion, respectively. As of June 26, 2021, the Company expects 64 % of total deferred revenue to be realized in less than a year, 26 % within one-to-two years, 8 % within two-to-three years and 2 % in greater than three years. Apple Inc. | Q3 2021 Form 10-Q | 7 Disaggregated Revenue Net sales disaggregated by significant products and services for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 26, 2021 and June 27, 2020 were as follows (in millions): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended June 26, 2021 June 27, 2020 June 26, 2021 June 27, 2020 iPhone (1) $ 39,570 $ 26,418 $ 153,105 $ 111,337 Mac (1) 8,235 7,079 26,012 19,590 iPad (1) 7,368 6,582 23,610 16,927 Wearables, Home and Accessories (1)(2) 8,775 6,450 29,582 22,744 Services (3) 17,486 13,156 50,148 39,219 Total net sales (4) $ 81,434 $ 59,685 $ 282,457 $ 209,817 (1) Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are bundled in the sales price of the respective product.

(2) Level 2 fair value estimates are based on observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. (3) As of June 26, 2021 and September 26, 2020, total marketable securities included $ 18.9 billion and $ 18.6 billion, respectively, that was restricted from general use, related to the State Aid Decision (refer to Note 5, “Income Taxes”) and other agreements. Apple Inc. | Q3 2021 Form 10-Q | 9 The Company may sell certain of its marketable debt securities prior to their stated maturities for reasons including, but not limited to, managing liquidity, credit risk, duration and asset allocation. The following table shows the fair value of the Company’s non-current marketable debt securities, by contractual maturity, as of June 26, 2021 (in millions): Due after 1 year through 5 years $ 83,577 Due after 5 years through 10 years 26,324 Due after 10 years 22,047 Total fair value $ 131,948 The Company typically invests in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company’s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. Fair values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. Non-Marketable Securities The Company holds non-marketable equity securities of certain privately held companies without readily determinable fair values. As of both June 26, 2021 and September 26, 2020, the Company’s non-marketable equity securities had a carrying value of $ 2.8 billion. Restricted Cash A reconciliation of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets to cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as of June 26, 2021 and September 26, 2020 is as follows (in millions): June 26, 2021 September 26, 2020 Cash and cash equivalents $ 34,050 $ 38,016 Restricted cash 1,226 1,773 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 35,276 $ 39,789 The Company’s restricted cash primarily consisted of cash to support the Company’s iPhone Upgrade Program. Substantially all of the Company’s restricted cash was included in other non-current assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Derivative Financial Instruments The Company may use derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risk on expected future cash flows, net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries, and certain existing assets and liabilities. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign currency exchange or interest rates. To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar may hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue, and subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar may hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries’ functional currencies. The Company may enter into forward contracts, option contracts or other instruments to manage this risk and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months. To protect the net investment in a foreign operation from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset a portion of the changes in the carrying amounts of these investments due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, the Company may use non-derivative financial instruments, such as its foreign currency–denominated debt, as hedges of its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries. In both of these cases, the Company designates these instruments as net investment hedges. To protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. These instruments may offset a portion of the foreign currency remeasurement gains or losses, or changes in fair value. The Company may designate these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of June 26, 2021, the Company’s hedged term debt– and marketable securities–related foreign currency transactions are expected to be recognized within 21 years. Apple Inc. | Q3 2021 Form 10-Q | 10 The Company may also enter into non-designated foreign currency contracts to offset a portion of the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. To protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. These instruments may offset a portion of the changes in interest income or expense, or changes in fair value. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of June 26, 2021, the Company’s hedged interest rate transactions are expected to be recognized within six years . Cash Flow Hedges Cash flow hedge amounts that are included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (“AOCI”) until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of foreign currency revenue are recognized as a component of net sales in the same period as the related revenue is recognized, and deferred gains and losses related to cash flow hedges of inventory purchases are recognized as a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related costs are recognized. Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of interest income or expense are recognized in other income/(expense), net (“OI&E”) in the same period as the related income or expense is recognized. For options designated as cash flow hedges, the time value is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognized in the financial statement line item to which the hedge relates on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in other comprehensive income/(loss) (“OCI”). Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially identified time period or within a subsequent two-month time period. Deferred gains and losses in AOCI associated with such derivative instruments are reclassified into OI&E in the period of de-designation. Any subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are reflected in OI&E unless they are re-designated as hedges of other transactions. Net Investment Hedges Net investment hedge amounts that are included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recorded in OCI as a part of the cumulative translation adjustment. For foreign exchange forward contracts designated as net investment hedges, the forward carry component is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognized in OCI on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OCI. Fair Value Hedges Fair value hedge gains and losses related to amounts that are included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in earnings along with a corresponding loss or gain related to the change in value of the hedged item in the same line in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. For foreign exchange forward contracts designated as fair value hedges, the forward carry component is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognized in OI&E on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge. Amounts excluded from the effectiveness assessment of fair value hedges and recognized in OI&E were gains of $ 57 million and $ 199 million for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 26, 2021, respectively, and were gains of $ 119 million and $ 373 million for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 27, 2020, respectively. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OCI. Non-Designated Derivatives Derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are adjusted to fair value through earnings in the financial statement line item to which the derivative relates. Apple Inc. | Q3 2021 Form 10-Q | 11 The Company records all derivatives in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The Company’s accounting treatment for these derivative instruments is based on its hedge designation. The following tables show the Company’s derivative instruments at gross fair value as of June 26, 2021 and September 26, 2020 (in millions): June 26, 2021 Fair Value of Derivatives Designated as Hedge Instruments Fair Value of Derivatives Not Designated as Hedge Instruments Total Fair Value Derivative assets (1) : Foreign exchange contracts $ 700 $ 510 $ 1,210 Interest rate contracts $ 891 $ — $ 891 Derivative liabilities (2) : Foreign exchange contracts $ 918 $ 601 $ 1,519 September 26, 2020 Fair Value of Derivatives Designated as Hedge Instruments Fair Value of Derivatives Not Designated as Hedge Instruments Total Fair Value Derivative assets (1) : Foreign exchange contracts $ 749 $ 303 $ 1,052 Interest rate contracts $ 1,557 $ — $ 1,557 Derivative liabilities (2) : Foreign exchange contracts $ 1,561 $ 485 $ 2,046 (1) The fair value of derivative assets is measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and is included in other current assets and other non-current assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. (2) The fair value of derivative liabilities is measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and is included in other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company classifies cash flows related to derivative financial instruments as operating activities in its Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The following table shows the pre-tax gains and losses of the Company’s derivative and non-derivative instruments designated as cash flow and net investment hedges in OCI and the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 26, 2021 and June 27, 2020 (in millions): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended June 26, 2021 June 27, 2020 June 26, 2021 June 27, 2020 Gains/(Losses) recognized in OCI – included in effectiveness assessment: Cash flow hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ ( 87 ) $ 366 $ 60 $ 175 Interest rate contracts — ( 6 ) 93 ( 72 ) Total $ ( 87 ) $ 360 $ 153 $ 103 Net investment hedges: Foreign currency debt $ — $ ( 20 ) $ — $ 15 Gains/(Losses) reclassified from AOCI into net income – included in effectiveness assessment: Cash flow hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ 9 $ 1,389 $ ( 562 ) $ 1,063 Interest rate contracts ( 1 ) ( 3 ) ( 6 ) ( 6 ) Total $ 8 $ 1,386 $ ( 568 ) $ 1,057 Apple Inc. | Q3 2021 Form 10-Q | 12 Amounts excluded from the effectiveness assessment of the Company’s hedges and recognized in OCI were a gain of $ 63 million and a loss of $ 34 million for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 26, 2021, respectively, and were losses of $ 220 million and $ 51 million for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 27, 2020, respectively. The following tables show information about the Company’s derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges and the related hedged items for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 26, 2021 and June 27, 2020 and as of June 26, 2021 and September 26, 2020 (in millions): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended June 26, 2021 June 27, 2020 June 26, 2021 June 27, 2020 Gains/(Losses) on derivative instruments (1) : Foreign exchange contracts $ ( 130 ) $ ( 675 ) $ ( 313 ) $ ( 422 ) Interest rate contracts ( 32 ) 57 ( 650 ) 1,185 Total $ ( 162 ) $ ( 618 ) $ ( 963 ) $ 763 Gains/(Losses) related to hedged items (1) : Marketable securities $ 130 $ 675 $ 313 $ 422 Fixed-rate debt 32 ( 57 ) 650 ( 1,185 ) Total $ 162 $ 618 $ 963 $ ( 763 ) June 26, 2021 September 26, 2020 Carrying amounts of hedged assets/(liabilities): Marketable securities (2) $ 16,254 $ 16,270 Fixed-rate debt (3) $ ( 18,384 ) $ ( 21,033 ) Cumulative hedging adjustments included in the carrying amounts of hedged items: Marketable securities carrying amount increases/(decreases) $ 538 $ 493 Fixed-rate debt carrying amount (increases)/decreases $ ( 891 ) $ ( 1,541 ) (1) Gains and losses related to fair value hedges are included in OI&E in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. (2) The carrying amounts of marketable securities that are designated as hedged items in fair value hedges are included in current marketable securities and non-current marketable securities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets (3) The carrying amounts of fixed-rate debt instruments that are designated as hedged items in fair value hedges are included in current term debt and non-current term debt in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The following table shows the notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments and credit risk amounts associated with outstanding or unsettled derivative instruments as of June 26, 2021 and September 26, 2020 (in millions): June 26, 2021 September 26, 2020 Notional Amount Credit Risk Amount Notional Amount Credit Risk Amount Instruments designated as accounting hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ 53,914 $ 700 $ 57,410 $ 749 Interest rate contracts $ 17,500 $ 891 $ 20,700 $ 1,557 Instruments not designated as accounting hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ 95,910 $ 510 $ 88,636 $ 303 Apple Inc. | Q3 2021 Form 10-Q | 13 The notional amounts for outstanding derivative instruments provide one measure of the transaction volume outstanding and do not represent the amount of the Company’s exposure to credit or market loss. The credit risk amounts represent the Company’s gross exposure to potential accounting loss on derivative instruments that are outstanding or unsettled if all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current currency or interest rates at each respective date. The Company’s exposure to credit loss and market risk will vary over time as currency and interest rates change. Although the table above reflects the notional and credit risk amounts of the Company’s derivative instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses associated with the exposures and transactions that the instruments are intended to hedge. The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments. The Company generally enters into master netting arrangements, which are designed to reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. The Company presents its derivative assets and derivative liabilities at their gross fair values in its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of June 26, 2021 and September 26, 2020, the net cash collateral received by the Company related to derivative instruments under its collateral security arrangements was $ 576 million and $ 875 million, respectively. The Company includes gross collateral posted and received in other current assets and other current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, respectively. Under master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to the Company’s derivative contracts, the Company is allowed to net settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of June 26, 2021 and September 26, 2020, the potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the Company’s derivative contracts, including the effects of collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $ 2.2 billion and $ 2.8 billion, respectively, resulting in a net derivative asset of $ 6 million and a net derivative liability of $ 312 million, respectively. Accounts Receivable Trade Receivables The Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, resellers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral or third-party credit support in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements. As of both June 26, 2021 and September 26, 2020, the Company had no customers that individually represented 10% or more of total trade receivables. The Company’s cellular network carriers accounted for 36 % of total trade receivables as of June 26, 2021. Vendor Non-Trade Receivables The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. As of June 26, 2021, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 56 % and 13 %. As of September 26, 2020, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 57 % and 11 %. Apple Inc. | Q3 2021 Form 10-Q | 14 Note 4 – Condensed Consolidated Financial Statement Details The following tables show the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statement details as of June 26, 2021 and September 26, 2020 (in millions): Property, Plant and Equipment, Net June 26, 2021 September 26, 2020 Land and buildings $ 19,149 $ 17,952 Machinery, equipment and internal-use software 78,981 75,291 Leasehold improvements 10,727 10,283 Gross property, plant and equipment 108,857 103,526 Accumulated depreciation and amortization ( 70,242 ) ( 66,760 ) Total property, plant and equipment, net $ 38,615 $ 36,766 Other Non-Current Liabilities June 26, 2021 September 26, 2020 Long-term taxes payable $ 24,923 $ 28,170 Other non-current liabilities 27,131 26,320 Total other non-current liabilities $ 52,054 $ 54,490 Other Income/(Expense), Net The following table shows the detail of OI&E for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 26, 2021 and June 27, 2020 (in millions): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended June 26, 2021 June 27, 2020 June 26, 2021 June 27, 2020 Interest and dividend income $ 719 $ 901 $ 2,184 $ 2,995 Interest expense ( 665 ) ( 697 ) ( 1,973 ) ( 2,239 ) Other income/(expense), net 189 ( 158 ) 585 ( 79 ) Total other income/(expense), net $ 243 $ 46 $ 796 $ 677 Note 5 – Income Taxes Uncertain Tax Positions As of June 26, 2021, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $ 16.8 billion, of which $ 7.6 billion, if recognized, would impact the Company’s effective tax rate. The Company had accrued $ 1.6 billion of gross interest and penalties related to income tax matters as of June 26, 2021. The Company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and many state and foreign jurisd ictions. Tax years after 2015 for the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and after 2014 in certain major foreign jurisdictions, remain subject to examination. The Company believes that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax examinations cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Company’s tax examinations are resolved in a manner inconsistent with its expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs. Although the timing of resolution and/or closure of examinations is not certain, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that its gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease in the next 12 months by as much as $ 2.4 billion. Apple Inc. | Q3 2021 Form 10-Q | 15 European Commission State Aid Decision On August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company (the “State Aid Decision”). The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The recovery amount was calculated to be € 13.1 billion, plus interest of € 1.2 billion. The Company and Ireland appealed the State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the “General Court”). On July 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September 25, 2020, the European Commission appealed the General Court’s decision to the European Court of Justice. The Company believes that any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision would be creditable against U.S. taxes, subject to any foreign tax credit limitations in the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. On an annual basis, the Company may request approval from the Irish Minister for Finance to reduce the recovery amount for certain taxes paid to other countries. As of June 26, 2021, the adjusted recovery amount was € 12.7 billion, excluding interest. The adjusted recovery amount plus interest is funded into escrow, where it will remain restricted from general use pending the conclusion of all legal proceedings. Refer to the Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities section of Note 3, “Financial Instruments” for more information. Note 6 – Debt Commercial Paper and Repurchase Agreements The Company issues unsecured short-term promissory notes (“Commercial Paper”) pursuant to a commercial paper program. The Company uses net proceeds from the commercial paper program for general corporate purposes, including dividends and share repurchases. As of June 26, 2021 and September 26, 2020, the Company had $ 8.0 billion and $ 5.0 billion of Commercial Paper outstanding, respectively, with maturities generally less than nine months . The weighted-average interest rate of the Company’s Commercial Paper was 0.04 % and 0.62 % as of June 26, 2021 and September 26, 2020, respectively. The following table provides a summary of cash flows associated with the issuance and maturities of Commercial Paper for the nine months ended June 26, 2021 and June 27, 2020 (in millions): Nine Months Ended June 26, 2021 June 27, 2020 Maturities 90 days or less: Proceeds from commercial paper, net $ 2,745 $ 401 Maturities greater than 90 days: Proceeds from commercial paper 3,993 5,373 Repayments of commercial paper ( 3,716 ) ( 5,743 ) Proceeds from/(Repayments of) commercial paper, net 277 ( 370 ) Total proceeds from commercial paper, net $ 3,022 $ 31 In 2020, the Company entered into agreements to sell certain of its marketable securities with a promise to repurchase the securities at a specified time and amount (“Repos”). Due to the Company’s continuing involvement with the marketable securities, the Company accounted for its Repos as collateralized borrowings. As of September 26, 2020, the Repos had been settled. Apple Inc. | Q3 2021 Form 10-Q | 16 Term Debt As of June 26, 2021, the Company had outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $ 113.2 billion (collectively the “Notes”).

Additionally, to manage foreign currency risk on certain of its foreign currency–denominated notes, the Company has entered into foreign currency swaps to effectively convert these notes to U.S. dollar–denominated notes. The effective interest rates for the Notes include the interest on the Notes, amortization of the discount or premium and, if applicable, adjustments related to hedging. The Company recognized $ 657 million and $ 1.9 billion of interest cost on its term debt for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 26, 2021, respectively. The Company recognized $ 664 million and $ 2.1 billion of interest cost on its term debt for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 27, 2020, respectively. As of June 26, 2021 and September 26, 2020, the fair value of the Company’s Notes, based on Level 2 inputs, was $ 120.3 billion and $ 117.1 billion, respectively. Note 7 – Shareholders’ Equity Share Repurchase Program As of June 26, 2021, the Company was authorized to purchase up to $ 315 billion of the Company’s common stock under a share repurchase program (the “Program”). During the nine months ended June 26, 2021, the Company repurchased 515 million shares of its common stock for $ 65.5 billion, including 32 million shares initially delivered under a May 2021 accelerated share repurchase agreement (“ASR”), bringing the total utilization under the Program to $ 234.1 billion. The Program does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares. Under the Program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Under the terms of the Company’s May 2021 ASR, a financial institution committed to deliver shares of the Company’s common stock during the purchase period in exchange for an up-front payment of $ 5.0 billion. The total number of shares ultimately delivered under the ASR, and therefore the average repurchase price paid per share, is determined based on the volume-weighted average price of the Company’s common stock during the ASR’s purchase period, which will end in or before August 2021. The shares received are retired in the periods they are delivered, and the up-front payment is accounted for as a reduction to retained earnings in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Statement of Shareholders’ Equity in the period the payment is made. Apple Inc. | Q3 2021 Form 10-Q | 17 Note 8 – Comprehensive Income The Company’s OCI consists of foreign currency translation adjustments from those subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, net deferred gains and losses on certain derivative instruments accounted for as hedges, and unrealized gains and losses on marketable debt securities classified as available-for-sale. The following table shows the pre-tax amounts reclassified from AOCI into the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, and the associated financial statement line items, for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 26, 2021 and June 27, 2020 (in millions): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended Comprehensive Income Components Financial Statement Line Items June 26, 2021 June 27, 2020 June 26, 2021 June 27, 2020 Unrealized (gains)/losses on derivative instruments: Foreign exchange contracts Total net sales $ 60 $ ( 270 ) $ 478 $ ( 333 ) Total cost of sales 101 ( 362 ) 752 ( 521 ) Other income/(expense), net ( 155 ) ( 760 ) ( 590 ) ( 212 ) Interest rate contracts Other income/(expense), net 1 3 6 6 7 ( 1,389 ) 646 ( 1,060 ) Unrealized (gains)/losses on marketable debt securities Other income/(expense), net ( 70 ) ( 14 ) ( 284 ) 10 Total amounts reclassified from AOCI $ ( 63 ) $ ( 1,403 ) $ 362 $ ( 1,050 ) The following table shows the changes in AOCI by component for the nine months ended June 26, 2021 (in millions): Cumulative Foreign Currency Translation Unrealized Gains/Losses on Derivative Instruments Unrealized Gains/Losses on Marketable Debt Securities Total Balances as of September 26, 2020 $ ( 1,375 ) $ ( 877 ) $ 1,846 $ ( 406 ) Other comprehensive income/(loss) before reclassifications 659 81 ( 783 ) ( 43 ) Amounts reclassified from AOCI — 646 ( 284 ) 362 Tax effect — ( 130 ) 275 145 Other comprehensive income/(loss) 659 597 ( 792 ) 464 Balances as of June 26, 2021 $ ( 716 ) $ ( 280 ) $ 1,054 $ 58 Note 9 – Benefit Plans Stock Plans The Company had 757 million shares reserved for future issuance under its stock plans as of June 26, 2021. RSUs granted under the Company’s stock plans generally vest over four years , based on continued employment, and are settled upon vesting in shares of the Company’s common stock on a one -for-one basis. RSUs granted under the Company’s stock plans reduce the number of shares available for grant under the plans by a factor of two times the number of RSUs granted. RSUs canceled and shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations increase the number of shares available for grant under the plans utilizing a factor of two times the number of RSUs canceled or shares withheld. Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans During the three months ended June 26, 2021, Section 16 officers Katherine L. Adams, Timothy D. Cook, Luca Maestri, Deirdre O’Brien and Jeffrey Williams had equity trading plans in place in accordance with Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) under the Exchange Act. An equity trading plan is a written document that pre-establishes the amounts, prices and dates (or formula for determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of the Company’s stock, including shares acquired under the Company’s employee and director equity plans. Apple Inc. | Q3 2021 Form 10-Q | 18 Restricted Stock Units A summary of the Company’s RSU activity and related information for the nine months ended June 26, 2021 is as follows: Number of RSUs (in thousands) Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value Per RSU Aggregate Fair Value (in millions) Balance as of September 26, 2020 310,778 $ 51.58 RSUs granted 85,052 $ 114.68 RSUs vested ( 134,462 ) $ 51.59 RSUs canceled ( 10,396 ) $ 67.08 Balance as of June 26, 2021 250,972 $ 72.31 $ 33,407 The fair value as of the respective vesting dates of RSUs was $ 7.9 billion and $ 17.3 billion for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 26, 2021, respectively, and was $ 5.0 billion and $ 9.8 billion for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 27, 2020, respectively. Share-Based Compensation The following table shows share-based compensation expense and the related income tax benefit included in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 26, 2021 and June 27, 2020 (in millions): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended June 26, 2021 June 27, 2020 June 26, 2021 June 27, 2020 Share-based compensation expense $ 1,960 $ 1,698 $ 5,961 $ 5,105 Income tax benefit related to share-based compensation expense $ ( 1,319 ) $ ( 740 ) $ ( 3,518 ) $ ( 1,942 ) As of June 26, 2021, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding RSUs and stock options was $ 15.3 billion, which the Company expects to recognize over a weighted-average period of 2.7 years. Note 10 – Commitments and Contingencies Accrued Warranty and Guarantees The following table shows changes in the Company’s accrued warranties and related costs for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 26, 2021 and June 27, 2020 (in millions): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended June 26, 2021 June 27, 2020 June 26, 2021 June 27, 2020 Beginning accrued warranty and related costs $ 3,784 $ 3,923 $ 3,354 $ 3,570 Cost of warranty claims ( 636 ) ( 576 ) ( 2,008 ) ( 2,180 ) Accruals for product warranty 384 557 2,186 2,514 Ending accrued warranty and related costs $ 3,532 $ 3,904 $ 3,532 $ 3,904 The Company offers an iPhone Upgrade Program, which is available to customers who purchase a qualifying iPhone in the U.S., the U.K. and China mainland. The iPhone Upgrade Program provides customers the right to trade in that iPhone for a specified amount when purchasing a new iPhone, provided certain conditions are met. The Company accounts for the trade-in right as a guarantee liability and recognizes arrangement revenue net of the fair value of such right, with subsequent changes to the guarantee liability recognized within net sales. Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product Although most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets and other electronic devices. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. Apple Inc. | Q3 2021 Form 10-Q | 19 The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements. The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Substantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia, with some Mac computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland. Unconditional Purchase Obligations The Company has entered into certain off–balance sheet commitments that require the future purchase of goods or services (“unconditional purchase obligations”). The Company’s unconditional purchase obligations primarily consist of payments for content creation, Internet and telecommunications services and supplier arrangements. As of June 26, 2021, the Company’s total future payments under noncancelable unconditional purchase obligations having a remaining term in excess of one year were $ 8.8 billion. Contingencies The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully resolved. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. When a loss related to a legal proceeding or claim is probable and reasonably estimable, the Company accrues its best estimate for the ultimate resolution of the matter. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims, except for the following matters: VirnetX VirnetX, Inc. (“VirnetX”) filed a lawsuit against the Company alleging that certain of the Company’s products infringe on patents owned by VirnetX. On April 11, 2018, a jury returned a verdict against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas (the “Eastern Texas District Court”). The Company appealed the verdict to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which remanded the case back to the Eastern Texas District Court, where a re-trial was held in October 2020. The jury returned a verdict against the Company and awarded damages of $ 503 million, which the Company has appealed. The Company has challenged the validity of the patents at issue in the re-trial at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the “PTO”), and the PTO has declared the patents invalid, subject to further appeal by VirnetX. iOS Performance Management Cases On April 5, 2018, several U.S. federal actions alleging violation of consumer protection laws, fraud, computer intrusion and other causes of action related to the Company’s performance management feature used in its iPhone operating systems, introduced to certain iPhones in iOS updates 10.2.1 and 11.2, were consolidated through a Multidistrict Litigation process into a single action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the “Northern California District Court”). On February 28, 2020, the parties in the Multidistrict Litigation reached a settlement to resolve the U.S. federal and California state class actions. On March 18, 2021, the Northern California District Court granted final approval of the Multidistrict Litigation settlement, which will result in an aggregate payment of $ 310 million to settle all claims. The Company continues to believe that its iPhones were not defective, that the performance management feature introduced with iOS updates 10.2.1 and 11.2 was intended to, and did, improve customers’ user experience, and that the Company did not make any misleading statements or fail to disclose any material information. French Competition Authority On March 16, 2020, the French Competition Authority (“FCA”) announced its decision that aspects of the Company’s sales and distribution practices in France violate French competition law and issued a fine of € 1.1 billion. The Company strongly disagrees with the FCA’s decision and has appealed. Apple Inc. | Q3 2021 Form 10-Q | 20 Optis Optis Wireless Technology, LLC and related entities (“Optis”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas against the Company alleging that certain of the Company’s products infringe on patents owned by Optis. On August 11, 2020, a jury returned a verdict against the Company and awarded damages of $ 506 million. In post-trial proceedings, the damages portion of the verdict was set aside, and a retrial was scheduled for August 2021. The case remains pending further proceedings. Note 11 – Segment Information and Geographic Data The Company reports segment information based on the “management” approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company’s reportable segments. The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described in Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of the 2020 Form 10-K. The Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company’s retail stores located in those geographic locations. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the reportable segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as research and development, corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges and other separately managed general and administrative costs. The Company does not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes. The following table shows information by reportable segment for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 26, 2021 and June 27, 2020 (in millions): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended June 26, 2021 June 27, 2020 June 26, 2021 June 27, 2020 Americas: Net sales $ 35,870 $ 27,018 $ 116,486 $ 93,858 Operating income $ 12,916 $ 7,974 $ 40,751 $ 28,327 Europe: Net sales $ 18,943 $ 14,173 $ 68,513 $ 51,740 Operating income $ 7,085 $ 4,420 $ 24,939 $ 16,667 Greater China: Net sales $ 14,762 $ 9,329 $ 53,803 $ 32,362 Operating income $ 6,303 $ 3,414 $ 22,591 $ 12,535 Japan: Net sales $ 6,464 $ 4,966 $ 22,491 $ 16,395 Operating income $ 3,031 $ 2,114 $ 9,962 $ 7,128 Rest of Asia Pacific: Net sales $ 5,395 $ 4,199 $ 21,164 $ 15,462 Operating income $ 2,116 $ 1,374 $ 7,805 $ 5,395 Apple Inc. | Q3 2021 Form 10-Q | 21 A reconciliation of the Company’s segment operating income to the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 26, 2021 and June 27, 2020 is as follows (in millions): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended June 26, 2021 June 27, 2020 June 26, 2021 June 27, 2020 Segment operating income $ 31,451 $ 19,296 $ 106,048 $ 70,052 Research and development expense ( 5,717 ) ( 4,758 ) ( 16,142 ) ( 13,774 ) Other corporate expenses, net ( 1,608 ) ( 1,447 ) ( 4,743 ) ( 4,765 ) Total operating income $ 24,126 $ 13,091 $ 85,163 $ 51,513 Apple Inc. | Q3 2021 Form 10-Q | 22 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This section and other parts of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“Form 10-Q”) contain forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example, statements in this Form 10-Q regarding the potential future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s business and results of operations are forward-looking statements . Forward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as “future,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “predicts,” “will,” “would,” “could,” “can,” “may,” and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company’s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 26, 2020 (the “2020 Form 10-K”) under the heading “Risk Factors.” The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law. Unless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Company’s fiscal calendar, and references to particular years, quarters, months or periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Each of the terms the “Company” and “Apple” as used herein refers collectively to Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, unless otherwise stated. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the 2020 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. Available Information The Company periodically provides certain information for investors on its corporate website, www.apple.com, and its investor relations website, investor.apple.com. This includes press releases and other information about financial performance, information on corporate governance and details related to the Company’s annual meeting of shareholders. The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form 10-Q is not incorporated by reference into this filing. Further, the Company’s references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only. Quarterly Highlights Business Seasonality and Product Introductions The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction. COVID-19 Update The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted governments and businesses to take unprecedented measures, such as restrictions on travel and business operations, temporary closures of businesses, and quarantines and shelter-in-place orders. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets. The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have affected and could in the future materially impact the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. During the third quarter of 2021, aspects of the Company’s business continued to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with many of the Company’s retail stores, as well as channel partner points of sale, temporarily closed at various times, and a significant number of the Company’s employees working remotely. The Company has reopened substantially all of its offices and retail stores, subject to operating restrictions to protect public health and the health and safety of employees and customers, and it continues to work on safely reopening the remainder of its offices and retail stores, subject to local rules and regulations. The extent of the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s operational and financial performance is uncertain and will depend on many factors outside the Company’s control, including, without limitation, the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic; the availability, distribution and effectiveness of vaccines; the imposition of protective public safety measures; and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products. Refer to Part I, Item 1A of the 2020 Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors,” for more information. Apple Inc. | Q3 2021 Form 10-Q | 23 The Company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, along with commercial paper and other short-term liquidity arrangements, will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital asset purchases, dividends, share repurchases, debt repayments and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations. Third Quarter Fiscal 2021 Highlights Total net sales increased 36% or $21.7 billion during the third quarter of 2021 compared to the same quarter in 2020, driven by growth in all Products and Services categories.

Segment Operating Performance The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan.

Services Gross Margin Services gross margin increased during the third quarter and first nine months of 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020 due primarily to higher Services net sales, a different Services mix and the strength in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Year-over-year Services gross margin percentage increased during the third quarter and first nine months of 2021 due primarily to a different Services mix and improved leverage, partially offset by higher Services costs. The Company’s future gross margins can be impacted by a variety of factors, as discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the 2020 Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.” As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and downward pressure.

Year-over-year R&D expense increased during the first nine months of 2021 due primarily to higher headcount-related expenses and R&D-related professional services. The Company continues to believe that focused investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace, and to the development of new and updated products and services that are central to the Company’s core business strategy. Selling, General and Administrative The growth in selling, general and administrative expense during the third quarter of 2021 compared to the third quarter of 2020 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related and advertising expenses.

Other Income/(Expense), Net Other income/(expense), net (“OI&E”) for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 26, 2021 and June 27, 2020 was as follows (dollars in millions): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended June 26, 2021 June 27, 2020 Change June 26, 2021 June 27, 2020 Change Interest and dividend income $ 719 $ 901 $ 2,184 $ 2,995 Interest expense (665) (697) (1,973) (2,239) Other income/(expense), net 189 (158) 585 (79) Total other income/(expense), net $ 243 $ 46 428 % $ 796 $ 677 18 % OI&E increased during the third quarter of 2021 compared to the third quarter of 2020 due primarily to a favorable carrying value adjustment of non-marketable securities and smaller impairments of securities, partially offset by lower interest income. Year-over-year OI&E increased during the first nine months of 2021 due primarily to smaller impairments of securities, lower interest expense and favorable carrying value adjustments of non-marketable securities, partially offset by lower interest income. The weighted-average interest rate earned by the Company on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was 1.32% and 1.74% in the third quarter of 2021 and 2020, respectively, and 1.40% and 1.95% in the first nine months of 2021 and 2020, respectively.

The Company’s effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2021 was lower compared to the third quarter of 2020 due primarily to the favorable impact of changes in unrecognized tax benefits, a higher mix of foreign earnings, and higher tax benefits from share-based compensation. The Company’s effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2021 was lower compared to the same period in 2020 due primarily to higher tax benefits from share-based compensation, the favorable impact of changes in unrecognized tax benefits, and a higher mix of foreign earnings, partially offset by a one-time adjustment in 2020 of U.S. foreign tax credits in response to regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in December 2019. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following tables present selected financial information and statistics as of June 26, 2021 and September 26, 2020 and for the first nine months of 2021 and 2020 (in millions): June 26, 2021 September 26, 2020 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities (1) $ 193,644 $ 191,830 Property, plant and equipment, net $ 38,615 $ 36,766 Commercial paper $ 8,000 $ 4,996 Total term debt $ 113,791 $ 107,440 Working capital $ 6,669 $ 38,321 Nine Months Ended June 26, 2021 June 27, 2020 Cash generated by operating activities $ 83,838 $ 60,098 Cash used in investing activities $ (15,380) $ (9,820) Cash used in financing activities $ (72,971) $ (65,463) (1) As of June 26, 2021 and September 26, 2020, total marketable securities included $18.9 billion and $18.6 billion, respectively, that was restricted from general use, related to the State Aid Decision (refer to Note 5, “Income Taxes” in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q) and other agreements.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates, and such differences may be material.

Apple Inc. | Q2 2021 Form 10-Q | 5 Apple Inc. Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation and Preparation The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively “Apple” or the “Company”). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. In the opinion of the Company’s management, the condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation. These condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the Company’s annual consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 26, 2020 (the “2020 Form 10-K”). The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. The Company’s fiscal years 2021 and 2020 span 52 weeks each. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Common Stock Split On August 28, 2020, the Company effected a four -for-one stock split to shareholders of record as of August 24, 2020. All share, restricted stock unit (“RSU”) and per share or per RSU information has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Financial Instruments – Credit Losses At the beginning of the first quarter of 2021, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“ASU 2016-13”), which modifies the measurement of expected credit losses on certain financial instruments. The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 did not have a material impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements. Earnings Per Share The following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the three- and six-month periods ended March 27, 2021 and March 28, 2020 (net income in millions and shares in thousands): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended March 27, 2021 March 28, 2020 March 27, 2021 March 28, 2020 Numerator: Net income $ 23,630 $ 11,249 $ 52,385 $ 33,485 Denominator: Weighted-average basic shares outstanding 16,753,476 17,440,402 16,844,298 17,550,281 Effect of dilutive securities 175,681 178,363 177,125 168,310 Weighted-average diluted shares 16,929,157 17,618,765 17,021,423 17,718,591 Basic earnings per share $ 1.41 $ 0.64 $ 3.11 $ 1.91 Diluted earnings per share $ 1.40 $ 0.64 $ 3.08 $ 1.89 Apple Inc. | Q2 2021 Form 10-Q | 6 Note 2 – Revenue Recognition Net sales consist of revenue from the sale of iPhone ® , Mac ® , iPad ® , Services and other products. The Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is transferred to its customers. Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company’s Products net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company’s Services net sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable. The Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer incentive programs based on the Company’s expectations and historical experience. For arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the Company allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (“SSPs”). When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are established that reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company’s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation. The Company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud ® , Siri ® and Maps. The third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company’s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided. Cost of sales related to delivered hardware and bundled software, including estimated warranty costs, are recognized at the time of sale. Costs incurred to provide product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights are recognized as cost of sales as incurred. For certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For these arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized revenue, and has elected not to disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services. For the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products including, but not limited to, evaluating if it can establish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party applications sold through the App Store ® and certain digital content sold through the Company’s other digital content stores, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for such sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission it retains. The Company has elected to record revenue net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities, with the collected taxes recorded within other current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority. Deferred Revenue As of March 27, 2021 and September 26, 2020, the Company had total deferred revenue of $ 11.9 billion and $ 10.2 billion, respectively. As of March 27, 2021, the Company expects 64 % of total deferred revenue to be realized in less than a year, 26 % within one-to-two years, 8 % within two-to-three years and 2 % in greater than three years. Apple Inc. | Q2 2021 Form 10-Q | 7 Disaggregated Revenue Net sales disaggregated by significant products and services for the three- and six-month periods ended March 27, 2021 and March 28, 2020 were as follows (in millions): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended March 27, 2021 March 28, 2020 March 27, 2021 March 28, 2020 iPhone (1) $ 47,938 $ 28,962 $ 113,535 $ 84,919 Mac (1) 9,102 5,351 17,777 12,511 iPad (1) 7,807 4,368 16,242 10,345 Wearables, Home and Accessories (1)(2) 7,836 6,284 20,807 16,294 Services (3) 16,901 13,348 32,662 26,063 Total net sales (4) $ 89,584 $ 58,313 $ 201,023 $ 150,132 (1) Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are bundled in the sales price of the respective product.

(3) Services net sales include sales from the Company’s advertising, AppleCare ® , digital content and other services. Services net sales also include amortization of the deferred value of Maps, Siri, and free iCloud storage and Apple TV+ SM services, which are bundled in the sales price of certain products. (4) Includes $ 2.7 billion of revenue recognized in the three months ended March 27, 2021 that was included in deferred revenue as of December 26, 2020, $ 1.9 billion of revenue recognized in the three months ended March 28, 2020 that was included in deferred revenue as of December 28, 2019, $ 4.1 billion of revenue recognized in the six months ended March 27, 2021 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 26, 2020, and $ 3.0 billion of revenue recognized in the six months ended March 28, 2020 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 28, 2019. The Company’s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable segment in Note 11, “Segment Information and Geographic Data” for the three- and six-month periods ended March 27, 2021 and March 28, 2020.

(3) As of March 27, 2021 and September 26, 2020, total marketable securities included $ 19.0 billion and $ 18.6 billion, respectively, that was restricted from general use, related to the State Aid Decision (refer to Note 5, “Income Taxes”) and other agreements. Apple Inc. | Q2 2021 Form 10-Q | 9 The Company may sell certain of its marketable debt securities prior to their stated maturities for reasons including, but not limited to, managing liquidity, credit risk, duration and asset allocation. The following table shows the fair value of the Company’s non-current marketable debt securities, by contractual maturity, as of March 27, 2021 (in millions): Due after 1 year through 5 years $ 83,364 Due after 5 years through 10 years 28,835 Due after 10 years 22,340 Total fair value $ 134,539 The Company typically invests in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company’s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. Fair values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. Non-Marketable Securities The Company holds non-marketable equity securities of certain privately held companies without readily determinable fair values. As of March 27, 2021 and September 26, 2020, the Company’s non-marketable equity securities had a carrying value of $ 2.7 billion and $ 2.8 billion, respectively. Restricted Cash A reconciliation of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets to cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as of March 27, 2021 and September 26, 2020 is as follows (in millions): March 27, 2021 September 26, 2020 Cash and cash equivalents $ 38,466 $ 38,016 Restricted cash 1,540 1,773 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 40,006 $ 39,789 The Company’s restricted cash primarily consisted of cash to support the Company’s iPhone Upgrade Program. Substantially all of the Company’s restricted cash was included in other non-current assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Derivative Financial Instruments The Company may use derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risk on expected future cash flows, net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries, and certain existing assets and liabilities. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign currency exchange or interest rates. To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar may hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue, and subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar may hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries’ functional currencies. The Company may enter into forward contracts, option contracts or other instruments to manage this risk and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months. To protect the net investment in a foreign operation from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset a portion of the changes in the carrying amounts of these investments due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, the Company may use non-derivative financial instruments, such as its foreign currency–denominated debt, as hedges of its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries. In both of these cases, the Company designates these instruments as net investment hedges. To protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. These instruments may offset a portion of the foreign currency remeasurement gains or losses, or changes in fair value. The Company may designate these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of March 27, 2021, the Company’s hedged term debt– and marketable securities–related foreign currency transactions are expected to be recognized within 21 years. Apple Inc. | Q2 2021 Form 10-Q | 10 The Company may also enter into non-designated foreign currency contracts to offset a portion of the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. To protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. These instruments may offset a portion of the changes in interest income or expense, or changes in fair value. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of March 27, 2021, the Company’s hedged interest rate transactions are expected to be recognized within seven years . Cash Flow Hedges Cash flow hedge amounts that are included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (“AOCI”) until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of foreign currency revenue are recognized as a component of net sales in the same period as the related revenue is recognized, and deferred gains and losses related to cash flow hedges of inventory purchases are recognized as a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related costs are recognized. Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of interest income or expense are recognized in other income/(expense), net (“OI&E”) in the same period as the related income or expense is recognized. For options designated as cash flow hedges, the time value is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognized in the financial statement line item to which the hedge relates on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in other comprehensive income/(loss) (“OCI”). Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially identified time period or within a subsequent two-month time period. Deferred gains and losses in AOCI associated with such derivative instruments are reclassified into OI&E in the period of de-designation. Any subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are reflected in OI&E unless they are re-designated as hedges of other transactions. Net Investment Hedges Net investment hedge amounts that are included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recorded in OCI as a part of the cumulative translation adjustment. For foreign exchange forward contracts designated as net investment hedges, the forward carry component is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognized in OCI on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OCI. Fair Value Hedges Fair value hedge gains and losses related to amounts that are included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in earnings along with a corresponding loss or gain related to the change in value of the hedged item in the same line in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. For foreign exchange forward contracts designated as fair value hedges, the forward carry component is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognized in OI&E on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge. Amounts excluded from the effectiveness assessment of fair value hedges and recognized in OI&E were gains of $ 60 million and $ 142 million for the three- and six-month periods ended March 27, 2021, respectively, and were gains of $ 126 million and $ 254 million for the three- and six-month periods ended March 28, 2020, respectively. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OCI. Non-Designated Derivatives Derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are adjusted to fair value through earnings in the financial statement line item to which the derivative relates. Apple Inc. | Q2 2021 Form 10-Q | 11 The Company records all derivatives in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The Company’s accounting treatment for these derivative instruments is based on its hedge designation. The following tables show the Company’s derivative instruments at gross fair value as of March 27, 2021 and September 26, 2020 (in millions): March 27, 2021 Fair Value of Derivatives Designated as Hedge Instruments Fair Value of Derivatives Not Designated as Hedge Instruments Total Fair Value Derivative assets (1) : Foreign exchange contracts $ 717 $ 778 $ 1,495 Interest rate contracts $ 923 $ — $ 923 Derivative liabilities (2) : Foreign exchange contracts $ 1,014 $ 702 $ 1,716 September 26, 2020 Fair Value of Derivatives Designated as Hedge Instruments Fair Value of Derivatives Not Designated as Hedge Instruments Total Fair Value Derivative assets (1) : Foreign exchange contracts $ 749 $ 303 $ 1,052 Interest rate contracts $ 1,557 $ — $ 1,557 Derivative liabilities (2) : Foreign exchange contracts $ 1,561 $ 485 $ 2,046 (1) The fair value of derivative assets is measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and is included in other current assets and other non-current assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. (2) The fair value of derivative liabilities is measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and is included in other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company classifies cash flows related to derivative financial instruments as operating activities in its Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The following table shows the pre-tax gains and losses of the Company’s derivative and non-derivative instruments designated as cash flow and net investment hedges in OCI and the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three- and six-month periods ended March 27, 2021 and March 28, 2020 (in millions): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended March 27, 2021 March 28, 2020 March 27, 2021 March 28, 2020 Gains/(Losses) recognized in OCI – included in effectiveness assessment: Cash flow hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ 338 $ ( 462 ) $ 147 $ ( 191 ) Interest rate contracts 39 ( 66 ) 93 ( 66 ) Total $ 377 $ ( 528 ) $ 240 $ ( 257 ) Net investment hedges: Foreign currency debt $ — $ 11 $ — $ 35 Gains/(Losses) reclassified from AOCI into net income – included in effectiveness assessment: Cash flow hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ ( 885 ) $ ( 817 ) $ ( 571 ) $ ( 326 ) Interest rate contracts ( 2 ) ( 1 ) ( 5 ) ( 3 ) Total $ ( 887 ) $ ( 818 ) $ ( 576 ) $ ( 329 ) Apple Inc. | Q2 2021 Form 10-Q | 12 Amounts excluded from the effectiveness assessment of the Company’s hedges and recognized in OCI were a gain of $ 41 million and a loss of $ 97 million for the three- and six-month periods ended March 27, 2021, respectively, and were gains of $ 258 million and $ 169 million for the three- and six-month periods ended March 28, 2020, respectively. The following tables show information about the Company’s derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges and the related hedged items for the three- and six-month periods ended March 27, 2021 and March 28, 2020 and as of March 27, 2021 and September 26, 2020 (in millions): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended March 27, 2021 March 28, 2020 March 27, 2021 March 28, 2020 Gains/(Losses) on derivative instruments (1) : Foreign exchange contracts $ 570 $ 436 $ ( 183 ) $ 253 Interest rate contracts ( 451 ) 1,290 ( 618 ) 1,128 Total $ 119 $ 1,726 $ ( 801 ) $ 1,381 Gains/(Losses) related to hedged items (1) : Marketable securities $ ( 569 ) $ ( 436 ) $ 183 $ ( 253 ) Fixed-rate debt 451 ( 1,290 ) 618 ( 1,128 ) Total $ ( 118 ) $ ( 1,726 ) $ 801 $ ( 1,381 ) March 27, 2021 September 26, 2020 Carrying amounts of hedged assets/(liabilities): Marketable securities (2) $ 16,423 $ 16,270 Fixed-rate debt (3) $ ( 18,416 ) $ ( 21,033 ) Cumulative hedging adjustments included in the carrying amounts of hedged items: Marketable securities carrying amount increases/(decreases) $ 403 $ 493 Fixed-rate debt carrying amount (increases)/decreases $ ( 923 ) $ ( 1,541 ) (1) Gains and losses related to fair value hedges are included in OI&E in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. (2) The carrying amounts of marketable securities that are designated as hedged items in fair value hedges are included in current marketable securities and non-current marketable securities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets (3) The carrying amounts of fixed-rate debt instruments that are designated as hedged items in fair value hedges are included in current term debt and non-current term debt in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The following table shows the notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments and credit risk amounts associated with outstanding or unsettled derivative instruments as of March 27, 2021 and September 26, 2020 (in millions): March 27, 2021 September 26, 2020 Notional Amount Credit Risk Amount Notional Amount Credit Risk Amount Instruments designated as accounting hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ 53,312 $ 717 $ 57,410 $ 749 Interest rate contracts $ 17,500 $ 923 $ 20,700 $ 1,557 Instruments not designated as accounting hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ 104,434 $ 778 $ 88,636 $ 303 Apple Inc. | Q2 2021 Form 10-Q | 13 The notional amounts for outstanding derivative instruments provide one measure of the transaction volume outstanding and do not represent the amount of the Company’s exposure to credit or market loss. The credit risk amounts represent the Company’s gross exposure to potential accounting loss on derivative instruments that are outstanding or unsettled if all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current currency or interest rates at each respective date. The Company’s exposure to credit loss and market risk will vary over time as currency and interest rates change. Although the table above reflects the notional and credit risk amounts of the Company’s derivative instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses associated with the exposures and transactions that the instruments are intended to hedge. The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments. The Company generally enters into master netting arrangements, which are designed to reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. The Company presents its derivative assets and derivative liabilities at their gross fair values in its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of March 27, 2021 and September 26, 2020, the net cash collateral received by the Company related to derivative instruments under its collateral security arrangements was $ 935 million and $ 875 million, respectively. The Company includes gross collateral posted and received in other current assets and other current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, respectively. Under master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to the Company’s derivative contracts, the Company is allowed to net settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of March 27, 2021 and September 26, 2020, the potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the Company’s derivative contracts, including the effects of collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $ 2.4 billion and $ 2.8 billion, respectively, resulting in net derivative liabilities of $ 233 million and $ 312 million, respectively. Accounts Receivable Trade Receivables The Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, resellers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral or third-party credit support in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements. As of March 27, 2021, the Company had one customer that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, which accounted for 13 %. As of September 26, 2020, the Company had no customers that individually represented 10% or more of total trade receivables. The Company’s cellular network carriers accounted for 35 % of total trade receivables as of March 27, 2021. Vendor Non-Trade Receivables The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. As of March 27, 2021, the Company had one vendor that represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 65 %. As of September 26, 2020, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 57 %, and 11 %. Apple Inc. | Q2 2021 Form 10-Q | 14 Note 4 – Condensed Consolidated Financial Statement Details The following tables show the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statement details as of March 27, 2021 and September 26, 2020 (in millions): Property, Plant and Equipment, Net March 27, 2021 September 26, 2020 Land and buildings $ 19,000 $ 17,952 Machinery, equipment and internal-use software 77,841 75,291 Leasehold improvements 10,439 10,283 Gross property, plant and equipment 107,280 103,526 Accumulated depreciation and amortization ( 69,465 ) ( 66,760 ) Total property, plant and equipment, net $ 37,815 $ 36,766 Other Non-Current Liabilities March 27, 2021 September 26, 2020 Long-term taxes payable $ 25,162 $ 28,170 Other non-current liabilities 27,791 26,320 Total other non-current liabilities $ 52,953 $ 54,490 Other Income/(Expense), Net The following table shows the detail of OI&E for the three- and six-month periods ended March 27, 2021 and March 28, 2020 (in millions): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended March 27, 2021 March 28, 2020 March 27, 2021 March 28, 2020 Interest and dividend income $ 718 $ 1,049 $ 1,465 $ 2,094 Interest expense ( 670 ) ( 757 ) ( 1,308 ) ( 1,542 ) Other income/(expense), net 460 ( 10 ) 396 79 Total other income/(expense), net $ 508 $ 282 $ 553 $ 631 Note 5 – Income Taxes Uncertain Tax Positions As of March 27, 2021, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $ 16.9 billion, of which $ 8.3 billion, if recognized, would impact the Company’s effective tax rate. The Company had accrued $ 1.6 billion of gross interest and penalties related to income tax matters as of March 27, 2021. The Company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and many state and foreign jurisd ictions. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service concluded its review of the years 2013 through 2015 in 2018, and all years before 2016 are closed. Tax years after 2014 remain open in certain major foreign jurisdictions and are subject to examination by the taxing authorities. The Company believes that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Company’s tax audits are resolved in a manner inconsistent with its expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs. Although the timing of resolution and/or closure of audits is not certain, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that its gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease in the next 12 months by as much as $ 3.1 billion. Apple Inc. | Q2 2021 Form 10-Q | 15 European Commission State Aid Decision On August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company (the “State Aid Decision”). The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The recovery amount was calculated to be € 13.1 billion, plus interest of € 1.2 billion. The Company and Ireland appealed the State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the “General Court”). On July 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September 25, 2020, the European Commission appealed the General Court’s decision to the European Court of Justice. The Company believes that any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision would be creditable against U.S. taxes, subject to any foreign tax credit limitations in the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. On an annual basis, the Company may request approval from the Irish Minister for Finance to reduce the recovery amount for certain taxes paid to other countries. As of March 27, 2021, the adjusted recovery amount was € 12.9 billion, excluding interest. The adjusted recovery amount plus interest is funded into escrow, where it will remain restricted from general use pending the conclusion of all legal proceedings. Refer to the Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities section of Note 3, “Financial Instruments” for more information. Note 6 – Debt Commercial Paper and Repurchase Agreement The Company issues unsecured short-term promissory notes (“Commercial Paper”) pursuant to a commercial paper program. The Company uses net proceeds from the commercial paper program for general corporate purposes, including dividends and share repurchases. As of both March 27, 2021 and September 26, 2020, the Company had $ 5.0 billion of Commercial Paper outstanding, with maturities generally less than nine months . The weighted-average interest rate of the Company’s Commercial Paper was 0.06 % and 0.62 % as of March 27, 2021 and September 26, 2020, respectively. The following table provides a summary of cash flows associated with the issuance and maturities of Commercial Paper for the six months ended March 27, 2021 and March 28, 2020 (in millions): Six Months Ended March 27, 2021 March 28, 2020 Maturities 90 days or less: Proceeds from commercial paper, net $ 2,008 $ 1,377 Maturities greater than 90 days: Proceeds from commercial paper 1,368 4,797 Repayments of commercial paper ( 3,354 ) ( 4,656 ) Proceeds from/(Repayments of) commercial paper, net ( 1,986 ) 141 Total proceeds from commercial paper, net $ 22 $ 1,518 In the second quarter of 2020, the Company entered into an agreement to sell certain of its marketable securities with a promise to repurchase the securities at a specified time and amount (“Repo”). Due to the Company’s continuing involvement with the marketable securities, the Company accounted for the Repo as a collateralized borrowing. As of September 26, 2020, the Repo had been settled. Apple Inc. | Q2 2021 Form 10-Q | 16 Term Debt As of March 27, 2021, the Company had outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $ 116.0 billion (collectively the “Notes”). The Notes are senior unsecured obligations and interest is payable in arrears. The following table provides a summary of the Company’s term debt as of March 27, 2021 and September 26, 2020: Maturities (calendar year) March 27, 2021 September 26, 2020 Amount (in millions) Effective Interest Rate Amount (in millions) Effective Interest Rate 2013 – 2020 debt issuances: Floating-rate notes 2022 $ 1,750 0.55 % – 0.69 % $ 2,250 0.60 % – 1.39 % Fixed-rate 0.000 % – 4.650 % notes 2021 – 2060 100,255 0.03 % – 4.78 % 103,828 0.03 % – 4.78 % 2021 debt issuance: Fixed-rate 0.700 % – 2.800 % notes 2026 – 2061 14,000 0.75 % – 2.81 % — — % Total term debt 116,005 106,078 Unamortized premium/(discount) and issuance costs, net ( 371 ) ( 314 ) Hedge accounting fair value adjustments 1,011 1,676 Less: Current portion of term debt ( 8,003 ) ( 8,773 ) Total non-current portion of term debt $ 108,642 $ 98,667 To manage interest rate risk on certain of its U.S. dollar–denominated fixed- or floating-rate notes, the Company has entered into interest rate swaps to effectively convert the fixed interest rates to floating interest rates or the floating interest rates to fixed interest rates on a portion of these notes. Additionally, to manage foreign currency risk on certain of its foreign currency–denominated notes, the Company has entered into foreign currency swaps to effectively convert these notes to U.S. dollar–denominated notes. The effective interest rates for the Notes include the interest on the Notes, amortization of the discount or premium and, if applicable, adjustments related to hedging. The Company recognized $ 657 million and $ 1.3 billion of interest cost on its term debt for the three- and six-month periods ended March 27, 2021, respectively. The Company recognized $ 725 million and $ 1.5 billion of interest cost on its term debt for the three- and six-month periods ended March 28, 2020, respectively. As of March 27, 2021 and September 26, 2020, the fair value of the Company’s Notes, based on Level 2 inputs, was $ 121.2 billion and $ 117.1 billion, respectively. Note 7 – Shareholders’ Equity Share Repurchase Program As of March 27, 2021, the Company was authorized to purchase up to $ 225 billion of the Company’s common stock under a share repurchase program (the “Program”). During the six months ended March 27, 2021, the Company repurchased 347 million shares of its common stock for $ 43.0 billion, bringing the total utilization under the Program to $ 211.6 billion. On April 28, 2021, the Company announced the Board of Directors increased the Program authorization by $ 90 billion. The Program does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares. Under the Program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Apple Inc. | Q2 2021 Form 10-Q | 17 Note 8 – Comprehensive Income The Company’s OCI consists of foreign currency translation adjustments from those subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, net deferred gains and losses on certain derivative instruments accounted for as hedges, and unrealized gains and losses on marketable debt securities classified as available-for-sale. The following table shows the pre-tax amounts reclassified from AOCI into the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, and the associated financial statement line items, for the three- and six-month periods ended March 27, 2021 and March 28, 2020 (in millions): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended Comprehensive Income Components Financial Statement Line Items March 27, 2021 March 28, 2020 March 27, 2021 March 28, 2020 Unrealized (gains)/losses on derivative instruments: Foreign exchange contracts Total net sales $ 314 $ 34 $ 418 $ ( 63 ) Total cost of sales 406 12 651 ( 159 ) Other income/(expense), net 193 771 ( 435 ) 548 Interest rate contracts Other income/(expense), net 2 1 5 3 915 818 639 329 Unrealized (gains)/losses on marketable debt securities Other income/(expense), net ( 96 ) 37 ( 214 ) 24 Total amounts reclassified from AOCI $ 819 $ 855 $ 425 $ 353 The following table shows the changes in AOCI by component for the six months ended March 27, 2021 (in millions): Cumulative Foreign Currency Translation Unrealized Gains/Losses on Derivative Instruments Unrealized Gains/Losses on Marketable Debt Securities Total Balances as of September 26, 2020 $ ( 1,375 ) $ ( 877 ) $ 1,846 $ ( 406 ) Other comprehensive income/(loss) before reclassifications 471 111 ( 1,067 ) ( 485 ) Amounts reclassified from AOCI — 639 ( 214 ) 425 Tax effect — ( 146 ) 326 180 Other comprehensive income/(loss) 471 604 ( 955 ) 120 Balances as of March 27, 2021 $ ( 904 ) $ ( 273 ) $ 891 $ ( 286 ) Note 9 – Benefit Plans Stock Plans The Company had 718 million shares reserved for future issuance under its stock plans as of March 27, 2021. RSUs granted under the Company’s stock plans generally vest over four years , based on continued employment, and are settled upon vesting in shares of the Company’s common stock on a one -for-one basis. RSUs granted under the Company’s stock plans reduce the number of shares available for grant under the plans by a factor of two times the number of RSUs granted. RSUs canceled and shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations increase the number of shares available for grant under the plans utilizing a factor of two times the number of RSUs canceled or shares withheld. Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans During the three months ended March 27, 2021, Section 16 officers Katherine L. Adams, Timothy D. Cook, Chris Kondo, Luca Maestri, Deirdre O’Brien and Jeffrey Williams had equity trading plans in place in accordance with Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) under the Exchange Act. An equity trading plan is a written document that pre-establishes the amounts, prices and dates (or formula for determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of the Company’s stock, including shares acquired under the Company’s employee and director equity plans. Apple Inc. | Q2 2021 Form 10-Q | 18 Restricted Stock Units A summary of the Company’s RSU activity and related information for the six months ended March 27, 2021 is as follows: Number of RSUs (in thousands) Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value Per RSU Aggregate Fair Value (in millions) Balance as of September 26, 2020 310,778 $ 51.58 RSUs granted 79,068 $ 113.39 RSUs vested ( 75,295 ) $ 45.83 RSUs canceled ( 5,918 ) $ 63.67 Balance as of March 27, 2021 308,633 $ 68.58 $ 37,409 The fair value as of the respective vesting dates of RSUs was $ 867 million and $ 9.4 billion for the three- and six-month periods ended March 27, 2021, respectively, and was $ 558 million and $ 4.8 billion for the three- and six-month periods ended March 28, 2020, respectively. Share-Based Compensation The following table shows share-based compensation expense and the related income tax benefit included in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three- and six-month periods ended March 27, 2021 and March 28, 2020 (in millions): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended March 27, 2021 March 28, 2020 March 27, 2021 March 28, 2020 Share-based compensation expense $ 1,981 $ 1,697 $ 4,001 $ 3,407 Income tax benefit related to share-based compensation expense $ ( 575 ) $ ( 444 ) $ ( 2,199 ) $ ( 1,202 ) As of March 27, 2021, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding RSUs and stock options was $ 16.7 billion, which the Company expects to recognize over a weighted-average period of 2.8 years. Note 10 – Commitments and Contingencies Accrued Warranty and Guarantees The following table shows changes in the Company’s accrued warranties and related costs for the three- and six-month periods ended March 27, 2021 and March 28, 2020 (in millions): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended March 27, 2021 March 28, 2020 March 27, 2021 March 28, 2020 Beginning accrued warranty and related costs $ 4,124 $ 3,873 $ 3,354 $ 3,570 Cost of warranty claims ( 649 ) ( 689 ) ( 1,372 ) ( 1,604 ) Accruals for product warranty 309 739 1,802 1,957 Ending accrued warranty and related costs $ 3,784 $ 3,923 $ 3,784 $ 3,923 The Company offers an iPhone Upgrade Program, which is available to customers who purchase a qualifying iPhone in the U.S., the U.K. and China mainland. The iPhone Upgrade Program provides customers the right to trade in that iPhone for a specified amount when purchasing a new iPhone, provided certain conditions are met. The Company accounts for the trade-in right as a guarantee liability and recognizes arrangement revenue net of the fair value of such right, with subsequent changes to the guarantee liability recognized within net sales. Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product Although most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets and other electronic devices. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. Apple Inc. | Q2 2021 Form 10-Q | 19 The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements. The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Substantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia, with some Mac computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland. Unconditional Purchase Obligations The Company has entered into certain off–balance sheet commitments that require the future purchase of goods or services (“unconditional purchase obligations”). The Company’s unconditional purchase obligations primarily consist of payments for content creation, Internet and telecommunications services and supplier arrangements. As of March 27, 2021, the Company’s total future payments under noncancelable unconditional purchase obligations having a remaining term in excess of one year were $ 8.2 billion. Contingencies The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully resolved. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. When a loss related to a legal proceeding or claim is probable and reasonably estimable, the Company accrues its best estimate for the ultimate resolution of the matter. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims, except for the following matters: VirnetX VirnetX, Inc. (“VirnetX”) filed a lawsuit against the Company alleging that certain of the Company’s products infringe on patents owned by VirnetX. On April 11, 2018, a jury returned a verdict against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas (the “Eastern Texas District Court”). The Company appealed the verdict to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which remanded the case back to the Eastern Texas District Court, where a re-trial was held in October 2020. The jury returned a verdict against the Company and awarded damages of $ 503 million, which the Company has appealed. The Company has challenged the validity of the patents at issue in the re-trial at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the “PTO”), and the PTO has declared the patents invalid, subject to further appeal by VirnetX. iOS Performance Management Cases On April 5, 2018, several U.S. federal actions alleging violation of consumer protection laws, fraud, computer intrusion and other causes of action related to the Company’s performance management feature used in its iPhone operating systems, introduced to certain iPhones in iOS updates 10.2.1 and 11.2, were consolidated through a Multidistrict Litigation process into a single action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the “Northern California District Court”). On February 28, 2020, the parties in the Multidistrict Litigation reached a settlement to resolve the U.S. federal and California state class actions. On March 18, 2021, the Northern California District Court granted final approval of the Multidistrict Litigation settlement, which will result in an aggregate payment of $ 310 million to settle all claims. The Company continues to believe that its iPhones were not defective, that the performance management feature introduced with iOS updates 10.2.1 and 11.2 was intended to, and did, improve customers’ user experience, and that the Company did not make any misleading statements or fail to disclose any material information. French Competition Authority On March 16, 2020, the French Competition Authority (“FCA”) announced its decision that aspects of the Company’s sales and distribution practices in France violate French competition law and issued a fine of € 1.1 billion. The Company strongly disagrees with the FCA’s decision and has appealed. Apple Inc. | Q2 2021 Form 10-Q | 20 Optis Optis Wireless Technology, LLC and related entities (“Optis”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas against the Company alleging that certain of the Company’s products infringe on patents owned by Optis. On August 11, 2020, a jury returned a verdict against the Company and awarded damages of $ 506 million. In post-trial proceedings, the damages portion of the verdict was set aside, and the case remains pending further proceedings. Note 11 – Segment Information and Geographic Data The Company reports segment information based on the “management” approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company’s reportable segments. The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described in Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of the 2020 Form 10-K. The Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company’s retail stores located in those geographic locations. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the reportable segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as research and development, corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges and other separately managed general and administrative costs. The Company does not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This section and other parts of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“Form 10-Q”) contain forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example, statements in this Form 10-Q regarding the potential future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s business and results of operations are forward-looking statements . Forward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as “future,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “predicts,” “will,” “would,” “could,” “can,” “may,” and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company’s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 26, 2020 (the “2020 Form 10-K”) under the heading “Risk Factors.” The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law. Unless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Company’s fiscal calendar, and references to particular years, quarters, months or periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Each of the terms the “Company” and “Apple” as used herein refers collectively to Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, unless otherwise stated. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the 2020 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. Available Information The Company periodically provides certain information for investors on its corporate website, www.apple.com, and its investor relations website, investor.apple.com. This includes press releases and other information about financial performance, information on corporate governance and details related to the Company’s annual meeting of shareholders. The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form 10-Q is not incorporated by reference into this filing. Further, the Company’s references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only. Quarterly Highlights Business Seasonality and Product Introductions The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction. COVID-19 Update The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted governments and businesses to take unprecedented measures, such as restrictions on travel and business operations, temporary closures of businesses, and quarantines and shelter-in-place orders. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets. The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have affected and could in the future materially impact the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. During the second quarter of 2021, aspects of the Company’s business continued to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with many of the Company’s retail stores, as well as channel partner points of sale, temporarily closed at various times, and the vast majority of the Company’s employees working remotely. The Company has reopened some of its offices and retail stores, subject to operating restrictions to protect public health and the health and safety of employees and customers, and it continues to work on safely reopening the remainder of its offices and retail stores, subject to local rules and regulations. The full extent of the future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s operational and financial performance is currently uncertain and will depend on many factors outside the Company’s control, including, without limitation, the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic; the availability, distribution and effectiveness of vaccines; the imposition of protective public safety measures; and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products. Refer to Part I, Item 1A of the 2020 Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors,” for more information.

Second Quarter Fiscal 2021 Highlights Total net sales increased 54% or $31.3 billion during the second quarter of 2021 compared to the same quarter in 2020, driven by higher net sales in all Products and Services categories in each of the Company’s reportable segments.

Deemed Repatriation Tax Payable As of March 27, 2021, the balance of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”) was $27.8 billion, of which $25.1 billion was included in other non-current liabilities in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company pays the deemed repatriation tax payable in installments in accordance with the Act. Other Non-Current Liabilities The Company’s remaining other non-current liabilities primarily consist of items for which the Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing or amount of payments. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates, and such differences may be material. Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of the 2020 Form 10-K, and “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in Part II, Item 7 of the 2020 Form 10-K describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements. There have been no material changes to the Company’s critical accounting policies and estimates since the 2020 Form 10-K. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk There have been no material changes to the Company’s market risk during the first six months of 2021. For a discussion of the Company’s exposure to market risk, refer to the Company’s market risk disclosures set forth in Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” of the 2020 Form 10-K. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act were effective as of March 27, 2021 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the second quarter of 2021, which were identified in connection with management’s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Apple Inc. | Q2 2021 Form 10-Q | 30 PART II — OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings The Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The Company’s material legal proceedings are described in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, “Commitments and Contingencies” under the heading “Contingencies.” The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. The Company settled certain matters during the second quarter of 2021 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating results. Item 1A. Risk Factors The business, financial condition and operating results of the Company can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described in Part I, Item 1A of the 2020 Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors,” any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly, cause the Company’s actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from past, or from anticipated future, financial condition and operating results. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, operating results and stock price. There have been no material changes to the Company’s risk factors since the 2020 Form 10-K. Item 2.

Apple Inc. | Q1 2021 Form 10-Q | 5 Apple Inc. Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation and Preparation The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively “Apple” or the “Company”). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. In the opinion of the Company’s management, the condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation. These condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the Company’s annual consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 26, 2020 (the “2020 Form 10-K”). The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. The Company’s fiscal years 2021 and 2020 span 52 weeks each. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Common Stock Split On August 28, 2020, the Company effected a four -for-one stock split to shareholders of record as of August 24, 2020. All share, restricted stock unit (“RSU”) and per share or per RSU information has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Financial Instruments – Credit Losses At the beginning of the first quarter of 2021, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“ASU 2016-13”), which modifies the measurement of expected credit losses on certain financial instruments. The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 did not have a material impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements. Earnings Per Share The following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the three months ended December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019 (net income in millions and shares in thousands): Three Months Ended December 26, 2020 December 28, 2019 Numerator: Net income $ 28,755 $ 22,236 Denominator: Weighted-average basic shares outstanding 16,935,119 17,660,160 Effect of dilutive securities 178,569 158,257 Weighted-average diluted shares 17,113,688 17,818,417 Basic earnings per share $ 1.70 $ 1.26 Diluted earnings per share $ 1.68 $ 1.25 Apple Inc. | Q1 2021 Form 10-Q | 6 Note 2 – Revenue Recognition Net sales consist of revenue from the sale of iPhone ® , Mac ® , iPad ® , Services and other products.

Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company’s Products net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company’s Services net sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable. The Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer incentive programs based on the Company’s expectations and historical experience. For arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the Company allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (“SSPs”). When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are established that reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company’s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation. The Company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud ® , Siri ® and Maps. The third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company’s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided. Cost of sales related to delivered hardware and bundled software, including estimated warranty costs, are recognized at the time of sale. Costs incurred to provide product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights are recognized as cost of sales as incurred. For certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For these arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized revenue, and has elected not to disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services. For the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products including, but not limited to, evaluating if it can establish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party applications sold through the App Store ® and certain digital content sold through the Company’s other digital content stores, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for such sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission it retains. The Company has elected to record revenue net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities, with the collected taxes recorded within other current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority. Deferred Revenue As of December 26, 2020 and September 26, 2020, the Company had total deferred revenue of $ 11.6 billion and $ 10.2 billion, respectively. As of December 26, 2020, the Company expects 64 % of total deferred revenue to be realized in less than a year, 26 % within one-to-two years, 8 % within two-to-three years and 2 % in greater than three years. Apple Inc. | Q1 2021 Form 10-Q | 7 Disaggregated Revenue Net sales disaggregated by significant products and services for the three months ended December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019 were as follows (in millions): Three Months Ended December 26, 2020 December 28, 2019 iPhone (1) $ 65,597 $ 55,957 Mac (1) 8,675 7,160 iPad (1) 8,435 5,977 Wearables, Home and Accessories (1)(2) 12,971 10,010 Services (3) 15,761 12,715 Total net sales (4) $ 111,439 $ 91,819 (1) Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are bundled in the sales price of the respective product. (2) Wearables, Home and Accessories net sales include sales of AirPods ® , Apple TV ® , Apple Watch ® , Beats ® products, HomePod ® , iPod touch ® and Apple-branded and third-party accessories. (3) Services net sales include sales from the Company’s advertising, AppleCare ® , digital content and other services.

(3) As of December 26, 2020 and September 26, 2020, total marketable securities included $ 19.5 billion and $ 18.6 billion, respectively, that was restricted from general use, related to the State Aid Decision (refer to Note 5, “Income Taxes”) and other agreements. The Company may sell certain of its marketable debt securities prior to their stated maturities for reasons including, but not limited to, managing liquidity, credit risk, duration and asset allocation. The maturities of the Company’s non-current marketable debt securities generally range from one to five years . The Company typically invests in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company’s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. Fair values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. Non-Marketable Securities The Company holds non-marketable equity securities of certain privately held companies without readily determinable fair values. As of December 26, 2020 and September 26, 2020, the Company’s non-marketable equity securities had a carrying value of $ 2.5 billion and $ 2.8 billion, respectively. Restricted Cash A reconciliation of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets to cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as of December 26, 2020 and September 26, 2020 is as follows (in millions): December 26, 2020 September 26, 2020 Cash and cash equivalents $ 36,010 $ 38,016 Restricted cash 1,709 1,773 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 37,719 $ 39,789 The Company’s restricted cash primarily consisted of cash to support the Company’s iPhone Upgrade Program. Substantially all of the Company’s restricted cash was included in other non-current assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Apple Inc. | Q1 2021 Form 10-Q | 9 Derivative Financial Instruments The Company may use derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risk on expected future cash flows, net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries, and certain existing assets and liabilities. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign currency exchange or interest rates. To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar may hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue, and subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar may hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries’ functional currencies. The Company may enter into forward contracts, option contracts or other instruments to manage this risk and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months. To protect the net investment in a foreign operation from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset a portion of the changes in the carrying amounts of these investments due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, the Company may use non-derivative financial instruments, such as its foreign currency–denominated debt, as hedges of its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries. In both of these cases, the Company designates these instruments as net investment hedges. To protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. These instruments may offset a portion of the foreign currency remeasurement gains or losses, or changes in fair value. The Company may designate these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of December 26, 2020, the Company’s hedged term debt– and marketable securities–related foreign currency transactions are expected to be recognized within 22 years. The Company may also enter into non-designated foreign currency contracts to offset a portion of the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. To protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. These instruments may offset a portion of the changes in interest income or expense, or changes in fair value. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of December 26, 2020, the Company’s hedged interest rate transactions are expected to be recognized within seven years . Cash Flow Hedges Cash flow hedge amounts that are included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (“AOCI”) until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of foreign currency revenue are recognized as a component of net sales in the same period as the related revenue is recognized, and deferred gains and losses related to cash flow hedges of inventory purchases are recognized as a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related costs are recognized. Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of interest income or expense are recognized in other income/(expense), net (“OI&E”) in the same period as the related income or expense is recognized. For options designated as cash flow hedges, the time value is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognized in the financial statement line item to which the hedge relates on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in other comprehensive income/(loss) (“OCI”). Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially identified time period or within a subsequent two-month time period. Deferred gains and losses in AOCI associated with such derivative instruments are reclassified into OI&E in the period of de-designation. Any subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are reflected in OI&E unless they are re-designated as hedges of other transactions. Net Investment Hedges Net investment hedge amounts that are included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recorded in OCI as a part of the cumulative translation adjustment. For foreign exchange forward contracts designated as net investment hedges, the forward carry component is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognized in OCI on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OCI. Apple Inc. | Q1 2021 Form 10-Q | 10 Fair Value Hedges Fair value hedge gains and losses related to amounts that are included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in earnings along with a corresponding loss or gain related to the change in value of the hedged item in the same line in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. For foreign exchange forward contracts designated as fair value hedges, the forward carry component is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognized in OI&E on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge. Amounts excluded from the effectiveness assessment of fair value hedges and recognized in OI&E were gains of $ 82 million and $ 128 million for the three months ended December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, respectively. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OCI. Non-Designated Derivatives Derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are adjusted to fair value through earnings in the financial statement line item to which the derivative relates. The Company records all derivatives in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The Company’s accounting treatment for these derivative instruments is based on its hedge designation. The following tables show the Company’s derivative instruments at gross fair value as of December 26, 2020 and September 26, 2020 (in millions): December 26, 2020 Fair Value of Derivatives Designated as Hedge Instruments Fair Value of Derivatives Not Designated as Hedge Instruments Total Fair Value Derivative assets (1) : Foreign exchange contracts $ 524 $ 780 $ 1,304 Interest rate contracts $ 1,443 $ — $ 1,443 Derivative liabilities (2) : Foreign exchange contracts $ 2,332 $ 1,314 $ 3,646 September 26, 2020 Fair Value of Derivatives Designated as Hedge Instruments Fair Value of Derivatives Not Designated as Hedge Instruments Total Fair Value Derivative assets (1) : Foreign exchange contracts $ 749 $ 303 $ 1,052 Interest rate contracts $ 1,557 $ — $ 1,557 Derivative liabilities (2) : Foreign exchange contracts $ 1,561 $ 485 $ 2,046 (1) The fair value of derivative assets is measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and is included in other current assets and other non-current assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. (2) The fair value of derivative liabilities is measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and is included in other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company classifies cash flows related to derivative financial instruments as operating activities in its Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Apple Inc. | Q1 2021 Form 10-Q | 11 The following table shows the pre-tax gains and losses of the Company’s derivative and non-derivative instruments designated as cash flow and net investment hedges in OCI and the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three months ended December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019 (in millions): Three Months Ended December 26, 2020 December 28, 2019 Gains/(Losses) recognized in OCI – included in effectiveness assessment: Cash flow hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ ( 191 ) $ 271 Interest rate contracts 54 — Total $ ( 137 ) $ 271 Net investment hedges: Foreign currency debt $ — $ 24 Gains/(Losses) reclassified from AOCI into net income – included in effectiveness assessment: Cash flow hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ 314 $ 491 Interest rate contracts ( 3 ) ( 2 ) Total $ 311 $ 489 Amounts excluded from the effectiveness assessment of the Company’s hedges and recognized in OCI were losses of $ 138 million and $ 89 million for the three months ended December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, respectively. The following tables show information about the Company’s derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges and the related hedged items for the three months ended December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019 and as of December 26, 2020 and September 26, 2020 (in millions): Three Months Ended December 26, 2020 December 28, 2019 Gains/(Losses) on derivative instruments (1) : Foreign exchange contracts $ ( 753 ) $ ( 183 ) Interest rate contracts ( 167 ) ( 162 ) Total $ ( 920 ) $ ( 345 ) Gains/(Losses) related to hedged items (1) : Marketable securities $ 752 $ 183 Fixed-rate debt 167 162 Total $ 919 $ 345 Apple Inc. | Q1 2021 Form 10-Q | 12 December 26, 2020 September 26, 2020 Carrying amounts of hedged assets/(liabilities): Marketable securities (2) $ 17,009 $ 16,270 Fixed-rate debt (3) $ ( 20,866 ) $ ( 21,033 ) Cumulative hedging adjustments included in the carrying amounts of hedged items: Marketable securities carrying amount increases/(decreases) $ 956 $ 493 Fixed-rate debt carrying amount (increases)/decreases $ ( 1,374 ) $ ( 1,541 ) (1) Gains and losses related to fair value hedges are included in OI&E in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. (2) The carrying amounts of marketable securities that are designated as hedged items in fair value hedges are included in current marketable securities and non-current marketable securities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets (3) The carrying amounts of fixed-rate debt instruments that are designated as hedged items in fair value hedges are included in current term debt and non-current term debt in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The following table shows the notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments and credit risk amounts associated with outstanding or unsettled derivative instruments as of December 26, 2020 and September 26, 2020 (in millions): December 26, 2020 September 26, 2020 Notional Amount Credit Risk Amount Notional Amount Credit Risk Amount Instruments designated as accounting hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ 71,191 $ 524 $ 57,410 $ 749 Interest rate contracts $ 20,900 $ 1,443 $ 20,700 $ 1,557 Instruments not designated as accounting hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ 123,267 $ 780 $ 88,636 $ 303 The notional amounts for outstanding derivative instruments provide one measure of the transaction volume outstanding and do not represent the amount of the Company’s exposure to credit or market loss. The credit risk amounts represent the Company’s gross exposure to potential accounting loss on derivative instruments that are outstanding or unsettled if all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current currency or interest rates at each respective date. The Company’s exposure to credit loss and market risk will vary over time as currency and interest rates change. Although the table above reflects the notional and credit risk amounts of the Company’s derivative instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses associated with the exposures and transactions that the instruments are intended to hedge. The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments. The Company generally enters into master netting arrangements, which are designed to reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. The Company presents its derivative assets and derivative liabilities at their gross fair values in its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 26, 2020, the net cash collateral posted by the Company related to derivative instruments under its collateral security arrangements was $ 215 million. As of September 26, 2020, the net cash collateral received by the Company related to derivative instruments under its collateral security arrangements was $ 875 million. The Company includes gross collateral posted and received in other current assets and other current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, respectively. Under master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to the Company’s derivative contracts, the Company is allowed to net settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of December 26, 2020 and September 26, 2020, the potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the Company’s derivative contracts, including the effects of collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $ 3.5 billion and $ 2.8 billion, respectively, resulting in net derivative liabilities of $ 684 million and $ 312 million, respectively. Apple Inc. | Q1 2021 Form 10-Q | 13 Accounts Receivable Trade Receivables The Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, resellers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral or third-party credit support in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements. As of both December 26, 2020 and September 26, 2020, the Company had no customers that individually represented 10% or more of total trade receivables. The Company’s cellular network carriers accounted for 41 % of total trade receivables as of December 26, 2020. Vendor Non-Trade Receivables The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. As of December 26, 2020, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 61 % and 14 %. As of September 26, 2020, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 57 %, and 11 %. Note 4 – Condensed Consolidated Financial Statement Details The following tables show the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statement details as of December 26, 2020 and September 26, 2020 (in millions): Property, Plant and Equipment, Net December 26, 2020 September 26, 2020 Land and buildings $ 18,885 $ 17,952 Machinery, equipment and internal-use software 76,224 75,291 Leasehold improvements 10,384 10,283 Gross property, plant and equipment 105,493 103,526 Accumulated depreciation and amortization ( 67,560 ) ( 66,760 ) Total property, plant and equipment, net $ 37,933 $ 36,766 Other Non-Current Liabilities December 26, 2020 September 26, 2020 Long-term taxes payable $ 28,170 $ 28,170 Other non-current liabilities 27,872 26,320 Total other non-current liabilities $ 56,042 $ 54,490 Apple Inc. | Q1 2021 Form 10-Q | 14 Other Income/(Expense), Net The following table shows the detail of OI&E for the three months ended December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019 (in millions): Three Months Ended December 26, 2020 December 28, 2019 Interest and dividend income $ 747 $ 1,045 Interest expense ( 638 ) ( 785 ) Other income/(expense), net ( 64 ) 89 Total other income/(expense), net $ 45 $ 349 Note 5 – Income Taxes Uncertain Tax Positions As of December 26, 2020, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $ 17.1 billion, of which $ 9.0 billion, if recognized, would impact the Company’s effective tax rate. The Company had accrued $ 1.6 billion of gross interest and penalties related to income tax matters as of December 26, 2020. The Company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and many state and foreign jurisd ictions. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service concluded its review of the years 2013 through 2015 in 2018, and all years before 2016 are closed. Tax years after 2014 rem ain open in certain major foreign jurisdictions and are subject to examination by the taxing authorities. The Company believes that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Company’s tax audits are resolved in a manner inconsistent with its expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs. Although the timing of resolution and/or closure of audits is not certain, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that its gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease in the next 12 months by as mu ch as $ 4.1 billion. European Commission State Aid Decision On August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company (the “State Aid Decision”). The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The recovery amount was calculated to be € 13.1 billion, plus interest of € 1.2 billion. The Company and Ireland appealed the State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the “General Court”). On July 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September 25, 2020, the European Commission appealed the General Court’s decision to the European Court of Justice. The Company believes that any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision would be creditable against U.S. taxes, subject to any foreign tax credit limitations in the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. On an annual basis, the Company may request approval from the Irish Minister for Finance to reduce the recovery amount for certain taxes paid to other countries. As of December 26, 2020, the adjusted recovery amount was € 12.9 billion, excluding interest. The adjusted recovery amount plus interest is funded into escrow, where it will remain restricted from general use pending the conclusion of all legal proceedings.

Additionally, to manage foreign currency risk on certain of its foreign currency–denominated notes, the Company has entered into foreign currency swaps to effectively convert these notes to U.S. dollar–denominated notes. The effective interest rates for the Notes include the interest on the Notes, amortization of the discount or premium and, if applicable, adjustments related to hedging. The Company recognized $ 628 million and $ 757 million of interest cost on its term debt for the three months ended December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, respectively.

During the three months ended December 26, 2020, the Company repurchased 200 million shares of its common stock for $ 24.0 billion. The Company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. Under this program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Note 8 – Comprehensive Income The Company’s OCI consists of foreign currency translation adjustments from those subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, net deferred gains and losses on certain derivative instruments accounted for as hedges, and unrealized gains and losses on marketable debt securities classified as available-for-sale. The following table shows the pre-tax amounts reclassified from AOCI into the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, and the associated financial statement line items, for the three months ended December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019 (in millions): Three Months Ended Comprehensive Income Components Financial Statement Line Items December 26, 2020 December 28, 2019 Unrealized (gains)/losses on derivative instruments: Foreign exchange contracts Total net sales $ 104 $ ( 97 ) Total cost of sales 245 ( 171 ) Other income/(expense), net ( 628 ) ( 223 ) Interest rate contracts Other income/(expense), net 3 2 ( 276 ) ( 489 ) Unrealized (gains)/losses on marketable debt securities Other income/(expense), net ( 118 ) ( 13 ) Total amounts reclassified from AOCI $ ( 394 ) $ ( 502 ) The following table shows the changes in AOCI by component for the three months ended December 26, 2020 (in millions): Cumulative Foreign Currency Translation Unrealized Gains/Losses on Derivative Instruments Unrealized Gains/Losses on Marketable Debt Securities Total Balances as of September 26, 2020 $ ( 1,375 ) $ ( 877 ) $ 1,846 $ ( 406 ) Other comprehensive income/(loss) before reclassifications 549 ( 294 ) 708 963 Amounts reclassified from AOCI — ( 276 ) ( 118 ) ( 394 ) Tax effect — 83 ( 67 ) 16 Other comprehensive income/(loss) 549 ( 487 ) 523 585 Balances as of December 26, 2020 $ ( 826 ) $ ( 1,364 ) $ 2,369 $ 179 Note 9 – Benefit Plans Stock Plans The Company had 713 million shares reserved for future issuance under its stock plans as of December 26, 2020. RSUs granted under the Company’s stock plans generally vest over four years , based on continued employment, and are settled upon vesting in shares of the Company’s common stock on a one -for-one basis. RSUs granted under the Company’s stock plans reduce the number of shares available for grant under the plans by a factor of two times the number of RSUs granted. RSUs canceled and shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations increase the number of shares available for grant under the plans utilizing a factor of two times the number of RSUs canceled or shares withheld. Apple Inc. | Q1 2021 Form 10-Q | 17 Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans During the three months ended December 26, 2020, Section 16 officers Katherine L. Adams, Timothy D. Cook, Chris Kondo, Luca Maestri, Deirdre O’Brien and Jeffrey Williams had equity trading plans in place in accordance with Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) under the Exchange Act. An equity trading plan is a written document that pre-establishes the amounts, prices and dates (or formula for determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of the Company’s stock, including shares acquired under the Company’s employee and director equity plans. Restricted Stock Units A summary of the Company’s RSU activity and related information for the three months ended December 26, 2020 is as follows: Number of RSUs (in thousands) Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value Per RSU Aggregate Fair Value (in millions) Balance as of September 26, 2020 310,778 $ 51.58 RSUs granted 75,959 $ 112.75 RSUs vested ( 68,565 ) $ 44.91 RSUs canceled ( 2,819 ) $ 61.05 Balance as of December 26, 2020 315,353 $ 67.68 $ 41,617 The fair value as of the respective vesting dates of RSUs was $ 8.5 billion and $ 4.2 billion for the three months ended December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, respectively.

Note 10 – Commitments and Contingencies Accrued Warranty and Guarantees The following table shows changes in the Company’s accrued warranties and related costs for the three months ended December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019 (in millions): Three Months Ended December 26, 2020 December 28, 2019 Beginning accrued warranty and related costs $ 3,354 $ 3,570 Cost of warranty claims ( 723 ) ( 915 ) Accruals for product warranty 1,493 1,218 Ending accrued warranty and related costs $ 4,124 $ 3,873 The Company offers an iPhone Upgrade Program, which is available to customers who purchase a qualifying iPhone in the U.S., the U.K. and China mainland. The iPhone Upgrade Program provides customers the right to trade in that iPhone for a specified amount when purchasing a new iPhone, provided certain conditions are met. The Company accounts for the trade-in right as a guarantee liability and recognizes arrangement revenue net of the fair value of such right, with subsequent changes to the guarantee liability recognized within net sales. Apple Inc. | Q1 2021 Form 10-Q | 18 Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product Although most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets and other electronic devices. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements. The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Substantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia, with some Mac computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland. Unconditional Purchase Obligations The Company has entered into certain off–balance sheet commitments that require the future purchase of goods or services (“unconditional purchase obligations”). The Company’s unconditional purchase obligations primarily consist of payments for content creation, Internet and telecommunications services and supplier arrangements. As of December 26, 2020, the Company’s total future payments under noncancelable unconditional purchase obligations having a remaining term in excess of one year were $ 8.1 billion. Contingencies The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully resolved. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. When a loss related to a legal proceeding or claim is probable and reasonably estimable, the Company accrues its best estimate for the ultimate resolution of the matter. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims, except for the following matters: VirnetX VirnetX, Inc. (“VirnetX”) filed a lawsuit against the Company alleging that certain of the Company’s products infringe on patents owned by VirnetX. On April 11, 2018, a jury returned a verdict against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas (the “Eastern Texas District Court”). The Company appealed the verdict to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which remanded the case back to the Eastern Texas District Court, where a re-trial was held in October 2020. The jury returned a verdict against the Company and awarded damages of $ 503 million, which the Company intends to appeal. The Company has challenged the validity of the patents at issue in the re-trial at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the “PTO”), and the PTO has declared the patents invalid, subject to further appeal by VirnetX. Apple Inc. | Q1 2021 Form 10-Q | 19 iOS Performance Management Cases Various civil litigation matters have been filed in state and federal courts in the U.S. and in various international jurisdictions alleging violation of consumer protection laws, fraud, computer intrusion and other causes of action related to the Company’s performance management feature used in its iPhone operating systems, introduced to certain iPhones in iOS updates 10.2.1 and 11.2. The claims seek monetary damages and other non-monetary relief. On April 5, 2018, several U.S. federal actions were consolidated through a Multidistrict Litigation process into a single action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the “Northern California District Court”). On February 28, 2020, the parties in the Multidistrict Litigation reached a settlement to resolve the U.S. federal and California state class actions. Under the terms of the settlement, which the Northern California District Court preliminarily approved in May 2020, the Company has agreed to pay up to $ 500 million in the aggregate to certain U.S. owners of iPhones if certain conditions are met. The final amount of the settlement will be determined based on the number of consumers who file valid claims and the attorneys’ fee award. However, the Company has agreed to pay at least $ 310 million to settle the claims. In addition to civil litigation, the Company is also responding to governmental investigations and requests for information relating to the performance management feature. On November 18, 2020, the Company reached a settlement with a multi-state group of attorneys general. Under the terms of the settlement, the Company has agreed to pay an aggregate amount of $ 113 million to resolve civil, statutory claims. The Company continues to believe that its iPhones were not defective, that the performance management feature introduced with iOS updates 10.2.1 and 11.2 was intended to, and did, improve customers’ user experience, and that the Company did not make any misleading statements or fail to disclose any material information. French Competition Authority On March 16, 2020, the French Competition Authority (“FCA”) announced its decision that aspects of the Company’s sales and distribution practices in France violate French competition law and issued a fine of € 1.1 billion. The Company strongly disagrees with the FCA’s decision and has appealed. Optis Optis Wireless Technology, LLC and related entities (“Optis”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas against the Company alleging that certain of the Company’s products infringe on patents owned by Optis. On August 11, 2020, a jury returned a verdict against the Company and awarded damages of $ 506 million. The Company has asked the court to set aside the verdict, where the case remains pending. Note 11 – Segment Information and Geographic Data The Company reports segment information based on the “management” approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company’s reportable segments. The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described in Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of the 2020 Form 10-K. The Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company’s retail stores located in those geographic locations. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the reportable segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as research and development, corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges and other separately managed general and administrative costs. The Company does not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes. Apple Inc. | Q1 2021 Form 10-Q | 20 The following table shows information by reportable segment for the three months ended December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019 (in millions): Three Months Ended December 26, 2020 December 28, 2019 Americas: Net sales $ 46,310 $ 41,367 Operating income $ 15,785 $ 13,092 Europe: Net sales $ 27,306 $ 23,273 Operating income $ 9,589 $ 7,719 Greater China: Net sales $ 21,313 $ 13,578 Operating income $ 8,530 $ 5,363 Japan: Net sales $ 8,285 $ 6,223 Operating income $ 3,503 $ 2,778 Rest of Asia Pacific: Net sales $ 8,225 $ 7,378 Operating income $ 2,953 $ 2,731 A reconciliation of the Company’s segment operating income to the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three months ended December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019 is as follows (in millions): Three Months Ended December 26, 2020 December 28, 2019 Segment operating income $ 40,360 $ 31,683 Research and development expense ( 5,163 ) ( 4,451 ) Other corporate expenses, net ( 1,663 ) ( 1,663 ) Total operating income $ 33,534 $ 25,569 Apple Inc. | Q1 2021 Form 10-Q | 21 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This section and other parts of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“Form 10-Q”) contain forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example, statements in this Form 10-Q regarding the potential future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s business and results of operations are forward-looking statements . Forward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as “future,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “predicts,” “will,” “would,” “could,” “can,” “may,” and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company’s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 26, 2020 (the “2020 Form 10-K”) under the heading “Risk Factors.” The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law. Unless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Company’s fiscal calendar, and references to particular years, quarters, months or periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Each of the terms the “Company” and “Apple” as used herein refers collectively to Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, unless otherwise stated. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the 2020 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. Available Information The Company periodically provides certain information for investors on its corporate website, www.apple.com, and its investor relations website, investor.apple.com. This includes press releases and other information about financial performance, information on corporate governance and details related to the Company’s annual meeting of shareholders. The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form 10-Q is not incorporated by reference into this filing. Further, the Company’s references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only. Quarterly Highlights Business Seasonality and Product Introductions The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction. COVID-19 Update The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted governments and businesses to take unprecedented measures, such as restrictions on travel and business operations, temporary closures of businesses, and quarantines and shelter-in-place orders. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets. The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have affected and could in the future materially impact the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. During the first quarter of 2021, aspects of the Company’s business continued to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with many of the Company’s retail stores, as well as channel partner points of sale, temporarily closed at various times, and the vast majority of the Company’s employees working remotely. The Company has reopened some of its offices and retail stores, subject to operating restrictions to protect public health and the health and safety of employees and customers, and it continues to work on safely reopening the remainder of its offices and retail stores, subject to local rules and regulations. The full extent of the future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s operational and financial performance is currently uncertain and will depend on many factors outside the Company’s control, including, without limitation, the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic; the availability, distribution and effectiveness of vaccines; the imposition of protective public safety measures; and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products. Refer to Part I, Item 1A of the 2020 Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors,” for more information. Apple Inc. | Q1 2021 Form 10-Q | 22 The Company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, along with commercial paper and other short-term liquidity arrangements, will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital asset purchases, dividends, share repurchases, debt repayments and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations. First Quarter Fiscal 2021 Highlights Total net sales increased 21% or $19.6 billion during the first quarter of 2021 compared to the same quarter in 2020, driven by higher net sales in all Products and Services categories.

Gross Margin Products and Services gross margin and gross margin percentage for the three months ended December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019 were as follows (dollars in millions): Three Months Ended December 26, 2020 December 28, 2019 Gross margin: Products $ 33,548 $ 27,029 Services 10,780 8,188 Total gross margin $ 44,328 $ 35,217 Gross margin percentage: Products 35.1 % 34.2 % Services 68.4 % 64.4 % Total gross margin percentage 39.8 % 38.4 % Products Gross Margin Products gross margin increased during the first quarter of 2021 compared to the same quarter in 2020 due primarily to higher Products volume and a different Products mix. Products gross margin percentage increased during the first quarter of 2021 compared to the same quarter in 2020 due primarily to higher leverage. Services Gross Margin Services gross margin increased during the first quarter of 2021 compared to the same quarter in 2020 due primarily to higher Services net sales and a different Services mix. Services gross margin percentage increased during the first quarter of 2021 compared to the same quarter in 2020 due primarily to a different Services mix and higher leverage, partially offset by higher Services costs. The Company’s future gross margins can be impacted by a variety of factors, as discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the 2020 Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.” As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and remain under downward pressure. Operating Expenses Operating expenses for the three months ended December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019 were as follows (dollars in millions): Three Months Ended December 26, 2020 December 28, 2019 Research and development $ 5,163 $ 4,451 Percentage of total net sales 5 % 5 % Selling, general and administrative $ 5,631 $ 5,197 Percentage of total net sales 5 % 6 % Total operating expenses $ 10,794 $ 9,648 Percentage of total net sales 10 % 11 % Apple Inc. | Q1 2021 Form 10-Q | 25 Research and Development The growth in research and development (“R&D”) expense during the first quarter of 2021 compared to the same quarter in 2020 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses. The Company continues to believe that focused investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace, and to the development of new and updated products and services that are central to the Company’s core business strategy. Selling, General and Administrative The growth in selling, general and administrative expense during the first quarter of 2021 compared to the same quarter in 2020 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses and higher variable selling expenses.

The weighted-average interest rate earned by the Company on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was 1.49% and 2.08% in the first quarter of 2021 and 2020, respectively. Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for the three months ended December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019 were as follows (dollars in millions): Three Months Ended December 26, 2020 December 28, 2019 Provision for income taxes $ 4,824 $ 3,682 Effective tax rate 14.4 % 14.2 % Statutory federal income tax rate 21 % 21 % The Company’s effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2021 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to lower tax rates on foreign earnings and tax benefits from share-based compensation. The Company’s effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2021 was relatively flat compared to the same quarter in 2020.

The Company pays the deemed repatriation tax payable in installments in accordance with the Act. Other Non-Current Liabilities The Company’s remaining other non-current liabilities primarily consist of items for which the Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing or amount of payments. Apple Inc. | Q1 2021 Form 10-Q | 28 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates, and such differences may be material. Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of the 2020 Form 10-K, and “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in Part II, Item 7 of the 2020 Form 10-K describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements.

Apple Inc. | Q3 2020 Form 10-Q | 5 Apple Inc. Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation and Preparation The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively “Apple” or the “Company”). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. In the opinion of the Company’s management, the condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. These condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the Company’s annual consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2019 (the “2019 Form 10-K”). The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. A 14th week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. The Company’s fiscal years 2020 and 2019 span 52 weeks each. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Leases At the beginning of the first quarter of 2020, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (the “FASB”) Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (“ASU 2016-02”), and additional ASUs issued to clarify and update the guidance in ASU 2016-02 (collectively, the “new leases standard”), which modifies lease accounting for lessees to increase transparency and comparability by recording lease assets and liabilities for operating leases and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The Company adopted the new leases standard utilizing the modified retrospective transition method, under which amounts in prior periods presented were not restated. For contracts existing at the time of adoption, the Company elected to not reassess (i) whether any are or contain leases, (ii) lease classification, and (iii) initial direct costs. Upon adoption, the Company recorded $ 7.5 billion of right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and $ 8.1 billion of lease liabilities on its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. Hedging At the beginning of the first quarter of 2020, the Company adopted FASB ASU No. 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities (“ASU 2017-12”). ASU 2017-12 expands component and fair value hedging, specifies the presentation of the effects of hedging instruments, eliminates the separate measurement and presentation of hedge ineffectiveness, and updates disclosure requirements related to hedging. The Company adopted ASU 2017-12 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. Upon adoption, the Company recorded a $ 136 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (“AOCI”) and a corresponding decrease in retained earnings in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Shareholders’ Equity. Apple Inc. | Q3 2020 Form 10-Q | 6 Earnings Per Share The following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 27, 2020 and June 29, 2019 (net income in millions and shares in thousands): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended June 27, 2020 June 29, 2019 June 27, 2020 June 29, 2019 Numerator: Net income $ 11,253 $ 10,044 $ 44,738 $ 41,570 Denominator: Weighted-average basic shares outstanding 4,312,573 4,570,633 4,362,571 4,660,175 Effect of dilutive securities 42,215 30,747 42,124 31,584 Weighted-average diluted shares 4,354,788 4,601,380 4,404,695 4,691,759 Basic earnings per share $ 2.61 $ 2.20 $ 10.25 $ 8.92 Diluted earnings per share $ 2.58 $ 2.18 $ 10.16 $ 8.86 Potentially dilutive securities representing 1.5 million and 20.5 million shares of common stock were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 29, 2019, respectively, because their effect would have been antidilutive. Note 2 – Revenue Recognition Net sales consist of revenue from the sale of iPhone ® , Mac ® , iPad ® , Services and other products. The Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is transferred to its customers. Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company’s Products net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company’s Services net sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable. The Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer incentive programs based on the Company’s expectations and historical experience. For arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are capable of being distinct, the Company allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (“SSPs”). When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are established that reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company’s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation. The Company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud ® , Siri ® and Maps. The third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company’s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided. Cost of sales related to delivered hardware and bundled software, including estimated warranty costs, are recognized at the time of sale. Costs incurred to provide product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights are recognized as cost of sales as incurred. Apple Inc. | Q3 2020 Form 10-Q | 7 For certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For these arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized revenue, and has elected not to disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services. For the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products including, but not limited to, evaluating if it can establish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party applications sold through the App Store ® , Mac App Store, TV App Store and Watch App Store and certain digital content sold through the Company’s other digital content stores, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for such sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission it retains. The Company has elected to record revenue net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities, with the collected taxes recorded within other current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority. Deferred Revenue As of June 27, 2020 and September 28, 2019, the Company had total deferred revenue of $ 9.8 billion and $ 8.1 billion, respectively. As of June 27, 2020, the Company expects 65 % of total deferred revenue to be realized in less than a year, 26 % within one-to-two years, 7 % within two-to-three years and 2 % in greater than three years. Disaggregated Revenue Net sales disaggregated by significant products and services for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 27, 2020 and June 29, 2019 were as follows (in millions): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended June 27, 2020 June 29, 2019 June 27, 2020 June 29, 2019 iPhone (1) $ 26,418 $ 25,986 $ 111,337 $ 109,019 Mac (1) 7,079 5,820 19,590 18,749 iPad (1) 6,582 5,023 16,927 16,624 Wearables, Home and Accessories (1)(2) 6,450 5,525 22,744 17,962 Services (3) 13,156 11,455 39,219 33,780 Total net sales (4) $ 59,685 $ 53,809 $ 209,817 $ 196,134 (1) Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are bundled in the sales price of the respective product. (2) Wearables, Home and Accessories net sales include sales of AirPods®, Apple TV®, Apple Watch®, Beats® products, HomePod®, iPod touch® and Apple-branded and third-party accessories. (3) Services net sales include sales from the Company’s digital content stores and streaming services, AppleCare®, Advertising and other services. Services net sales also include amortization of the deferred value of Maps, Siri, and free iCloud storage and Apple TV + services, which are bundled in the sales price of certain products. (4) Includes $ 2.1 billion of revenue recognized in the three months ended June 27, 2020 that was included in deferred revenue as of March 28, 2020, $ 2.0 billion of revenue recognized in the three months ended June 29, 2019 that was included in deferred revenue as of March 30, 2019, $ 4.0 billion of revenue recognized in the nine months ended June 27, 2020 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 28, 2019, and $ 4.9 billion of revenue recognized in the nine months ended June 29, 2019 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 29, 2018. The Company’s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable segment in Note 11, “Segment Information and Geographic Data” for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 27, 2020 and June 29, 2019.

(3) As of June 27, 2020 and September 28, 2019, total marketable securities included $ 18.3 billion and $ 18.9 billion, respectively, that was restricted from general use, related to the State Aid Decision (refer to Note 5, “Income Taxes”) and other agreements. Additionally, as of June 27, 2020, $ 5.3 billion of marketable securities were pledged as collateral under repurchase agreements (refer to Note 6, “Debt”). Apple Inc. | Q3 2020 Form 10-Q | 9 The Company may sell certain of its marketable debt securities prior to their stated maturities for reasons including, but not limited to, managing liquidity, credit risk, duration and asset allocation. The maturities of the Company’s non-current marketable debt securities generally range from one to five years . The Company typically invests in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company’s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. Fair values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. When evaluating a marketable debt security for other-than-temporary impairment, the Company reviews factors such as the duration and extent to which the fair value of the security is less than its cost, the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto, and the Company’s intent to sell, or whether it will more likely than not be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. As of June 27, 2020, the Company does not consider any of its marketable debt securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired. Non-Marketable Securities The Company holds non-marketable equity securities of certain privately held companies without readily determinable fair values. As of June 27, 2020 and September 28, 2019, the Company’s non-marketable equity securities had a carrying value of $ 2.8 billion and $ 2.9 billion, respectively. Restricted Cash A reconciliation of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets to cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as of June 27, 2020 and September 28, 2019 is as follows (in millions): June 27, 2020 September 28, 2019 Cash and cash equivalents $ 33,383 $ 48,844 Restricted cash included in other current assets 29 23 Restricted cash included in other non-current assets 1,627 1,357 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 35,039 $ 50,224 The Company’s restricted cash primarily consisted of cash to support the Company’s iPhone Upgrade Program. Derivative Financial Instruments The Company may use derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risk on expected future cash flows, net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries, and certain existing assets and liabilities. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign currency exchange or interest rates. To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar may hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue, and subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar may hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries’ functional currencies. The Company may enter into forward contracts, option contracts or other instruments to manage this risk and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months. To protect the net investment in a foreign operation from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset a portion of the changes in the carrying amounts of these investments due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, the Company may use non-derivative financial instruments, such as its foreign currency–denominated debt, as hedges of its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries. In both of these cases, the Company designates these instruments as net investment hedges. To protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. These instruments may offset a portion of the foreign currency remeasurement gains or losses, or changes in fair value. The Company may designate these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of June 27, 2020, the Company’s hedged term debt– and marketable securities–related foreign currency transactions are expected to be recognized within 22 years. Apple Inc. | Q3 2020 Form 10-Q | 10 The Company may also enter into non-designated foreign currency contracts to offset a portion of the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. To protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. These instruments may offset a portion of the changes in interest income or expense, or changes in fair value. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of June 27, 2020, the Company’s hedged interest rate transactions are expected to be recognized within seven years . Cash Flow Hedges Cash flow hedge amounts that are included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in AOCI until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of foreign currency revenue are recognized as a component of net sales in the same period as the related revenue is recognized, and deferred gains and losses related to cash flow hedges of inventory purchases are recognized as a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related costs are recognized. Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of interest income or expense are recognized in other income/(expense), net (“OI&E”) in the same period as the related income or expense is recognized. Generally, for options designated as cash flow hedges, the time value is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognized in the financial statement line item to which the hedge relates on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in other comprehensive income/(loss) (“OCI”). Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially identified time period or within a subsequent two-month time period. Deferred gains and losses in AOCI associated with such derivative instruments are reclassified into OI&E in the period of de-designation. Any subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are reflected in OI&E unless they are re-designated as hedges of other transactions. Net Investment Hedges Net investment hedge amounts that are included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recorded in OCI as a part of the cumulative translation adjustment. For foreign exchange forward contracts designated as net investment hedges, the forward carry component is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognized in OCI on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OCI. Fair Value Hedges Fair value hedge gains and losses related to amounts that are included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in earnings along with a corresponding loss or gain related to the change in value of the hedged item in the same line in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. For foreign exchange forward contracts designated as fair value hedges, the forward carry component is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognized in OI&E on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OCI. Amounts excluded from the effectiveness assessment of fair value hedges and recognized in OI&E were gains of $ 119 million and $ 373 million for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 27, 2020, respectively. Non-Designated Derivatives Derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are adjusted to fair value through earnings in the financial statement line item to which the derivative relates. Apple Inc. | Q3 2020 Form 10-Q | 11 The Company records all derivatives in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The Company’s accounting treatment for these derivative instruments is based on its hedge designation. The following tables show the Company’s derivative instruments at gross fair value as of June 27, 2020 and September 28, 2019 (in millions): June 27, 2020 Fair Value of Derivatives Designated as Hedge Instruments Fair Value of Derivatives Not Designated as Hedge Instruments Total Fair Value Derivative assets (1) : Foreign exchange contracts $ 1,247 $ 172 $ 1,419 Interest rate contracts $ 1,612 $ — $ 1,612 Derivative liabilities (2) : Foreign exchange contracts $ 1,757 $ 277 $ 2,034 September 28, 2019 Fair Value of Derivatives Designated as Hedge Instruments Fair Value of Derivatives Not Designated as Hedge Instruments Total Fair Value Derivative assets (1) : Foreign exchange contracts $ 1,798 $ 323 $ 2,121 Interest rate contracts $ 685 $ — $ 685 Derivative liabilities (2) : Foreign exchange contracts $ 1,341 $ 160 $ 1,501 Interest rate contracts $ 105 $ — $ 105 (1) The fair value of derivative assets is measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and is included in other current assets and other non-current assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. (2) The fair value of derivative liabilities is measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and is included in other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company classifies cash flows related to derivative financial instruments as operating activities in its Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

The following tables show information about the Company’s derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges and the related hedged items for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 27, 2020 and June 29, 2019 and as of June 27, 2020 (in millions): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended June 27, 2020 June 29, 2019 June 27, 2020 June 29, 2019 Gains/(Losses) on derivative instruments (1) : Foreign exchange contracts $ ( 675 ) $ ( 136 ) $ ( 422 ) $ 509 Interest rate contracts 57 671 1,185 1,793 Total $ ( 618 ) $ 535 $ 763 $ 2,302 Gains/(Losses) related to hedged items (1) : Marketable securities $ 675 $ 136 $ 422 $ ( 508 ) Fixed-rate debt ( 57 ) ( 671 ) ( 1,185 ) ( 1,793 ) Total $ 618 $ ( 535 ) $ ( 763 ) $ ( 2,301 ) Apple Inc. | Q3 2020 Form 10-Q | 13 June 27, 2020 Carrying amounts of hedged assets/(liabilities): Marketable securities (2) $ 15,736 Fixed-rate debt (3) $ ( 21,104 ) Cumulative hedging adjustments included in the carrying amounts of hedged items: Marketable securities carrying amount increases/(decreases) $ ( 146 ) Fixed-rate debt carrying amount (increases)/decreases $ ( 1,612 ) (1) Gains and losses related to fair value hedges are included in OI&E in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. (2) The carrying amounts of marketable securities that are designated as hedged items in fair value hedges are included in current marketable securities and non-current marketable securities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. (3) The carrying amounts of fixed-rate debt instruments that are designated as hedged items in fair value hedges are included in current term debt and non-current term debt in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. The following table shows the notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments and credit risk amounts associated with outstanding or unsettled derivative instruments as of June 27, 2020 and September 28, 2019 (in millions): June 27, 2020 September 28, 2019 Notional Amount Credit Risk Amount Notional Amount Credit Risk Amount Instruments designated as accounting hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ 52,845 $ 1,247 $ 61,795 $ 1,798 Interest rate contracts $ 19,500 $ 1,612 $ 31,250 $ 685 Instruments not designated as accounting hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ 50,208 $ 172 $ 76,868 $ 323 The notional amounts for outstanding derivative instruments provide one measure of the transaction volume outstanding and do not represent the amount of the Company’s exposure to credit or market loss. The credit risk amounts represent the Company’s gross exposure to potential accounting loss on derivative instruments that are outstanding or unsettled if all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current currency or interest rates at each respective date. The Company’s exposure to credit loss and market risk will vary over time as currency and interest rates change. Although the table above reflects the notional and credit risk amounts of the Company’s derivative instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses associated with the exposures and transactions that the instruments are intended to hedge. The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments. The Company generally enters into master netting arrangements, which are designed to reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. The Company presents its derivative assets and derivative liabilities at their gross fair values in its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of June 27, 2020 and September 28, 2019, the net cash collateral received by the Company related to derivative instruments under its collateral security arrangements was $ 1.2 billion and $ 1.6 billion, respectively, which were included in other current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Under master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to the Company’s derivative contracts, the Company is allowed to net settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of June 27, 2020 and September 28, 2019, the potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the Company’s derivative contracts, including the effects of collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $ 3.3 billion and $ 2.7 billion, respectively, resulting in net derivative liabilities of $ 197 million and $ 407 million, respectively. Apple Inc. | Q3 2020 Form 10-Q | 14 Accounts Receivable Trade Receivables The Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, resellers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral or third-party credit support in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements. As of both June 27, 2020 and September 28, 2019, the Company had no customers that individually represented 10% or more of total trade receivables. The Company’s cellular network carriers accounted for 32 % and 51 % of total trade receivables as of June 27, 2020 and September 28, 2019, respectively. Vendor Non-Trade Receivables The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. As of June 27, 2020, the Company had three vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 49 %, 18 % and 11 %. As of September 28, 2019, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 59 % and 14 %. Note 4 – Condensed Consolidated Financial Statement Details The following tables show the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statement details as of June 27, 2020 and September 28, 2019 (in millions): Property, Plant and Equipment, Net June 27, 2020 September 28, 2019 Land and buildings $ 18,068 $ 17,085 Machinery, equipment and internal-use software 72,982 69,797 Leasehold improvements 9,867 9,075 Gross property, plant and equipment 100,917 95,957 Accumulated depreciation and amortization ( 65,230 ) ( 58,579 ) Total property, plant and equipment, net $ 35,687 $ 37,378 Other Non-Current Liabilities June 27, 2020 September 28, 2019 Long-term taxes payable $ 28,188 $ 29,545 Other non-current liabilities 27,508 20,958 Total other non-current liabilities $ 55,696 $ 50,503 Apple Inc. | Q3 2020 Form 10-Q | 15 Other Income/(Expense), Net The following table shows the detail of OI&E for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 27, 2020 and June 29, 2019 (in millions): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended June 27, 2020 June 29, 2019 June 27, 2020 June 29, 2019 Interest and dividend income $ 901 $ 1,190 $ 2,995 $ 3,855 Interest expense ( 697 ) ( 866 ) ( 2,239 ) ( 2,766 ) Other income/(expense), net ( 158 ) 43 ( 79 ) 216 Total other income/(expense), net $ 46 $ 367 $ 677 $ 1,305 Note 5 – Income Taxes Uncertain Tax Positions As of June 27, 2020, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $ 16.2 billion, of which $ 8.6 billion, if recognized, would impact the Company’s effective tax rate. The Company had accrued $ 1.3 billion of gross interest and penalties related to income tax matters as of June 27, 2020. The Company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and many state and foreign jurisdictions. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service concluded its review of the years 2013 through 2015 in 2018, and all years before 2016 are closed. Tax years after 2014 remain open in certain major foreign jurisdictions and are subject to examination by the taxing authorities. The Company believes that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Company’s tax audits are resolved in a manner inconsistent with its expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs. Although the timing of resolution and/or closure of audits is not certain, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that its gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease in the next 12 months by as much as $ 4.8 billion. European Commission State Aid Decision On August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company (the “State Aid Decision”). The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The recovery amount was calculated to be € 13.1 billion, plus interest of € 1.2 billion. The Company and Ireland appealed the State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the “General Court”). On July 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. The General Court’s judgment is subject to appeal by the European Commission. On an annual basis, the Company may request approval from the Irish Minister for Finance to reduce the recovery amount for certain taxes paid to other countries. As of June 27, 2020, the adjusted recovery amount was € 12.9 billion, excluding interest. The adjusted recovery amount plus interest is funded into escrow, where it will remain restricted from general use pending the conclusion of all legal proceedings. Refer to the Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities section of Note 3, “Financial Instruments” for more information. Apple Inc. | Q3 2020 Form 10-Q | 16 Note 6 – Debt Commercial Paper and Repurchase Agreements The Company issues unsecured short-term promissory notes (“Commercial Paper”) pursuant to a commercial paper program. The Company uses net proceeds from the commercial paper program for general corporate purposes, including dividends and share repurchases. As of both June 27, 2020 and September 28, 2019, the Company had $ 6.0 billion of Commercial Paper outstanding with maturities generally less than nine months . The weighted-average interest rate of the Company’s Commercial Paper was 0.77 % and 2.24 % as of June 27, 2020 and September 28, 2019, respectively. The following table provides a summary of cash flows associated with the issuance and maturities of Commercial Paper for the nine months ended June 27, 2020 and June 29, 2019 (in millions): Nine Months Ended June 27, 2020 June 29, 2019 Maturities 90 days or less: Proceeds from/(Repayments of) commercial paper, net $ 401 $ ( 3,720 ) Maturities greater than 90 days: Proceeds from commercial paper 5,373 12,977 Repayments of commercial paper ( 5,743 ) ( 11,283 ) Proceeds from/(Repayments of) commercial paper, net ( 370 ) 1,694 Total proceeds from/(repayments of) commercial paper, net $ 31 $ ( 2,026 ) In 2020, the Company entered into agreements to sell certain of its marketable securities with a promise to repurchase the securities at a specified time and amount (“Repos”). Due to the Company’s continuing involvement with the marketable securities, the Company accounts for its Repos as collateralized borrowings. As of June 27, 2020, the Company had $ 5.2 billion of Repo liabilities outstanding with maturities of less than three months , and had pledged $ 5.3 billion of marketable securities as collateral. Term Debt As of June 27, 2020, the Company had outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $ 100.1 billion (collectively the “Notes”). The Notes are senior unsecured obligations and interest is payable in arrears. The following table provides a summary of the Company’s term debt as of June 27, 2020 and September 28, 2019: Maturities (calendar year) June 27, 2020 September 28, 2019 Amount (in millions) Effective Interest Rate Amount (in millions) Effective Interest Rate 2013 – 2019 debt issuances: Floating-rate notes 2021 – 2022 $ 2,250 0.80 % – 1.49 % $ 4,250 2.25 % – 3.28 % Fixed-rate 0.375 % – 4.650 % notes 2020 – 2049 87,055 0.28 % – 4.78 % 97,429 0.28 % – 4.78 % First quarter 2020 debt issuance of € 2.0 billion: Fixed-rate 0.000 % – 0.500 % notes 2025 – 2031 2,260 0.03 % – 0.56 % — — % Third quarter 2020 debt issuance of $ 8.5 billion: Fixed-rate 0.750 % – 2.650 % notes 2023 – 2050 8,500 0.84 % – 2.72 % — — % Total term debt 100,065 101,679 Unamortized premium/(discount) and issuance costs, net ( 279 ) ( 224 ) Hedge accounting fair value adjustments 1,771 612 Less: Current portion of term debt ( 7,509 ) ( 10,260 ) Total non-current portion of term debt $ 94,048 $ 91,807 Apple Inc. | Q3 2020 Form 10-Q | 17 To manage interest rate risk on certain of its U.S. dollar–denominated fixed- or floating-rate notes, the Company has entered into interest rate swaps to effectively convert the fixed interest rates to floating interest rates or the floating interest rates to fixed interest rates on a portion of these notes. Additionally, to manage foreign currency risk on certain of its foreign currency–denominated notes, the Company has entered into foreign currency swaps to effectively convert these notes to U.S. dollar–denominated notes. As of September 28, 2019, a portion of the Company’s Japanese yen–denominated notes with a carrying value of $ 1.0 billion was designated as a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of the Company’s net investment in a foreign operation. The Company’s Japanese yen–denominated notes matured during the third quarter of 2020 and the associated net investment hedges were terminated. For further discussion regarding the Company’s use of derivative instruments, refer to the Derivative Financial Instruments section of Note 3, “Financial Instruments.” The effective interest rates for the Notes include the interest on the Notes, amortization of the discount or premium and, if applicable, adjustments related to hedging. The Company recognized $ 664 million and $ 2.1 billion of interest cost on its term debt for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 27, 2020, respectively. The Company recognized $ 790 million and $ 2.4 billion of interest cost on its term debt for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 29, 2019, respectively. As of June 27, 2020 and September 28, 2019, the fair value of the Company’s Notes, based on Level 2 inputs, was $ 110.8 billion and $ 107.5 billion, respectively. Note 7 – Shareholders’ Equity Share Repurchase Program As of June 27, 2020, the Company was authorized to purchase up to $ 225 billion of the Company’s common stock under a share repurchase program, of which $ 150.6 billion had been utilized. During the nine months ended June 27, 2020, the Company repurchased 186.4 million shares of its common stock for $ 54.5 billion, including 35.2 million shares delivered under a $ 10.0 billion November 2019 accelerated share repurchase arrangement (“ASR”) and 15.2 million shares initially delivered under a $ 6.0 billion May 2020 ASR. The Company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. Under this program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Under the Company’s ASRs, financial institutions deliver shares of the Company’s common stock during the purchase period of each ASR in exchange for an up-front payment. The total number of shares ultimately delivered under the May 2020 ASR, and therefore the average repurchase price paid per share, is determined based on the volume-weighted average price of the Company’s common stock during the purchase period, which will end in or before August 2020. The shares received are retired in the periods they are delivered, and the up-front payment is accounted for as a reduction to retained earnings in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Statement of Shareholders’ Equity in the period the payment is made. Common Stock Split On July 30, 2020, the Company announced a four -for-one split of its common stock to shareholders of record as of the close of business on August 24, 2020. Trading of the Company’s common stock will begin on a split-adjusted basis on August 31, 2020. Note 8 – Comprehensive Income The Company’s OCI consists of foreign currency translation adjustments from those subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, net deferred gains and losses on certain derivative instruments accounted for as hedges, and unrealized gains and losses on marketable debt securities classified as available-for-sale. Apple Inc. | Q3 2020 Form 10-Q | 18 The following table shows the pre-tax amounts reclassified from AOCI into the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, and the associated financial statement line items, for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 27, 2020 and June 29, 2019 (in millions): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended Comprehensive Income Components Financial Statement Line Items June 27, 2020 June 29, 2019 June 27, 2020 June 29, 2019 Unrealized (gains)/losses on derivative instruments: Foreign exchange contracts Total net sales $ ( 270 ) $ ( 68 ) $ ( 333 ) $ ( 102 ) Total cost of sales ( 362 ) 13 ( 521 ) ( 438 ) Other income/(expense), net ( 760 ) 3 ( 212 ) 451 Interest rate contracts Other income/(expense), net 3 2 6 5 ( 1,389 ) ( 50 ) ( 1,060 ) ( 84 ) Unrealized (gains)/losses on marketable debt securities Other income/(expense), net ( 14 ) ( 28 ) 10 55 Total amounts reclassified from AOCI $ ( 1,403 ) $ ( 78 ) $ ( 1,050 ) $ ( 29 ) The following table shows the changes in AOCI by component for the nine months ended June 27, 2020 (in millions): Cumulative Foreign Currency Translation Unrealized Gains/Losses on Derivative Instruments Unrealized Gains/Losses on Marketable Debt Securities Total Balances as of September 28, 2019 $ ( 1,463 ) $ 172 $ 707 $ ( 584 ) Other comprehensive income/(loss) before reclassifications ( 167 ) 32 1,167 1,032 Amounts reclassified from AOCI — ( 1,060 ) 10 ( 1,050 ) Tax effect ( 3 ) 190 ( 271 ) ( 84 ) Other comprehensive income/(loss) ( 170 ) ( 838 ) 906 ( 102 ) Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle (1) — 136 — 136 Balances as of June 27, 2020 $ ( 1,633 ) $ ( 530 ) $ 1,613 $ ( 550 ) (1) Refer to Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” for more information on the Company’s adoption of ASU 2017-12 at the beginning of the first quarter of 2020. Note 9 – Benefit Plans Stock Plans The Company had 203.3 million shares reserved for future issuance under its stock plans as of June 27, 2020. Restricted stock units (“RSUs”) granted under the Company’s stock plans generally vest over four years , based on continued employment, and are settled upon vesting in shares of the Company’s common stock on a one -for-one basis. RSUs granted under the Company’s stock plans reduce the number of shares available for grant under the plans by a factor of two times the number of RSUs granted. RSUs canceled and shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations increase the number of shares available for grant under the plans utilizing a factor of two times the number of RSUs canceled or shares withheld. Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans During the three months ended June 27, 2020, Section 16 officers Katherine L. Adams, Timothy D. Cook, Chris Kondo, Luca Maestri, Deirdre O’Brien and Jeffrey Williams had equity trading plans in place in accordance with Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) under the Exchange Act. An equity trading plan is a written document that pre-establishes the amounts, prices and dates (or formula for determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of the Company’s stock, including shares acquired under the Company’s employee and director equity plans. Apple Inc. | Q3 2020 Form 10-Q | 19 Restricted Stock Units A summary of the Company’s RSU activity and related information for the nine months ended June 27, 2020 is as follows: Number of RSUs (in thousands) Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value Per RSU Aggregate Fair Value (in millions) Balance as of September 28, 2019 81,517 $ 169.18 RSUs granted 37,815 $ 229.58 RSUs vested ( 37,076 ) $ 161.71 RSUs canceled ( 3,122 ) $ 190.50 Balance as of June 27, 2020 79,134 $ 200.70 $ 27,984 The fair value as of the respective vesting dates of RSUs was $ 5.0 billion and $ 9.8 billion for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 27, 2020, respectively, and was $ 3.7 billion and $ 8.1 billion for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 29, 2019, respectively. Share-Based Compensation The following table shows share-based compensation expense and the related income tax benefit included in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 27, 2020 and June 29, 2019 (in millions): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended June 27, 2020 June 29, 2019 June 27, 2020 June 29, 2019 Share-based compensation expense $ 1,698 $ 1,496 $ 5,105 $ 4,569 Income tax benefit related to share-based compensation expense $ ( 740 ) $ ( 502 ) $ ( 1,942 ) $ ( 1,583 ) As of June 27, 2020, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding RSUs and stock options was $ 13.4 billion, which the Company expects to recognize over a weighted-average period of 2.7 years. Note 10 – Commitments and Contingencies Accrued Warranty and Guarantees The following table shows changes in the Company’s accrued warranties and related costs for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 27, 2020 and June 29, 2019 (in millions): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended June 27, 2020 June 29, 2019 June 27, 2020 June 29, 2019 Beginning accrued warranty and related costs $ 3,923 $ 3,487 $ 3,570 $ 3,692 Cost of warranty claims ( 576 ) ( 912 ) ( 2,180 ) ( 2,823 ) Accruals for product warranty 557 548 2,514 2,254 Ending accrued warranty and related costs $ 3,904 $ 3,123 $ 3,904 $ 3,123 The Company offers an iPhone Upgrade Program, which is available to customers who purchase a qualifying iPhone in the U.S., the U.K. and mainland China. The iPhone Upgrade Program provides customers the right to trade in that iPhone for a specified amount when purchasing a new iPhone, provided certain conditions are met. The Company accounts for the trade-in right as a guarantee liability and recognizes arrangement revenue net of the fair value of such right, with subsequent changes to the guarantee liability recognized within net sales. Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product Although most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets and other electronic devices. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. Apple Inc. | Q3 2020 Form 10-Q | 20 The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements. The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Substantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia, with some Mac computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland. Unconditional Purchase Obligations The Company has entered into certain off–balance sheet commitments that require the future purchase of goods or services (“unconditional purchase obligations”). The Company’s unconditional purchase obligations primarily consist of payments for supplier arrangements, Internet and telecommunication services, intellectual property licenses and content creation. As of June 27, 2020, the Company’s total future payments under noncancelable unconditional purchase obligations having a remaining term in excess of one year were $ 9.2 billion. Contingencies The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully resolved. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims, except for the following matters: VirnetX VirnetX, Inc. (“VirnetX”) filed a lawsuit against the Company alleging that certain of the Company’s products infringe on patents owned by VirnetX. On April 11, 2018, a jury returned a verdict against the Company and awarded damages of $ 503 million. The Company appealed the verdict to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which remanded the case back to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, where it is scheduled for a re-trial in August 2020. The Company has challenged the validity of the patents at issue in the re-trial at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the “PTO”), and the PTO has declared the patents invalid, subject to further appeal by VirnetX. iOS Performance Management Cases Various civil litigation matters have been filed in state and federal courts in the U.S. and in various international jurisdictions alleging violation of consumer protection laws, fraud, computer intrusion and other causes of action related to the Company’s performance management feature used in its iPhone operating systems, introduced to certain iPhones in iOS updates 10.2.1 and 11.2. The claims seek monetary damages and other non-monetary relief. On April 5, 2018, several U.S. federal actions were consolidated through a Multidistrict Litigation process into a single action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the “Northern California District Court”). On February 28, 2020, the parties in the Multidistrict Litigation reached a settlement to resolve the U.S. federal and California state class actions. Under the terms of the settlement, which the Northern California District Court preliminarily approved in May 2020, the Company has agreed to pay up to $ 500 million in the aggregate to certain U.S. owners of iPhones if certain conditions are met. The final amount of the settlement will be determined based on the number of consumers who file valid claims and the attorneys’ fee award. However, the Company has agreed to pay at least $ 310 million to settle the claims. In addition to civil litigation, the Company is also responding to governmental investigations and requests for information relating to the performance management feature. The Company continues to believe that its iPhones were not defective, that the performance management feature introduced with iOS updates 10.2.1 and 11.2 was intended to, and did, improve customers’ user experience, and that the Company did not make any misleading statements or fail to disclose any material information. The Company has accrued its best estimate for the ultimate resolution of these matters. French Competition Authority On March 16, 2020, the French Competition Authority (“FCA”) announced its decision that aspects of the Company’s sales and distribution practices in France violate French competition law, and issued a fine of € 1.1 billion. The Company strongly disagrees with the FCA’s decision, and has appealed. Apple Inc. | Q3 2020 Form 10-Q | 21 Note 11 – Segment Information and Geographic Data The Company reports segment information based on the “management” approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company’s reportable segments. The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described in Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of the 2019 Form 10-K. The Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company’s retail stores located in those geographic locations. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the reportable segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as research and development, corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges and other separately managed general and administrative costs. The Company does not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes. The following table shows information by reportable segment for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 27, 2020 and June 29, 2019 (in millions): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended June 27, 2020 June 29, 2019 June 27, 2020 June 29, 2019 Americas: Net sales $ 27,018 $ 25,056 $ 93,858 $ 87,592 Operating income $ 7,974 $ 7,442 $ 28,327 $ 26,329 Europe: Net sales $ 14,173 $ 11,925 $ 51,740 $ 45,342 Operating income $ 4,420 $ 3,687 $ 16,667 $ 14,371 Greater China: Net sales $ 9,329 $ 9,157 $ 32,362 $ 32,544 Operating income $ 3,414 $ 3,221 $ 12,535 $ 12,142 Japan: Net sales $ 4,966 $ 4,082 $ 16,395 $ 16,524 Operating income $ 2,114 $ 1,795 $ 7,128 $ 7,199 Rest of Asia Pacific: Net sales $ 4,199 $ 3,589 $ 15,462 $ 14,132 Operating income $ 1,374 $ 1,155 $ 5,395 $ 4,811 Apple Inc. | Q3 2020 Form 10-Q | 22 A reconciliation of the Company’s segment operating income to the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 27, 2020 and June 29, 2019 is as follows (in millions): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended June 27, 2020 June 29, 2019 June 27, 2020 June 29, 2019 Segment operating income $ 19,296 $ 17,300 $ 70,052 $ 64,852 Research and development expense ( 4,758 ) ( 4,257 ) ( 13,774 ) ( 12,107 ) Other corporate expenses, net ( 1,447 ) ( 1,499 ) ( 4,765 ) ( 4,440 ) Total operating income $ 13,091 $ 11,544 $ 51,513 $ 48,305 Note 12 – Leases The Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including retail, corporate, manufacturing and data center space. These leases typically have original terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multi-year renewal options, some of which are reasonably certain of exercise. The Company’s lease arrangements may contain both lease and non-lease components. The Company has elected to combine and account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for leases of retail, corporate, and data center facilities. Payments under the Company’s lease arrangements may be fixed or variable, and variable lease payments are primarily based on purchases of output of the underlying leased assets. Lease costs associated with fixed payments on the Company’s operating leases were $ 381 million and $ 1.1 billion for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 27, 2020, respectively. Lease costs associated with variable payments on the Company’s leases were $ 1.8 billion and $ 6.6 billion f or the three- and nine-month periods ended June 27, 2020, respectively.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This section and other parts of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“Form 10-Q”) contain forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example, statements in this Form 10-Q regarding the potential future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s business and results of operations are forward-looking statements . Forward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as “future,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “predicts,” “will,” “would,” “could,” “can,” “may,” and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company’s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 28, 2019 (the “2019 Form 10-K”) and Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q, in each case under the heading “Risk Factors.” The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the 2019 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. All information presented herein is based on the Company’s fiscal calendar, and references to particular years, quarters, months or periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Each of the terms the “Company” and “Apple” as used herein refers collectively to Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, unless otherwise stated. The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law. Available Information The Company periodically provides certain information for investors on its corporate website, www.apple.com, and its investor relations website, investor.apple.com. This includes press releases and other information about financial performance, information on corporate governance and details related to the Company’s annual meeting of shareholders. The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form 10-Q is not incorporated by reference into this filing. Further, the Company’s references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only. Quarterly Highlights Business Seasonality and Product Introductions The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction. COVID-19 Update During the second quarter of 2020, a novel strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”) began spreading rapidly throughout the world, prompting governments and businesses to take unprecedented measures in response. Such measures included restrictions on travel and business operations, temporary closures of businesses, and quarantines and shelter-in-place orders. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets. The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have adversely affected and could in the future materially adversely impact the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. During the third quarter of 2020, aspects of the Company’s business continued to be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with many of the Company’s retail stores temporarily closed and the vast majority of the Company’s employees working remotely. The Company is working on safely re-opening its offices and retail stores, subject to local rules and regulations. Demand for certain of the Company’s products and services was impacted throughout the third quarter of 2020. The most pronounced impact occurred in April 2020, with demand improving in May and June 2020 across all product categories and Services. The full extent of the future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s operational and financial performance is currently uncertain and will depend on many factors outside the Company’s control, including, without limitation, the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic, the development and availability of effective treatments and vaccines, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products. Refer to Part I, Item 1A of the 2019 Form 10-K and Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q, in each case under the heading “Risk Factors,” for more information. Apple Inc. | Q3 2020 Form 10-Q | 25 The Company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, along with commercial paper and other short-term liquidity arrangements, will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital asset purchases, dividends, share repurchases, debt repayments and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations. Third Quarter Fiscal 2020 Highlights Total net sales increased 11% or $5.9 billion during the third quarter of 2020 compared to the same quarter in 2019, primarily driven by higher net sales of Services, iPad and Mac. The year-over-year increase in net sales during the third quarter of 2020 reflected growth in all of the Company’s geographic reportable segments and product categories. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable impact on net sales during the third quarter of 2020.

The Company’s effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2020 was lower compared to the third quarter of 2019 due primarily to higher tax benefits from share-based compensation. The Company’s effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2020 was lower compared to the same period in 2019 due primarily to the one-time adjustment of U.S. foreign tax credits in response to regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in December 2019 and lower taxes on foreign earnings, including the impact of tax settlements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Financial Instruments In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“ASU 2016-13”), which modifies the measurement of expected credit losses on certain financial instruments. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-13 in its first quarter of 2021 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. Based on the composition of the Company’s investment portfolio, current market conditions, and historical credit loss activity, the adoption of ASU 2016-13 is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

Actual results may differ from these estimates, and such differences may be material. Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of the 2019 Form 10-K, and “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in Part II, Item 7 of the 2019 Form 10-K describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements.

The remaining $74.4 billion in the table represents the amount available to repurchase shares under the authorized repurchase program as of June 27, 2020. The Company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. Under this program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act. (2) In November 2019, the Company entered into an ASR to purchase up to $10.0 billion of the Company’s common stock.

(3) In May 2020, the Company entered into a new ASR to purchase up to $6.0 billion of the Company’s common stock. In exchange for up-front payments totaling $6.0 billion, the financial institutions that are party to the arrangement committed to deliver shares to the Company during the ASR’s purchase period, which will end in or before August 2020. The total number of shares ultimately delivered, and therefore the average price paid per share, will be determined at the end of the applicable purchase period based on the volume-weighted average price of the Company’s common stock during that period.

Apple Inc. | Q2 2020 Form 10-Q | 5 Apple Inc. Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation and Preparation The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively “Apple” or the “Company”). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. In the opinion of the Company’s management, the condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation. These condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the Company’s annual consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2019 (the “ 2019 Form 10-K”). The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. A 14th week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. The Company’s fiscal years 2020 and 2019 span 52 weeks each. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Leases At the beginning of the first quarter of 2020, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (the “FASB”) Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (“ASU 2016-02”), and additional ASUs issued to clarify and update the guidance in ASU 2016-02 (collectively, the “new leases standard”), which modifies lease accounting for lessees to increase transparency and comparability by recording lease assets and liabilities for operating leases and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The Company adopted the new leases standard utilizing the modified retrospective transition method, under which amounts in prior periods presented were not restated. For contracts existing at the time of adoption, the Company elected to not reassess (i) whether any are or contain leases, (ii) lease classification, and (iii) initial direct costs. Upon adoption, the Company recorded $ 7.5 billion of right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and $ 8.1 billion of lease liabilities on its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. Hedging At the beginning of the first quarter of 2020, the Company adopted FASB ASU No. 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities (“ASU 2017-12”). ASU 2017-12 expands component and fair value hedging, specifies the presentation of the effects of hedging instruments, eliminates the separate measurement and presentation of hedge ineffectiveness, and updates disclosure requirements related to hedging. The Company adopted ASU 2017-12 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. Upon adoption, the Company recorded a $ 136 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (“AOCI”) and a corresponding decrease in retained earnings in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Shareholders’ Equity. Apple Inc. | Q2 2020 Form 10-Q | 6 Earnings Per Share The following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the three- and six-month periods ended March 28, 2020 and March 30, 2019 (net income in millions and shares in thousands): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended March 28, 2020 March 30, 2019 March 28, 2020 March 30, 2019 Numerator: Net income $ 11,249 $ 11,561 $ 33,485 $ 31,526 Denominator: Weighted-average basic shares outstanding 4,360,101 4,674,071 4,387,570 4,704,945 Effect of dilutive securities 44,590 26,575 42,078 32,004 Weighted-average diluted shares 4,404,691 4,700,646 4,429,648 4,736,949 Basic earnings per share $ 2.58 $ 2.47 $ 7.63 $ 6.70 Diluted earnings per share $ 2.55 $ 2.46 $ 7.56 $ 6.66 Potentially dilutive securities representing 31.1 million and 30.0 million shares of common stock were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for the three- and six-month periods ended March 30, 2019 , respectively, because their effect would have been antidilutive. Note 2 – Revenue Recognition Net sales consist of revenue from the sale of iPhone ® , Mac ® , iPad ® , Services and other products. The Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is transferred to its customers. Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company’s Products net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company’s Services net sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable. The Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer incentive programs based on the Company’s expectations and historical experience. For arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are capable of being distinct, the Company allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (“SSPs”). When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are established that reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company’s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation. The Company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud ® , Siri ® and Maps. The third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company’s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided. Cost of sales related to delivered hardware and bundled software, including estimated warranty costs, are recognized at the time of sale. Costs incurred to provide product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights are recognized as cost of sales as incurred. Apple Inc. | Q2 2020 Form 10-Q | 7 For certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For these arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized revenue, and has elected not to disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services. For the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products including, but not limited to, evaluating if it can establish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party applications sold through the App Store ® , Mac App Store, TV App Store and Watch App Store and certain digital content sold through the Company’s other digital content stores, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for such sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission it retains. The Company has elected to record revenue net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities, with the collected taxes recorded within other current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority. Deferred Revenue As of March 28, 2020 and September 28, 2019 , the Company had total deferred revenue of $ 9.4 billion and $ 8.1 billion , respectively. As of March 28, 2020 , the Company expects 63 % of total deferred revenue to be realized in less than a year, 28 % within one-to-two years, 7 % within two-to-three years and 2 % in greater than three years. Disaggregated Revenue Net sales disaggregated by significant products and services for the three- and six-month periods ended March 28, 2020 and March 30, 2019 were as follows (in millions): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended March 28, 2020 March 30, 2019 March 28, 2020 March 30, 2019 iPhone (1) $ 28,962 $ 31,051 $ 84,919 $ 83,033 Mac (1) 5,351 5,513 12,511 12,929 iPad (1) 4,368 4,872 10,345 11,601 Wearables, Home and Accessories (1)(2) 6,284 5,129 16,294 12,437 Services (3) 13,348 11,450 26,063 22,325 Total net sales (4) $ 58,313 $ 58,015 $ 150,132 $ 142,325 (1) Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are bundled in the sales price of the respective product.

(2) Level 2 fair value estimates are based on observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. (3) As of March 28, 2020 and September 28, 2019 , total marketable securities included $ 17.6 billion and $ 18.9 billion , respectively, that was restricted from general use, related to the State Aid Decision (refer to Note 5, “Income Taxes”) and other agreements. Additionally, as of March 28, 2020 , $ 2.6 billion of marketable securities were pledged as collateral under a repurchase agreement (refer to Note 6, “Debt”). Apple Inc. | Q2 2020 Form 10-Q | 9 The Company may sell certain of its marketable debt securities prior to their stated maturities for reasons including, but not limited to, managing liquidity, credit risk, duration and asset allocation. The maturities of the Company’s non-current marketable debt securities generally range from one to five years . The Company typically invests in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company’s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. Fair values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. When evaluating a marketable debt security for other-than-temporary impairment, the Company reviews factors such as the duration and extent to which the fair value of the security is less than its cost, the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto, and the Company’s intent to sell, or whether it will more likely than not be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. As of March 28, 2020 , the Company does not consider any of its marketable debt securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired. Non-Marketable Securities The Company holds non-marketable equity securities of certain privately held companies without readily determinable fair values. As of March 28, 2020 and September 28, 2019 , the Company’s non-marketable equity securities had a carrying value of $ 2.8 billion and $ 2.9 billion , respectively. Restricted Cash A reconciliation of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets to cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as of March 28, 2020 and September 28, 2019 is as follows (in millions): March 28, 2020 September 28, 2019 Cash and cash equivalents $ 40,174 $ 48,844 Restricted cash included in other current assets 1,077 23 Restricted cash included in other non-current assets 1,798 1,357 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 43,049 $ 50,224 The Company’s restricted cash primarily consisted of cash to support the Company’s iPhone Upgrade Program and certain partner agreements. Derivative Financial Instruments The Company may use derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risk on expected future cash flows, net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries, and certain existing assets and liabilities. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign currency exchange or interest rates. To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar may hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue, and subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar may hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries’ functional currencies. The Company may enter into forward contracts, option contracts or other instruments to manage this risk and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months . To protect the net investment in a foreign operation from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset a portion of the changes in the carrying amounts of these investments due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, the Company may use non-derivative financial instruments, such as its foreign currency–denominated debt, as hedges of its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries. In both of these cases, the Company designates these instruments as net investment hedges. Apple Inc. | Q2 2020 Form 10-Q | 10 To protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. These instruments may offset a portion of the foreign currency remeasurement gains or losses, or changes in fair value. The Company may designate these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of March 28, 2020 , the Company’s hedged term debt– and marketable securities–related foreign currency transactions are expected to be recognized within 22 years . The Company may also enter into non-designated foreign currency contracts to offset a portion of the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. To protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. These instruments may offset a portion of the changes in interest income or expense, or changes in fair value. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of March 28, 2020 , the Company’s hedged interest rate transactions are expected to be recognized within eight years . Cash Flow Hedges Cash flow hedge amounts that are included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in AOCI until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of foreign currency revenue are recognized as a component of net sales in the same period as the related revenue is recognized, and deferred gains and losses related to cash flow hedges of inventory purchases are recognized as a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related costs are recognized. Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of interest income or expense are recognized in other income/(expense), net (“OI&E”) in the same period as the related income or expense is recognized. Generally, for options designated as cash flow hedges, the time value is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognized in the financial statement line item to which the hedge relates on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in other comprehensive income/(loss) (“OCI”). Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially identified time period or within a subsequent two-month time period. Deferred gains and losses in AOCI associated with such derivative instruments are reclassified into OI&E in the period of de-designation. Any subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are reflected in OI&E unless they are re-designated as hedges of other transactions. Net Investment Hedges Net investment hedge amounts that are included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recorded in OCI as a part of the cumulative translation adjustment. For foreign exchange forward contracts designated as net investment hedges, the forward carry component is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognized in OCI on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OCI. Fair Value Hedges Fair value hedge gains and losses related to amounts that are included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in earnings along with a corresponding loss or gain related to the change in value of the hedged item in the same line in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. For foreign exchange forward contracts designated as fair value hedges, the forward carry component is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognized in OI&E on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OCI. Amounts excluded from the effectiveness assessment of fair value hedges and recognized in OI&E were gains of $ 126 million and $ 254 million for the three- and six-month periods ended March 28, 2020 , respectively. Non-Designated Derivatives Derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are adjusted to fair value through earnings in the financial statement line item to which the derivative relates. Apple Inc. | Q2 2020 Form 10-Q | 11 The Company records all derivatives in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The Company’s accounting treatment for these derivative instruments is based on its hedge designation. The following tables show the Company’s derivative instruments at gross fair value as of March 28, 2020 and September 28, 2019 (in millions): March 28, 2020 Fair Value of Derivatives Designated as Hedge Instruments Fair Value of Derivatives Not Designated as Hedge Instruments Total Fair Value Derivative assets (1) : Foreign exchange contracts $ 2,803 $ 1,425 $ 4,228 Interest rate contracts $ 1,709 $ — $ 1,709 Derivative liabilities (2) : Foreign exchange contracts $ 2,645 $ 1,518 $ 4,163 Interest rate contracts $ 66 $ — $ 66 September 28, 2019 Fair Value of Derivatives Designated as Hedge Instruments Fair Value of Derivatives Not Designated as Hedge Instruments Total Fair Value Derivative assets (1) : Foreign exchange contracts $ 1,798 $ 323 $ 2,121 Interest rate contracts $ 685 $ — $ 685 Derivative liabilities (2) : Foreign exchange contracts $ 1,341 $ 160 $ 1,501 Interest rate contracts $ 105 $ — $ 105 (1) The fair value of derivative assets is measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and is included in other current assets and other non-current assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The following tables show information about the Company’s derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges and the related hedged items for the three- and six-month periods ended March 28, 2020 and March 30, 2019 and as of March 28, 2020 (in millions): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended March 28, 2020 March 30, 2019 March 28, 2020 March 30, 2019 Gains/(Losses) on derivative instruments (1) : Foreign exchange contracts $ 436 $ 243 $ 253 $ 645 Interest rate contracts 1,290 465 1,128 1,122 Total $ 1,726 $ 708 $ 1,381 $ 1,767 Gains/(Losses) related to hedged items (1) : Marketable securities $ ( 436 ) $ ( 242 ) $ ( 253 ) $ ( 644 ) Fixed-rate debt ( 1,290 ) ( 465 ) ( 1,128 ) ( 1,122 ) Total $ ( 1,726 ) $ ( 707 ) $ ( 1,381 ) $ ( 1,766 ) Apple Inc. | Q2 2020 Form 10-Q | 13 March 28, 2020 Carrying amounts of hedged assets/(liabilities): Marketable securities (2) $ 15,080 Fixed-rate debt (3) $ ( 27,439 ) Cumulative hedging adjustments included in the carrying amounts of hedged items: Marketable securities carrying amount increases/(decreases) $ ( 877 ) Fixed-rate debt carrying amount (increases)/decreases $ ( 1,708 ) (1) Gains and losses related to fair value hedges are included in OI&E in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. (2) The carrying amounts of marketable securities that are designated as hedged items in fair value hedges are included in current marketable securities and non-current marketable securities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. (3) The carrying amounts of fixed-rate debt instruments that are designated as hedged items in fair value hedges are included in current term debt and non-current term debt in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. The following table shows the notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments and credit risk amounts associated with outstanding or unsettled derivative instruments as of March 28, 2020 and September 28, 2019 (in millions): March 28, 2020 September 28, 2019 Notional Amount Credit Risk Amount Notional Amount Credit Risk Amount Instruments designated as accounting hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ 59,198 $ 2,803 $ 61,795 $ 1,798 Interest rate contracts $ 27,350 $ 1,709 $ 31,250 $ 685 Instruments not designated as accounting hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ 91,165 $ 1,425 $ 76,868 $ 323 The notional amounts for outstanding derivative instruments provide one measure of the transaction volume outstanding and do not represent the amount of the Company’s exposure to credit or market loss. The credit risk amounts represent the Company’s gross exposure to potential accounting loss on derivative instruments that are outstanding or unsettled if all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current currency or interest rates at each respective date. The Company’s exposure to credit loss and market risk will vary over time as currency and interest rates change. Although the table above reflects the notional and credit risk amounts of the Company’s derivative instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses associated with the exposures and transactions that the instruments are intended to hedge. The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments. The Company generally enters into master netting arrangements, which are designed to reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. The Company presents its derivative assets and derivative liabilities at their gross fair values in its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of March 28, 2020 and September 28, 2019 , the net cash collateral received by the Company related to derivative instruments under its collateral security arrangements was $ 2.0 billion and $ 1.6 billion , respectively, which were included in other current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Under master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to the Company’s derivative contracts, the Company is allowed to net settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of March 28, 2020 and September 28, 2019 , the potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the Company’s derivative contracts, including the effects of collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $ 6.4 billion and $ 2.7 billion , respectively, resulting in net derivative liabilities of $ 279 million and $ 407 million , respectively. Apple Inc. | Q2 2020 Form 10-Q | 14 Accounts Receivable Trade Receivables The Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, resellers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral or third-party credit support in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements. As of both March 28, 2020 and September 28, 2019 , the Company had no customers that individually represented 10% or more of total trade receivables. The Company’s cellular network carriers accounted for 41 % and 51 % of total trade receivables as of March 28, 2020 and September 28, 2019 , respectively. Vendor Non-Trade Receivables The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. As of March 28, 2020 , the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 53 % and 16 % . As of September 28, 2019 , the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 59 % and 14 % . Note 4 – Condensed Consolidated Financial Statement Details The following tables show the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statement details as of March 28, 2020 and September 28, 2019 (in millions): Property, Plant and Equipment, Net March 28, 2020 September 28, 2019 Land and buildings $ 17,856 $ 17,085 Machinery, equipment and internal-use software 71,273 69,797 Leasehold improvements 9,614 9,075 Gross property, plant and equipment 98,743 95,957 Accumulated depreciation and amortization ( 62,854 ) ( 58,579 ) Total property, plant and equipment, net $ 35,889 $ 37,378 Other Non-Current Liabilities March 28, 2020 September 28, 2019 Long-term taxes payable $ 28,188 $ 29,545 Other non-current liabilities 28,607 20,958 Total other non-current liabilities $ 56,795 $ 50,503 Apple Inc. | Q2 2020 Form 10-Q | 15 Other Income/(Expense), Net The following table shows the detail of OI&E for the three- and six-month periods ended March 28, 2020 and March 30, 2019 (in millions): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended March 28, 2020 March 30, 2019 March 28, 2020 March 30, 2019 Interest and dividend income $ 1,049 $ 1,358 $ 2,094 $ 2,665 Interest expense ( 757 ) ( 1,010 ) ( 1,542 ) ( 1,900 ) Other income/(expense), net ( 10 ) 30 79 173 Total other income/(expense), net $ 282 $ 378 $ 631 $ 938 Note 5 – Income Taxes Uncertain Tax Positions As of March 28, 2020 , the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $ 16.7 billion , of which $ 8.9 billion , if recognized, would impact the Company’s effective tax rate. The Company had accrued $ 1.3 billion of gross interest and penalties related to income tax matters as of March 28, 2020 . The Company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and many state and foreign jurisdictions. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service concluded its review of the years 2013 through 2015 in 2018, and all years before 2016 are closed. Tax years after 2014 remain open in certain major foreign jurisdictions and are subject to examination by the taxing authorities. The Company believes that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Company’s tax audits are resolved in a manner inconsistent with its expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs. Although the timing of resolution and/or closure of audits is not certain, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that its gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease in the next 12 months by as much as $ 2.3 billion . European Commission State Aid Decision On August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company (the “State Aid Decision”). The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. The recovery amount was calculated to be € 13.1 billion , plus interest of € 1.2 billion . On an annual basis, the Company may request approval from the Irish Minister for Finance to reduce the recovery amount for certain taxes paid to other countries. As of March 28, 2020 , the adjusted recovery amount was € 12.9 billion , excluding interest. Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The Company believes the State Aid Decision to be without merit and appealed to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union. Ireland has also appealed the State Aid Decision. The Company believes that any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision would be creditable against U.S. taxes, subject to any foreign tax credit limitations in the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The adjusted recovery amount plus interest is funded into escrow, where it will remain restricted from general use pending the conclusion of all appeals.

Apple Inc. | Q2 2020 Form 10-Q | 16 Note 6 – Debt Commercial Paper and Repurchase Agreement The Company issues unsecured short-term promissory notes (“Commercial Paper”) pursuant to a commercial paper program. The Company uses net proceeds from the commercial paper program for general corporate purposes, including dividends and share repurchases. As of March 28, 2020 and September 28, 2019 , the Company had $ 7.5 billion and $ 6.0 billion of Commercial Paper outstanding, respectively, with maturities generally less than nine months . The weighted-average interest rate of the Company’s Commercial Paper was 1.39 % and 2.24 % as of March 28, 2020 and September 28, 2019 , respectively. The following table provides a summary of cash flows associated with the issuance and maturities of Commercial Paper for the six months ended March 28, 2020 and March 30, 2019 (in millions): Six Months Ended March 28, 2020 March 30, 2019 Maturities 90 days or less: Proceeds from/(Repayments of) commercial paper, net $ 1,377 $ ( 2,484 ) Maturities greater than 90 days: Proceeds from commercial paper 4,797 10,235 Repayments of commercial paper ( 4,656 ) ( 7,787 ) Proceeds from commercial paper, net 141 2,448 Total proceeds from/(repayments of) commercial paper, net $ 1,518 $ ( 36 ) In the second quarter of 2020, the Company entered into an agreement to sell certain of its marketable securities with a promise to repurchase the securities at a specified time and amount (“Repo”). Due to the Company’s continuing involvement with the marketable securities, the Company accounts for the Repo as a collateralized borrowing. As of March 28, 2020 , the Company had a $ 2.6 billion Repo liability with a maturity of less than six months , and had pledged $ 2.6 billion of marketable securities as collateral. Term Debt As of March 28, 2020 , the Company had outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $ 98.0 billion (collectively the “Notes”). The Notes are senior unsecured obligations and interest is payable in arrears. The following table provides a summary of the Company’s term debt as of March 28, 2020 and September 28, 2019 : Maturities (calendar year) March 28, 2020 September 28, 2019 Amount (in millions) Effective Interest Rate Amount (in millions) Effective Interest Rate 2013 – 2019 debt issuances: Floating-rate notes 2020 – 2022 $ 3,250 1.80 % – 2.81 % $ 4,250 2.25 % – 3.28 % Fixed-rate 0.350% – 4.650% notes 2020 – 2049 92,554 0.28 % – 4.78 % 97,429 0.28 % – 4.78 % First quarter 2020 debt issuance of €2.0 billion: Fixed-rate 0.000% – 0.500% notes 2025 – 2031 2,164 0.03 % – 0.56 % — — % Total term debt 97,968 101,679 Unamortized premium/(discount) and issuance costs, net ( 220 ) ( 224 ) Hedge accounting fair value adjustments 1,730 612 Less: Current portion of term debt ( 10,392 ) ( 10,260 ) Total non-current portion of term debt $ 89,086 $ 91,807 To manage interest rate risk on certain of its U.S. dollar–denominated fixed- or floating-rate notes, the Company has entered into interest rate swaps to effectively convert the fixed interest rates to floating interest rates or the floating interest rates to fixed interest rates on a portion of these notes. Additionally, to manage foreign currency risk on certain of its foreign currency–denominated notes, the Company has entered into foreign currency swaps to effectively convert these notes to U.S. dollar–denominated notes. Apple Inc. | Q2 2020 Form 10-Q | 17 A portion of the Company’s Japanese yen–denominated notes is designated as a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of the Company’s net investment in a foreign operation. As of March 28, 2020 and September 28, 2019 , the carrying value of the debt designated as a net investment hedge was $ 663 million and $ 1.0 billion , respectively. For further discussion regarding the Company’s use of derivative instruments, refer to the Derivative Financial Instruments section of Note 3, “Financial Instruments.” The effective interest rates for the Notes include the interest on the Notes, amortization of the discount or premium and, if applicable, adjustments related to hedging. The Company recognized $ 725 million and $ 1.5 billion of interest cost on its term debt for the three- and six-month periods ended March 28, 2020 , respectively. The Company recognized $ 828 million and $ 1.6 billion of interest cost on its term debt for the three- and six-month periods ended March 30, 2019 , respectively. As of March 28, 2020 and September 28, 2019 , the fair value of the Company’s Notes, based on Level 2 inputs, was $ 105.6 billion and $ 107.5 billion , respectively. Note 7 – Shareholders’ Equity As of March 28, 2020 , the Company was authorized to purchase up to $ 175 billion of the Company’s common stock under a share repurchase program, of which $ 134.6 billion had been utilized. During the six months ended March 28, 2020 , the Company repurchased 135.0 million shares of its common stock for $ 38.5 billion , including 30.4 million shares initially delivered under a $ 10.0 billion accelerated share repurchase arrangement (“ASR”) dated November 2019. On April 30, 2020 , the Company announced the Board of Directors increased the share repurchase program authorization by $ 50 billion . The Company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. Under this program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Under the Company’s ASR, financial institutions deliver shares of the Company’s common stock during the purchase period in exchange for an up-front payment. The total number of shares ultimately delivered under the ASR, and therefore the average repurchase price paid per share, is determined based on the volume-weighted average price of the Company’s common stock during the purchase period, which will end in May 2020. The shares received are retired in the periods they are delivered, and the up-front payment is accounted for as a reduction to retained earnings in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Statement of Shareholders’ Equity in the period the payment is made. Note 8 – Comprehensive Income The Company’s OCI consists of foreign currency translation adjustments from those subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, net deferred gains and losses on certain derivative instruments accounted for as hedges, and unrealized gains and losses on marketable debt securities classified as available-for-sale. The following table shows the pre-tax amounts reclassified from AOCI into the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, and the associated financial statement line items, for the three- and six-month periods ended March 28, 2020 and March 30, 2019 (in millions): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended Comprehensive Income Components Financial Statement Line Items March 28, 2020 March 30, 2019 March 28, 2020 March 30, 2019 Unrealized (gains)/losses on derivative instruments: Foreign exchange contracts Total net sales $ 34 $ ( 97 ) $ ( 63 ) $ ( 34 ) Total cost of sales 12 ( 76 ) ( 159 ) ( 451 ) Other income/(expense), net 771 52 548 448 Interest rate contracts Other income/(expense), net 1 2 3 3 818 ( 119 ) 329 ( 34 ) Unrealized (gains)/losses on marketable debt securities Other income/(expense), net 37 36 24 83 Total amounts reclassified from AOCI $ 855 $ ( 83 ) $ 353 $ 49 Apple Inc. | Q2 2020 Form 10-Q | 18 The following table shows the changes in AOCI by component for the six months ended March 28, 2020 (in millions): Cumulative Foreign Currency Translation Unrealized Gains/Losses on Derivative Instruments Unrealized Gains/Losses on Marketable Debt Securities Total Balances as of September 28, 2019 $ ( 1,463 ) $ 172 $ 707 $ ( 584 ) Other comprehensive income/(loss) before reclassifications ( 356 ) ( 151 ) ( 2,860 ) ( 3,367 ) Amounts reclassified from AOCI — 329 24 353 Tax effect ( 8 ) 26 655 673 Other comprehensive income/(loss) ( 364 ) 204 ( 2,181 ) ( 2,341 ) Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle (1) — 136 — 136 Balances as of March 28, 2020 $ ( 1,827 ) $ 512 $ ( 1,474 ) $ ( 2,789 ) (1) Refer to Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” for more information on the Company’s adoption of ASU 2017-12 at the beginning of the first quarter of 2020. Note 9 – Benefit Plans Stock Plans The Company had 193.7 million shares reserved for future issuance under its stock plans as of March 28, 2020 . Restricted stock units (“RSUs”) granted under the Company’s stock plans generally vest over four years , based on continued employment, and are settled upon vesting in shares of the Company’s common stock on a one -for-one basis. RSUs granted under the Company’s stock plans reduce the number of shares available for grant under the plans by a factor of two times the number of RSUs granted. RSUs canceled and shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations increase the number of shares available for grant under the plans utilizing a factor of two times the number of RSUs canceled or shares withheld. Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans During the three months ended March 28, 2020 , Section 16 officers Timothy D. Cook, Chris Kondo, Luca Maestri, Deirdre O’Brien and Jeffrey Williams had equity trading plans in place in accordance with Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) under the Exchange Act. An equity trading plan is a written document that pre-establishes the amounts, prices and dates (or formula for determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of the Company’s stock, including shares acquired under the Company’s employee and director equity plans. Restricted Stock Units A summary of the Company’s RSU activity and related information for the six months ended March 28, 2020 is as follows: Number of RSUs (in thousands) Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value Per RSU Aggregate Fair Value (in millions) Balance as of September 28, 2019 81,517 $ 169.18 RSUs granted 35,639 $ 225.14 RSUs vested ( 19,660 ) $ 151.02 RSUs canceled ( 2,316 ) $ 187.21 Balance as of March 28, 2020 95,180 $ 193.45 $ 23,580 The fair value as of the respective vesting dates of RSUs was $ 558 million and $ 4.8 billion for the three- and six-month periods ended March 28, 2020 , respectively, and was $ 348 million and $ 4.4 billion for the three- and six-month periods ended March 30, 2019 , respectively. Apple Inc. | Q2 2020 Form 10-Q | 19 Share-Based Compensation The following table shows share-based compensation expense and the related income tax benefit included in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three- and six-month periods ended March 28, 2020 and March 30, 2019 (in millions): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended March 28, 2020 March 30, 2019 March 28, 2020 March 30, 2019 Share-based compensation expense $ 1,697 $ 1,514 $ 3,407 $ 3,073 Income tax benefit related to share-based compensation expense $ ( 444 ) $ ( 331 ) $ ( 1,202 ) $ ( 1,081 ) As of March 28, 2020 , the total unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding RSUs and stock options was $ 14.5 billion , which the Company expects to recognize over a weighted-average period of 2.8 years . Note 10 – Commitments and Contingencies Accrued Warranty and Guarantees The following table shows changes in the Company’s accrued warranties and related costs for the three- and six-month periods ended March 28, 2020 and March 30, 2019 (in millions): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended March 28, 2020 March 30, 2019 March 28, 2020 March 30, 2019 Beginning accrued warranty and related costs $ 3,873 $ 3,819 $ 3,570 $ 3,692 Cost of warranty claims ( 689 ) ( 915 ) ( 1,604 ) ( 1,911 ) Accruals for product warranty 739 583 1,957 1,706 Ending accrued warranty and related costs $ 3,923 $ 3,487 $ 3,923 $ 3,487 The Company offers an iPhone Upgrade Program, which is available to customers who purchase a qualifying iPhone in the U.S., the U.K. and mainland China. The iPhone Upgrade Program provides customers the right to trade in that iPhone for a specified amount when purchasing a new iPhone, provided certain conditions are met. The Company accounts for the trade-in right as a guarantee liability and recognizes arrangement revenue net of the fair value of such right, with subsequent changes to the guarantee liability recognized within net sales. Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product Although most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets and other electronic devices. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements. The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Substantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia, with some Mac computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland. Apple Inc. | Q2 2020 Form 10-Q | 20 Unconditional Purchase Obligations The Company has entered into certain off–balance sheet commitments that require the future purchase of goods or services (“unconditional purchase obligations”). The Company’s unconditional purchase obligations primarily consist of payments for supplier arrangements, Internet and telecommunication services, intellectual property licenses and content creation. As of March 28, 2020 , the Company’s total future payments under noncancelable unconditional purchase obligations having a remaining term in excess of one year were $ 9.9 billion . Contingencies The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully resolved. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims, except for the following matters: VirnetX VirnetX, Inc. (“VirnetX”) filed two lawsuits in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas (the “Eastern Texas District Court”) against the Company alleging that certain Company products infringe four patents (the “VirnetX Patents”) relating to network communications technology (“VirnetX I” and “VirnetX II”). On September 30, 2016, a jury returned a verdict in VirnetX I against the Company and awarded damages of $ 302 million , which later increased to $ 440 million in post-trial proceedings. The Company appealed the VirnetX I verdict to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (the “Federal Circuit”). On April 11, 2018, a jury returned a verdict in VirnetX II against the Company and awarded damages of $ 503 million . The Company appealed the VirnetX II verdict to the Federal Circuit, and on November 22, 2019, the Federal Circuit affirmed-in-part, reversed-in-part, and remanded VirnetX II back to the Eastern Texas District Court. The Company has challenged the validity of the VirnetX Patents at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the “PTO”). In response, the PTO has declared the VirnetX Patents invalid. VirnetX appealed the invalidity decision of the PTO to the Federal Circuit. The Federal Circuit consolidated the Company’s appeal of the Eastern Texas District Court VirnetX I verdict and VirnetX’s appeals from the PTO invalidity proceedings. On January 15, 2019, the Federal Circuit affirmed the VirnetX I verdict, which the Company subsequently paid, including damages and interest. On July 8, 2019, the Federal Circuit remanded one of VirnetX’s two appeals of the PTO’s invalidity decisions back to the PTO for further proceedings. On August 1, 2019, the Federal Circuit affirmed-in-part, vacated-in-part, and remanded back to the PTO portions of VirnetX’s second appeal. iOS Performance Management Cases Various civil litigation matters have been filed in state and federal courts in the U.S. and in various international jurisdictions alleging violation of consumer protection laws, fraud, computer intrusion and other causes of action related to the Company’s performance management feature used in its iPhone operating systems, introduced to certain iPhones in iOS updates 10.2.1 and 11.2. The claims seek monetary damages and other non-monetary relief. On April 5, 2018, several U.S. federal actions were consolidated through a Multidistrict Litigation process into a single action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the “Northern California District Court”). On February 28, 2020, the parties in the Multidistrict Litigation reached a settlement to resolve the U.S. federal and California state class actions. Under the terms of the settlement, which is subject to the Northern California District Court’s approval, the Company has agreed to pay up to $ 500 million in the aggregate to certain U.S. owners of iPhones if certain conditions are met. The final amount of the settlement will be determined based on the number of consumers who file valid claims and the attorneys’ fee award. However, the Company has agreed to pay at least $ 310 million to settle the claims. In addition to civil litigation, the Company is also responding to governmental investigations and requests for information relating to the performance management feature. The Company continues to believe that its iPhones were not defective, that the performance management feature introduced with iOS updates 10.2.1 and 11.2 was intended to, and did, improve customers’ user experience, and that the Company did not make any misleading statements or fail to disclose any material information. The Company has accrued its best estimate for the ultimate resolution of these matters. French Competition Authority On March 16, 2020, the French Competition Authority (“FCA”) announced its decision that aspects of the Company’s sales and distribution practices in France violate French competition law, and issued a fine of € 1.1 billion . The Company strongly disagrees with the FCA’s decision, and plans to appeal. Apple Inc. | Q2 2020 Form 10-Q | 21 Note 11 – Segment Information and Geographic Data The Company reports segment information based on the “management” approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company’s reportable segments. The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described in Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of the 2019 Form 10-K. The Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company’s retail stores located in those geographic locations. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the reportable segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as research and development, corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges and other separately managed general and administrative costs. The Company does not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes. The following table shows information by reportable segment for the three- and six-month periods ended March 28, 2020 and March 30, 2019 (in millions): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended March 28, 2020 March 30, 2019 March 28, 2020 March 30, 2019 Americas: Net sales $ 25,473 $ 25,596 $ 66,840 $ 62,536 Operating income $ 7,261 $ 7,687 $ 20,353 $ 18,887 Europe: Net sales $ 14,294 $ 13,054 $ 37,567 $ 33,417 Operating income $ 4,528 $ 4,026 $ 12,247 $ 10,684 Greater China: Net sales $ 9,455 $ 10,218 $ 23,033 $ 23,387 Operating income $ 3,758 $ 3,607 $ 9,121 $ 8,921 Japan: Net sales $ 5,206 $ 5,532 $ 11,429 $ 12,442 Operating income $ 2,236 $ 2,390 $ 5,014 $ 5,404 Rest of Asia Pacific: Net sales $ 3,885 $ 3,615 $ 11,263 $ 10,543 Operating income $ 1,290 $ 1,096 $ 4,021 $ 3,656 Apple Inc. | Q2 2020 Form 10-Q | 22 A reconciliation of the Company’s segment operating income to the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three- and six-month periods ended March 28, 2020 and March 30, 2019 is as follows (in millions): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended March 28, 2020 March 30, 2019 March 28, 2020 March 30, 2019 Segment operating income $ 19,073 $ 18,806 $ 50,756 $ 47,552 Research and development expense ( 4,565 ) ( 3,948 ) ( 9,016 ) ( 7,850 ) Other corporate expenses, net ( 1,655 ) ( 1,443 ) ( 3,318 ) ( 2,941 ) Total operating income $ 12,853 $ 13,415 $ 38,422 $ 36,761 Note 12 – Leases The Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including retail, corporate, manufacturing and data center space. These leases typically have original terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multi-year renewal options, some of which are reasonably certain of exercise. The Company’s lease arrangements may contain both lease and non-lease components. The Company has elected to combine and account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for leases of retail, corporate, and data center facilities. Payments under the Company’s lease arrangements may be fixed or variable, and variable lease payments are primarily based on purchases of output of the underlying leased assets. Lease costs associated with fixed payments on the Company’s operating leases were $ 363 million and $ 732 million for the three- and six-month periods ended March 28, 2020 , respectively. Lease costs associated with variable payments on the Company’s leases were $ 1.9 billion and $ 4.8 billion for the three- and six-month periods ended March 28, 2020 , respectively. For the three- and six-month periods ended March 28, 2020 , the Company made $ 353 million and $ 702 million of fixed cash payments related to operating leases, respectively. Non-cash activities involving ROU assets obtained in exchange for lease liabilities were $ 1.2 billion and $ 9.3 billion for the three- and six-month periods ended March 28, 2020 , respectively, including the impact of adopting the new leases standard in the first quarter of 2020. The following table shows ROU assets and lease liabilities, and the associated financial statement line items, as of March 28, 2020 (in millions): Lease-Related Assets and Liabilities Financial Statement Line Items March 28, 2020 Right-of-use assets: Operating leases Other non-current assets $ 8,097 Finance leases Property, plant and equipment, net 631 Total right-of-use assets $ 8,728 Lease liabilities: Operating leases Other current liabilities $ 1,185 Other non-current liabilities 7,421 Finance leases Other current liabilities 19 Other non-current liabilities 629 Total lease liabilities $ 9,254 Apple Inc. | Q2 2020 Form 10-Q | 23 Lease liability maturities as of March 28, 2020 , are as follows (in millions): Operating Leases Finance Leases Total 2020 (remaining six months) $ 559 $ 14 $ 573 2021 1,428 40 1,468 2022 1,298 38 1,336 2023 1,091 49 1,140 2024 951 26 977 Thereafter 4,269 920 5,189 Total undiscounted liabilities 9,596 1,087 10,683 Less: Imputed interest ( 990 ) ( 439 ) ( 1,429 ) Total lease liabilities $ 8,606 $ 648 $ 9,254 The weighted-average remaining lease term and discount rate related to the Company’s lease liabilities as of March 28, 2020 were 10.7 years and 2.2 % , respectively. The Company’s lease discount rates are generally based on estimates of its incremental borrowing rate, as the discount rates implicit in the Company’s leases cannot be readily determined. As of March 28, 2020 , the Company had $ 1.8 billion of future payments under additional leases, primarily for corporate facilities and retail space, that had not yet commenced. These leases will commence between 2020 and 2022, with lease terms ranging from less than 1 year to 21 years . Apple Inc. | Q2 2020 Form 10-Q | 24 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This section and other parts of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“Form 10-Q”) contain forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example, statements in this Form 10-Q regarding the potential future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s business and results of operations are forward-looking statements . Forward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as “future,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “predicts,” “will,” “would,” “could,” “can,” “may,” and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company’s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 28, 2019 (the “ 2019 Form 10-K”) and Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q, in each case under the heading “Risk Factors.” The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the 2019 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. All information presented herein is based on the Company’s fiscal calendar, and references to particular years, quarters, months or periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Each of the terms the “Company” and “Apple” as used herein refers collectively to Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, unless otherwise stated. The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law. Available Information The Company periodically provides certain information for investors on its corporate website, www.apple.com, and its investor relations website, investor.apple.com. This includes press releases and other information about financial performance, information on corporate governance and details related to the Company’s annual meeting of shareholders. The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form 10-Q is not incorporated by reference into this filing. Further, the Company’s references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only. Quarterly Highlights Business Seasonality and Product Introductions The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction. COVID-19 Update A novel strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”) has spread rapidly throughout the world, prompting governments and businesses to take unprecedented measures in response. Such measures have included restrictions on travel and business operations, temporary closures of businesses, and quarantines and shelter-in-place orders. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets. The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have adversely affected and could in the future materially adversely impact the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. During February 2020, following the initial outbreak of the virus in China, the Company experienced disruptions to its manufacturing, supply chain and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, resulting in temporary iPhone supply shortages that affected sales worldwide. Also, the Company’s sales of its products in China were adversely affected as public health measures and other actions to curb the spread of the virus, including the temporary closure of the Company’s retail stores and channel partner points of sale, were put in place. The virus spread further around the world as the quarter progressed, and social distancing measures and shelter-in-place orders were introduced in many countries. Effective March 13, 2020, the Company temporarily closed all of its retail stores outside of China. The Company has also required substantially all of its employees in all of its offices outside of China to work remotely. Additionally, many of the Company’s channel partner points of sale outside of China temporarily closed. As a result of the above factors, the Company also experienced weakened demand for its products and services outside of China during the last three weeks of the quarter. Apple Inc. | Q2 2020 Form 10-Q | 25 The COVID-19 pandemic has continued to adversely impact demand for certain of the Company’s products and services through April 2020. The full extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s operational and financial performance is currently uncertain and will depend on many factors outside the Company’s control, including, without limitation, the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic, the development and availability of effective treatments and vaccines, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products. See “ The Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price have been adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic ” in Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q under the heading “Risk Factors.” The Company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, along with commercial paper and other short-term liquidity arrangements, will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital asset purchases, dividends, share repurchases, debt repayments and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations.

Such measures have included restrictions on travel and business operations, temporary closures of businesses, and quarantines and shelter-in-place orders. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets. The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have adversely affected and could in the future materially adversely impact the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. During February 2020, following the initial outbreak of the virus in China, the Company experienced disruptions to its manufacturing, supply chain and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, resulting in temporary iPhone supply shortages that affected sales worldwide. Also, the Company’s sales of its products in China were adversely affected as public health measures and other actions to curb the spread of the virus, including the temporary closure of the Company’s retail stores and channel partner points of sale, were put in place. The virus spread further around the world as the quarter progressed, and social distancing measures and shelter-in-place orders were introduced in many countries. Effective March 13, 2020, the Company temporarily closed all of its retail stores outside of China. The Company has also required substantially all of its employees in all of its offices outside of China to work remotely. Additionally, many of the Company’s channel partner points of sale outside of China temporarily closed. As a result, the Company also experienced weakened demand for its products and services outside of China during the last three weeks of the quarter. The COVID-19 pandemic has continued to adversely impact demand for certain of the Company’s products and services through April 2020. The Company is continuing to monitor the situation and take appropriate actions in accordance with the recommendations and requirements of relevant authorities. The full extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s operational and financial performance is currently uncertain and will depend on many factors outside the Company’s control, including, without limitation, the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic, the development and availability of effective treatments and vaccines, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products. Additional future impacts on the Company may include, but are not limited to, material adverse effects on: demand for the Company’s products and services; the Company’s supply chain and sales and distribution channels; the Company’s ability to execute its strategic plans; and the Company’s profitability and cost structure. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in Part I, Item 1A of the 2019 Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.” Apple Inc. | Q2 2020 Form 10-Q | 34 Item 2.

Apple Inc. | Q1 2020 Form 10-Q | 5 Apple Inc. Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation and Preparation The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively “Apple” or the “Company”). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. In the opinion of the Company’s management, the condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. These condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the Company’s annual consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2019 (the “ 2019 Form 10-K”). The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. A 14th week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. The Company’s fiscal years 2020 and 2019 span 52 weeks each. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Leases At the beginning of the first quarter of 2020, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (the “FASB”) Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (“ASU 2016-02”), and additional ASUs issued to clarify and update the guidance in ASU 2016-02 (collectively, the “new leases standard”), which modifies lease accounting for lessees to increase transparency and comparability by recording lease assets and liabilities for operating leases and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The Company adopted the new leases standard utilizing the modified retrospective transition method, under which amounts in prior periods presented were not restated. For contracts existing at the time of adoption, the Company elected to not reassess (i) whether any are or contain leases, (ii) lease classification, and (iii) initial direct costs. Upon adoption, the Company recorded $ 7.5 billion of right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and $ 8.1 billion of lease liabilities on its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. Hedging At the beginning of the first quarter of 2020, the Company adopted FASB ASU No. 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities (“ASU 2017-12”). ASU 2017-12 expands component and fair value hedging, specifies the presentation of the effects of hedging instruments, eliminates the separate measurement and presentation of hedge ineffectiveness, and updates disclosure requirements related to hedging. The Company adopted ASU 2017-12 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. Upon adoption, the Company recorded a $ 136 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (“AOCI”) and a corresponding decrease in retained earnings in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Shareholders’ Equity. Apple Inc. | Q1 2020 Form 10-Q | 6 Earnings Per Share The following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the three months ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018 (net income in millions and shares in thousands): Three Months Ended December 28, 2019 December 29, 2018 Numerator: Net income $ 22,236 $ 19,965 Denominator: Weighted-average basic shares outstanding 4,415,040 4,735,820 Effect of dilutive securities 39,564 37,432 Weighted-average diluted shares 4,454,604 4,773,252 Basic earnings per share $ 5.04 $ 4.22 Diluted earnings per share $ 4.99 $ 4.18 Potentially dilutive securities representing 28.8 million shares of common stock were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for the three months ended December 29, 2018 , because their effect would have been antidilutive. Note 2 – Revenue Recognition Net sales consist of revenue from the sale of iPhone ® , Mac ® , iPad ® , Services and other products. The Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is transferred to its customers. Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company’s Products net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company’s Services net sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable. The Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer incentive programs based on the Company’s expectations and historical experience. For arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are capable of being distinct, the Company allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (“SSPs”). When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are established that reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company’s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation. The Company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud ® , Siri ® and Maps. The third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company’s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided. Cost of sales related to delivered hardware and bundled software, including estimated warranty costs, are recognized at the time of sale. Costs incurred to provide product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights are recognized as cost of sales as incurred. Apple Inc. | Q1 2020 Form 10-Q | 7 For certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For these arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized revenue, and has elected not to disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services. For the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products including, but not limited to, evaluating if it can establish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party applications sold through the App Store ® , Mac App Store, TV App Store and Watch App Store and certain digital content sold through the Company’s other digital content stores, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for such sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission it retains. The Company has elected to record revenue net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities, with the collected taxes recorded within other current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority. Deferred Revenue As of December 28, 2019 and September 28, 2019 , the Company had total deferred revenue of $ 9.1 billion and $ 8.1 billion , respectively. As of December 28, 2019 , the Company expects 61 % of total deferred revenue to be realized in less than a year, 29 % within one-to-two years, 8 % within two-to-three years and 2 % in greater than three years. Disaggregated Revenue Net sales disaggregated by significant products and services for the three months ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018 were as follows (in millions): Three Months Ended December 28, 2019 December 29, 2018 iPhone (1) $ 55,957 $ 51,982 Mac (1) 7,160 7,416 iPad (1) 5,977 6,729 Wearables, Home and Accessories (1)(2) 10,010 7,308 Services (3) 12,715 10,875 Total net sales (4) $ 91,819 $ 84,310 (1) Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are bundled in the sales price of the respective product. (2) Wearables, Home and Accessories net sales include sales of AirPods®, Apple TV®, Apple Watch®, Beats® products, HomePod™, iPod touch® and Apple-branded and third-party accessories. (3) Services net sales include sales from the Company’s digital content stores and streaming services, AppleCare®, licensing and other services. Services net sales also include amortization of the deferred value of Maps, Siri, and free iCloud and Apple TV + services, which are bundled in the sales price of certain products. (4) Includes $ 1.9 billion of revenue recognized in the three months ended December 28, 2019 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 28, 2019 and $ 2.4 billion of revenue recognized in the three months ended December 29, 2018 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 29, 2018 . The Company’s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable segment in Note 11, “Segment Information and Geographic Data” for the three months ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018 .

(3) As of December 28, 2019 and September 28, 2019 , total marketable securities included $ 19.1 billion and $ 18.9 billion , respectively, that was restricted from general use, related to the State Aid Decision (refer to Note 5, “Income Taxes”) and other agreements. Apple Inc. | Q1 2020 Form 10-Q | 9 The Company may sell certain of its marketable debt securities prior to their stated maturities for reasons including, but not limited to, managing liquidity, credit risk, duration and asset allocation. The maturities of the Company’s non-current marketable debt securities generally range from one to five years . The Company typically invests in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company’s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. Fair values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. When evaluating a marketable debt security for other-than-temporary impairment, the Company reviews factors such as the duration and extent to which the fair value of the security is less than its cost, the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto, and the Company’s intent to sell, or whether it will more likely than not be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. As of December 28, 2019 , the Company does not consider any of its marketable debt securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired. Non-Marketable Securities The Company holds non-marketable equity securities of certain privately held companies without readily determinable fair values. As of both December 28, 2019 and September 28, 2019 , the Company’s non-marketable equity securities had a carrying value of $ 2.9 billion . Restricted Cash A reconciliation of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets to cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as of December 28, 2019 and September 28, 2019 is as follows (in millions): December 28, 2019 September 28, 2019 Cash and cash equivalents $ 39,771 $ 48,844 Restricted cash included in other current assets 68 23 Restricted cash included in other non-current assets 1,826 1,357 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 41,665 $ 50,224 The Company’s restricted cash primarily consisted of cash required to be on deposit under a contractual agreement with a bank to support the Company’s iPhone Upgrade Program. Derivative Financial Instruments The Company may use derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risk on expected future cash flows, net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries, and certain existing assets and liabilities. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign currency exchange or interest rates. To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar may hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue, and subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar may hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries’ functional currencies. The Company may enter into forward contracts, option contracts or other instruments to manage this risk and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months . To protect the net investment in a foreign operation from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset a portion of the changes in the carrying amounts of these investments due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, the Company may use non-derivative financial instruments, such as its foreign currency–denominated debt, as hedges of its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries. In both of these cases, the Company designates these instruments as net investment hedges. Apple Inc. | Q1 2020 Form 10-Q | 10 To protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. These instruments may offset a portion of the foreign currency remeasurement gains or losses, or changes in fair value. The Company may designate these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of December 28, 2019 , the Company’s hedged term debt– and marketable securities–related foreign currency transactions are expected to be recognized within 23 years . The Company may also enter into non-designated foreign currency contracts to offset a portion of the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. To protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. These instruments may offset a portion of the changes in interest income or expense, or changes in fair value. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of December 28, 2019 , the Company’s hedged interest rate transactions are expected to be recognized within 8 years . Cash Flow Hedges Cash flow hedge amounts that are included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in AOCI until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of foreign currency revenue are recognized as a component of net sales in the same period as the related revenue is recognized, and deferred gains and losses related to cash flow hedges of inventory purchases are recognized as a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related costs are recognized. Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of interest income or expense are recognized in other income/(expense), net (“OI&E”) in the same period as the related income or expense is recognized. For options designated as cash flow hedges, the time value is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognized in the financial statement line item to which the hedge relates on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in other comprehensive income/(loss) (“OCI”). Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially identified time period or within a subsequent two-month time period. Deferred gains and losses in AOCI associated with such derivative instruments are reclassified into OI&E in the period of de-designation. Any subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are reflected in OI&E unless they are re-designated as hedges of other transactions. Net Investment Hedges Net investment hedge amounts that are included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recorded in OCI as a part of the cumulative translation adjustment. For foreign exchange forward contracts designated as net investment hedges, the forward carry component is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognized in OCI on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OCI. Fair Value Hedges Fair value hedge gains and losses related to amounts that are included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in earnings along with a corresponding loss or gain related to the change in value of the hedged item in the same line in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. For foreign exchange forward contracts designated as fair value hedges, the forward carry component is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognized in OI&E on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OCI. The amount excluded from the effectiveness assessment of fair value hedges and recognized in OI&E was a gain of $ 128 million for the three months ended December 28, 2019 . Non-Designated Derivatives Derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are adjusted to fair value through earnings in the financial statement line item to which the derivative relates. Apple Inc. | Q1 2020 Form 10-Q | 11 The Company records all derivatives in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The Company’s accounting treatment for these derivative instruments is based on its hedge designation. The following tables show the Company’s derivative instruments at gross fair value as of December 28, 2019 and September 28, 2019 (in millions): December 28, 2019 Fair Value of Derivatives Designated as Hedge Instruments Fair Value of Derivatives Not Designated as Hedge Instruments Total Fair Value Derivative assets (1) : Foreign exchange contracts $ 1,625 $ 327 $ 1,952 Interest rate contracts $ 475 $ — $ 475 Derivative liabilities (2) : Foreign exchange contracts $ 964 $ 494 $ 1,458 Interest rate contracts $ 57 $ — $ 57 September 28, 2019 Fair Value of Derivatives Designated as Hedge Instruments Fair Value of Derivatives Not Designated as Hedge Instruments Total Fair Value Derivative assets (1) : Foreign exchange contracts $ 1,798 $ 323 $ 2,121 Interest rate contracts $ 685 $ — $ 685 Derivative liabilities (2) : Foreign exchange contracts $ 1,341 $ 160 $ 1,501 Interest rate contracts $ 105 $ — $ 105 (1) The fair value of derivative assets is measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and is included in other current assets and other non-current assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. (2) The fair value of derivative liabilities is measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and is included in other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company classifies cash flows related to derivative financial instruments as operating activities in its Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The following table shows the pre-tax gains and losses of the Company’s derivative and non-derivative instruments designated as cash flow and net investment hedges in OCI and the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three months ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018 (in millions): Three Months Ended December 28, 2019 December 29, 2018 Gains/(Losses) recognized in OCI – included in effectiveness assessment: Cash flow hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ 271 $ ( 478 ) Net investment hedges: Foreign currency debt $ 24 $ ( 16 ) Gains/(Losses) reclassified from AOCI into net income – included in effectiveness assessment: Cash flow hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ 491 $ ( 118 ) Interest rate contracts ( 2 ) ( 1 ) Total $ 489 $ ( 119 ) Apple Inc. | Q1 2020 Form 10-Q | 12 The amount excluded from the effectiveness assessment of the Company’s hedges and recognized in OCI was a loss of $ 89 million for the three months ended December 28, 2019 . The following tables show information about the Company’s derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges and the related hedged items for the three months ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018 and as of December 28, 2019 (in millions): Three Months Ended December 28, 2019 December 29, 2018 Gains/(Losses) on derivative instruments (1) : Foreign exchange contracts $ ( 183 ) $ 402 Interest rate contracts ( 162 ) 657 Total $ ( 345 ) $ 1,059 Gains/(Losses) related to hedged items (1) : Marketable securities $ 183 $ ( 402 ) Fixed-rate debt 162 ( 657 ) Total $ 345 $ ( 1,059 ) December 28, 2019 Carrying amounts of hedged assets/(liabilities): Marketable securities (2) $ 15,544 Fixed-rate debt (3) $ ( 28,631 ) Cumulative hedging adjustments included in the carrying amounts of hedged items: Marketable securities carrying amount increases/(decreases) $ ( 594 ) Fixed-rate debt carrying amount (increases)/decreases $ ( 418 ) (1) Gains and losses related to fair value hedges are included in OI&E in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. (2) The carrying amounts of marketable securities that are designated as hedged items in fair value hedges are included in current marketable securities and non-current marketable securities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. (3) The carrying amounts of fixed-rate debt instruments that are designated as hedged items in fair value hedges are included in current term debt and non-current term debt in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. The following table shows the notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments and credit risk amounts associated with outstanding or unsettled derivative instruments as of December 28, 2019 and September 28, 2019 (in millions): December 28, 2019 September 28, 2019 Notional Amount Credit Risk Amount Notional Amount Credit Risk Amount Instruments designated as accounting hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ 54,215 $ 1,625 $ 61,795 $ 1,798 Interest rate contracts $ 28,250 $ 475 $ 31,250 $ 685 Instruments not designated as accounting hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ 96,470 $ 327 $ 76,868 $ 323 Apple Inc. | Q1 2020 Form 10-Q | 13 The notional amounts for outstanding derivative instruments provide one measure of the transaction volume outstanding and do not represent the amount of the Company’s exposure to credit or market loss. The credit risk amounts represent the Company’s gross exposure to potential accounting loss on derivative instruments that are outstanding or unsettled if all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current currency or interest rates at each respective date. The Company’s exposure to credit loss and market risk will vary over time as currency and interest rates change. Although the table above reflects the notional and credit risk amounts of the Company’s derivative instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses associated with the exposures and transactions that the instruments are intended to hedge. The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments. The Company generally enters into master netting arrangements, which are designed to reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. The Company presents its derivative assets and derivative liabilities at their gross fair values in its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 28, 2019 and September 28, 2019 , the net cash collateral received by the Company related to derivative instruments under its collateral security arrangements was $ 1.0 billion and $ 1.6 billion , respectively, which were included in other current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Under master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to the Company’s derivative contracts, the Company is allowed to net settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of December 28, 2019 and September 28, 2019 , the potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the Company’s derivative contracts, including the effects of collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $ 2.4 billion and $ 2.7 billion , respectively, resulting in net derivative liabilities of $ 128 million and $ 407 million , respectively. Accounts Receivable Trade Receivables The Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, resellers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral or third-party credit support in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements. As of both December 28, 2019 and September 28, 2019 , the Company had no customers that individually represented 10% or more of total trade receivables. The Company’s cellular network carriers accounted for 43 % and 51 % of total trade receivables as of December 28, 2019 and September 28, 2019 , respectively. Vendor Non-Trade Receivables The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. As of December 28, 2019 , the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 56 % and 17 % . As of September 28, 2019 , the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 59 % and 14 % . Apple Inc. | Q1 2020 Form 10-Q | 14 Note 4 – Condensed Consolidated Financial Statement Details The following tables show the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statement details as of December 28, 2019 and September 28, 2019 (in millions): Property, Plant and Equipment, Net December 28, 2019 September 28, 2019 Land and buildings $ 17,754 $ 17,085 Machinery, equipment and internal-use software 70,841 69,797 Leasehold improvements 9,395 9,075 Gross property, plant and equipment 97,990 95,957 Accumulated depreciation and amortization ( 60,959 ) ( 58,579 ) Total property, plant and equipment, net $ 37,031 $ 37,378 Other Non-Current Liabilities December 28, 2019 September 28, 2019 Long-term taxes payable $ 28,198 $ 29,545 Other non-current liabilities 27,650 20,958 Total other non-current liabilities $ 55,848 $ 50,503 Other Income/(Expense), Net The following table shows the detail of OI&E for the three months ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018 (in millions): Three Months Ended December 28, 2019 December 29, 2018 Interest and dividend income $ 1,045 $ 1,307 Interest expense ( 785 ) ( 890 ) Other income, net 89 143 Total other income/(expense), net $ 349 $ 560 Note 5 – Income Taxes Uncertain Tax Positions As of December 28, 2019 , the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $ 16.4 billion , of which $ 8.9 billion , if recognized, would impact the Company’s effective tax rate. The Company had accrued $ 1.5 billion of gross interest and penalties related to income tax matters as of December 28, 2019 . The Company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and many state and foreign jurisdictions. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service concluded its review of the years 2013 through 2015 in 2018, and all years before 2016 are closed. Tax years after 2014 remain open in certain major foreign jurisdictions and are subject to examination by the taxing authorities. The Company believes that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Company’s tax audits are resolved in a manner inconsistent with its expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs. Although the timing of resolution and/or closure of audits is not certain, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that its gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease in the next 12 months by as much as $ 2.3 billion . Apple Inc. | Q1 2020 Form 10-Q | 15 European Commission State Aid Decision On August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company (the “State Aid Decision”). The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. The recovery amount was calculated to be € 13.1 billion , plus interest of € 1.2 billion . On an annual basis, the Company may request approval from the Irish Minister for Finance to reduce the recovery amount for certain taxes paid to other countries. As of December 28, 2019 , the adjusted recovery amount was € 12.9 billion . Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The Company believes the State Aid Decision to be without merit and appealed to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union. Ireland has also appealed the State Aid Decision. The Company believes that any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision would be creditable against U.S. taxes, subject to any foreign tax credit limitations in the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The adjusted recovery amount plus interest is funded into escrow, where it will remain restricted from general use pending the conclusion of all appeals. Refer to the Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities section of Note 3, “Financial Instruments” for more information. Note 6 – Debt Commercial Paper The Company issues unsecured short-term promissory notes (“Commercial Paper”) pursuant to a commercial paper program. The Company uses net proceeds from the commercial paper program for general corporate purposes, including dividends and share repurchases. As of December 28, 2019 and September 28, 2019 , the Company had $ 5.0 billion and $ 6.0 billion of Commercial Paper outstanding, respectively, with maturities generally less than nine months . The weighted-average interest rate of the Company’s Commercial Paper was 1.88 % and 2.24 % as of December 28, 2019 and September 28, 2019 , respectively. The following table provides a summary of cash flows associated with the issuance and maturities of Commercial Paper for the three months ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018 (in millions): Three Months Ended December 28, 2019 December 29, 2018 Maturities 90 days or less: Proceeds from/(Repayments of) commercial paper, net $ ( 175 ) $ 2,011 Maturities greater than 90 days: Proceeds from commercial paper 1,317 2,166 Repayments of commercial paper ( 2,121 ) ( 4,171 ) Repayments of commercial paper, net ( 804 ) ( 2,005 ) Total proceeds from/(repayments of) commercial paper, net $ ( 979 ) $ 6 Apple Inc. | Q1 2020 Form 10-Q | 16 Term Debt As of December 28, 2019 , the Company had outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $ 103.1 billion (collectively the “Notes”). The Notes are senior unsecured obligations and interest is payable in arrears. The following table provides a summary of the Company’s term debt as of December 28, 2019 and September 28, 2019 : Maturities (calendar year) December 28, 2019 September 28, 2019 Amount (in millions) Effective Interest Rate Amount (in millions) Effective Interest Rate 2013 – 2019 debt issuances: Floating-rate notes 2020 – 2022 $ 4,250 1.97 % – 3.04 % $ 4,250 2.25 % – 3.28 % Fixed-rate 0.350% – 4.650% notes 2020 – 2049 96,610 0.28 % – 4.78 % 97,429 0.28 % – 4.78 % First quarter 2020 debt issuance of €2.0 billion: Fixed-rate 0.000% – 0.500% notes 2025 – 2031 2,226 0.03 % – 0.56 % — — % Total term debt 103,086 101,679 Unamortized premium/(discount) and issuance costs, net ( 229 ) ( 224 ) Hedge accounting fair value adjustments 445 612 Less: Current portion of term debt ( 10,224 ) ( 10,260 ) Total non-current portion of term debt $ 93,078 $ 91,807 To manage interest rate risk on certain of its U.S. dollar–denominated fixed- or floating-rate notes, the Company has entered into interest rate swaps to effectively convert the fixed interest rates to floating interest rates or the floating interest rates to fixed interest rates on a portion of these notes. Additionally, to manage foreign currency risk on certain of its foreign currency–denominated notes, the Company has entered into foreign currency swaps to effectively convert these notes to U.S. dollar–denominated notes. A portion of the Company’s Japanese yen–denominated notes is designated as a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of the Company’s net investment in a foreign operation. As of December 28, 2019 and September 28, 2019 , the carrying value of the debt designated as a net investment hedge was $ 1.2 billion and $ 1.0 billion , respectively. For further discussion regarding the Company’s use of derivative instruments, refer to the Derivative Financial Instruments section of Note 3, “Financial Instruments.” The effective interest rates for the Notes include the interest on the Notes, amortization of the discount or premium and, if applicable, adjustments related to hedging. The Company recognized $ 757 million and $ 809 million of interest cost on its term debt for the three months ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018 , respectively. As of December 28, 2019 and September 28, 2019 , the fair value of the Company’s Notes, based on Level 2 inputs, was $ 109.1 billion and $ 107.5 billion , respectively. Note 7 – Shareholders’ Equity On April 30, 2019, the Company announced the Board of Directors increased the current share repurchase program authorization from $ 100 billion to $ 175 billion of the Company’s common stock, of which $ 116.1 billion had been utilized as of December 28, 2019 . During the three months ended December 28, 2019 , the Company repurchased 70.4 million shares of its common stock for $ 20.0 billion , including 30.4 million shares initially delivered under a $ 10.0 billion accelerated share repurchase arrangement (“ASR”) dated November 2019. The Company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. Under this program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Under the Company’s ASR, financial institutions deliver shares of the Company’s common stock during the purchase period in exchange for an up-front payment. The total number of shares ultimately delivered under the ASR, and therefore the average repurchase price paid per share, is determined based on the volume-weighted average price of the Company’s common stock during the purchase period, which will end in or before May 2020. The shares received are retired in the periods they are delivered, and the up-front payment is accounted for as a reduction to retained earnings in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Statement of Shareholders’ Equity in the period the payment is made. Apple Inc. | Q1 2020 Form 10-Q | 17 Note 8 – Comprehensive Income The Company’s OCI consists of foreign currency translation adjustments from those subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, net deferred gains and losses on certain derivative instruments accounted for as hedges and unrealized gains and losses on marketable debt securities classified as available-for-sale. The following table shows the pre-tax amounts reclassified from AOCI into the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, and the associated financial statement line items, for the three months ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018 (in millions): Three Months Ended Comprehensive Income Components Financial Statement Line Items December 28, 2019 December 29, 2018 Unrealized (gains)/losses on derivative instruments: Foreign exchange contracts Total net sales $ ( 97 ) $ 63 Total cost of sales ( 171 ) ( 375 ) Other income/(expense), net ( 223 ) 396 Interest rate contracts Other income/(expense), net 2 1 ( 489 ) 85 Unrealized (gains)/losses on marketable securities Other income/(expense), net ( 13 ) 47 Total amounts reclassified from AOCI $ ( 502 ) $ 132 The following table shows the changes in AOCI by component for the three months ended December 28, 2019 (in millions): Cumulative Foreign Currency Translation Unrealized Gains/Losses on Derivative Instruments Unrealized Gains/Losses on Marketable Securities Total Balances as of September 28, 2019 $ ( 1,463 ) $ 172 $ 707 $ ( 584 ) Other comprehensive income/(loss) before reclassifications 207 182 163 552 Amounts reclassified from AOCI — ( 489 ) ( 13 ) ( 502 ) Tax effect ( 5 ) 20 ( 35 ) ( 20 ) Other comprehensive income/(loss) 202 ( 287 ) 115 30 Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle (1) — 136 — 136 Balances as of December 28, 2019 $ ( 1,261 ) $ 21 $ 822 $ ( 418 ) (1) Refer to Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” for more information on the Company’s adoption of ASU 2017-12 at the beginning of the first quarter of 2020. Note 9 – Benefit Plans Stock Plans The Company had 194.4 million shares reserved for future issuance under its stock plans as of December 28, 2019 . Restricted stock units (“RSUs”) granted under the Company’s stock plans generally vest over four years , based on continued employment, and are settled upon vesting in shares of the Company’s common stock on a one -for-one basis. RSUs granted under the Company’s stock plans reduce the number of shares available for grant under the plans by a factor of two times the number of RSUs granted. RSUs canceled and shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations increase the number of shares available for grant under the plans utilizing a factor of two times the number of RSUs canceled or shares withheld. Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans During the three months ended December 28, 2019 , Section 16 officers Timothy D. Cook, Chris Kondo, Luca Maestri, Deirdre O’Brien and Jeffrey Williams had equity trading plans in place in accordance with Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) under the Exchange Act. An equity trading plan is a written document that pre-establishes the amounts, prices and dates (or formula for determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of the Company’s stock, including shares acquired under the Company’s employee and director equity plans. Apple Inc. | Q1 2020 Form 10-Q | 18 Restricted Stock Units A summary of the Company’s RSU activity and related information for the three months ended December 28, 2019 is as follows: Number of RSUs (in thousands) Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value Per RSU Aggregate Fair Value (in millions) Balance as of September 28, 2019 81,517 $ 169.18 RSUs granted 33,775 $ 220.78 RSUs vested ( 17,837 ) $ 150.42 RSUs canceled ( 1,435 ) $ 184.51 Balance as of December 28, 2019 $ 96,020 $ 190.59 $ 27,827 The fair value as of the respective vesting dates of RSUs was $ 4.2 billion and $ 4.1 billion for the three months ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018 , respectively. Share-Based Compensation The following table shows share-based compensation expense and the related income tax benefit included in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three months ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018 (in millions): Three Months Ended December 28, 2019 December 29, 2018 Share-based compensation expense $ 1,710 $ 1,559 Income tax benefit related to share-based compensation expense $ ( 758 ) $ ( 750 ) As of December 28, 2019 , the total unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding RSUs and stock options was $ 15.7 billion , which the Company expects to recognize over a weighted-average period of 2.9 years . Note 10 – Commitments and Contingencies Accrued Warranty and Guarantees The following table shows changes in the Company’s accrued warranties and related costs for the three months ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018 (in millions): Three Months Ended December 28, 2019 December 29, 2018 Beginning accrued warranty and related costs $ 3,570 $ 3,692 Cost of warranty claims ( 915 ) ( 996 ) Accruals for product warranty 1,218 1,123 Ending accrued warranty and related costs $ 3,873 $ 3,819 The Company offers an iPhone Upgrade Program, which is available to customers who purchase a qualifying iPhone in the U.S., the U.K. and mainland China. The iPhone Upgrade Program provides customers the right to trade in that iPhone for a specified amount when purchasing a new iPhone, provided certain conditions are met. The Company accounts for the trade-in right as a guarantee liability and recognizes arrangement revenue net of the fair value of such right, with subsequent changes to the guarantee liability recognized within net sales. Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product Although most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets and other electronic devices. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. Apple Inc. | Q1 2020 Form 10-Q | 19 The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements. The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Substantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia, with some Mac computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland. Unconditional Purchase Obligations The Company has entered into certain off–balance sheet commitments that require the future purchase of goods or services (“unconditional purchase obligations”). The Company’s unconditional purchase obligations primarily consist of payments for supplier arrangements, Internet and telecommunication services, intellectual property licenses and content creation. As of December 28, 2019 , the Company’s total future payments under noncancelable unconditional purchase obligations having a remaining term in excess of one year were $ 10.5 billion . Contingencies The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully resolved. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims, except for the following matters: VirnetX VirnetX, Inc. (“VirnetX”) filed two lawsuits in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas (the “Eastern Texas District Court”) against the Company alleging that certain Company products infringe four patents (the “VirnetX Patents”) relating to network communications technology (“VirnetX I” and “VirnetX II”). On September 30, 2016, a jury returned a verdict in VirnetX I against the Company and awarded damages of $ 302 million , which later increased to $ 440 million in post-trial proceedings. The Company appealed the VirnetX I verdict to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (the “Federal Circuit”). On April 11, 2018, a jury returned a verdict in VirnetX II against the Company and awarded damages of $ 503 million . The Company appealed the VirnetX II verdict to the Federal Circuit, and on November 22, 2019, the Federal Circuit affirmed-in-part, reversed-in-part, and remanded VirnetX II back to the Eastern Texas District Court. The Company has challenged the validity of the VirnetX Patents at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the “PTO”). In response, the PTO has declared the VirnetX Patents invalid. VirnetX appealed the invalidity decision of the PTO to the Federal Circuit. The Federal Circuit consolidated the Company’s appeal of the Eastern Texas District Court VirnetX I verdict and VirnetX’s appeals from the PTO invalidity proceedings. On January 15, 2019, the Federal Circuit affirmed the VirnetX I verdict, which the Company has further appealed. On July 8, 2019, the Federal Circuit remanded one of VirnetX’s two appeals of the PTO’s invalidity decisions back to the PTO for further proceedings. On August 1, 2019, the Federal Circuit affirmed-in-part, vacated-in-part, and remanded back to the PTO portions of VirnetX’s second appeal. The Company has accrued its best estimate for the ultimate resolution of these matters. iOS Performance Management Cases Various civil litigation matters have been filed in state and federal courts in the U.S. and in various international jurisdictions alleging violation of consumer protection laws, fraud, computer intrusion and other causes of action related to the Company’s performance management feature used in its iPhone operating systems, introduced to certain iPhones in iOS updates 10.2.1 and 11.2. The claims seek monetary damages and other non-monetary relief. On April 5, 2018, several U.S. federal actions were consolidated through a Multidistrict Litigation process into a single action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. In addition to civil litigation, the Company is also responding to governmental investigations and requests for information relating to the performance management feature. The Company believes that its iPhones were not defective, that the performance management feature introduced with iOS updates 10.2.1 and 11.2 was intended to, and did, improve customers’ user experience, and that the Company did not make any misleading statements or fail to disclose any material information. The Company has accrued its best estimate for the ultimate resolution of these matters. Apple Inc. | Q1 2020 Form 10-Q | 20 French Competition Authority In June 2019, the French Competition Authority (“FCA”) issued a report alleging that aspects of the Company’s sales and distribution practices in France violate French competition law. The Company vigorously disagrees with the allegations, and a hearing of arguments was held before the FCA on October 15, 2019. The Company is awaiting the decision of the FCA, which may include a fine. Note 11 – Segment Information and Geographic Data The Company reports segment information based on the “management” approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company’s reportable segments. The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described in Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of the 2019 Form 10-K. The Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company’s retail stores located in those geographic locations. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the reportable segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as research and development, corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges and other separately managed general and administrative costs. The Company does not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes. The following table shows information by reportable segment for the three months ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018 (in millions): Three Months Ended December 28, 2019 December 29, 2018 Americas: Net sales $ 41,367 $ 36,940 Operating income $ 13,092 $ 11,200 Europe: Net sales $ 23,273 $ 20,363 Operating income $ 7,719 $ 6,658 Greater China: Net sales $ 13,578 $ 13,169 Operating income $ 5,363 $ 5,314 Japan: Net sales $ 6,223 $ 6,910 Operating income $ 2,778 $ 3,014 Rest of Asia Pacific: Net sales $ 7,378 $ 6,928 Operating income $ 2,731 $ 2,560 Apple Inc. | Q1 2020 Form 10-Q | 21 A reconciliation of the Company’s segment operating income to the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three months ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018 is as follows (in millions): Three Months Ended December 28, 2019 December 29, 2018 Segment operating income $ 31,683 $ 28,746 Research and development expense ( 4,451 ) ( 3,902 ) Other corporate expenses, net ( 1,663 ) ( 1,498 ) Total operating income $ 25,569 $ 23,346 Note 12 – Leases The Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including retail, corporate, manufacturing and data center space. These leases typically have original terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multi-year renewal options, some of which are reasonably certain of exercise. The Company’s lease arrangements may contain both lease and non-lease components. The Company has elected to combine and account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for leases of retail, corporate, and data center facilities. Payments under the Company’s lease arrangements may be fixed or variable, and variable lease payments are primarily based on purchases of output of the underlying leased assets. Lease costs associated with fixed payments on the Company’s operating leases were $ 369 million for the three months ended December 28, 2019 . Lease costs associated with variable payments on the Company’s leases were $ 3.0 billion for the three months ended December 28, 2019 . For the three months ended December 28, 2019 , the Company made $ 349 million of fixed cash payments related to operating leases. Non-cash activities involving ROU assets obtained in exchange for lease liabilities were $ 8.2 billion for the three months ended December 28, 2019 , including the impact of adopting the new leases standard. The following table shows ROU assets and lease liabilities, and the associated financial statement line items, as of December 28, 2019 (in millions): Lease-Related Assets and Liabilities Financial Statement Line Items December 28, 2019 Right-of-use assets: Operating leases Other non-current assets $ 7,262 Finance leases Property, plant and equipment, net 629 Total right-of-use assets $ 7,891 Lease liabilities: Operating leases Other current liabilities $ 1,245 Other non-current liabilities 6,573 Finance leases Other current liabilities 14 Other non-current liabilities 627 Total lease liabilities $ 8,459 Apple Inc. | Q1 2020 Form 10-Q | 22 Lease liability maturities as of December 28, 2019 , are as follows (in millions): Operating Leases Finance Leases Total 2020 (remaining nine months) $ 1,051 $ 23 $ 1,074 2021 1,398 34 1,432 2022 1,218 35 1,253 2023 966 46 1,012 2024 845 25 870 Thereafter 3,579 921 4,500 Total undiscounted liabilities 9,057 1,084 10,141 Less: Imputed interest ( 1,239 ) ( 443 ) ( 1,682 ) Total lease liabilities $ 7,818 $ 641 $ 8,459 The weighted-average remaining lease term and discount rate related to the Company’s lease liabilities as of December 28, 2019 were 10.2 years and 2.1 % , respectively. The Company’s lease discount rates are generally based on estimates of its incremental borrowing rate, as the discount rates implicit in the Company’s leases cannot be readily determined. As of December 28, 2019 , the Company had $ 2.1 billion of future payments under additional leases, primarily for corporate facilities and retail space, that had not yet commenced. These leases will commence between 2020 and 2022, with lease terms ranging from less than 1 year to 16 years . Apple Inc. | Q1 2020 Form 10-Q | 23 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This section and other parts of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“Form 10-Q”) contain forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. Forward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as “future,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “predicts,” “will,” “would,” “could,” “can,” “may,” and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company’s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 28, 2019 (the “ 2019 Form 10-K”) under the heading “Risk Factors.” The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the 2019 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.

Quarterly Highlights Business Seasonality and Product Introductions The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction. First Quarter Fiscal 2020 Highlights Total net sales increased 9% or $7.5 billion during the first quarter of 2020 compared to the same quarter in 2019 , primarily driven by higher iPhone and Wearables, Home and Accessories net sales. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable impact on net sales during the first quarter of 2020 . During the first quarter of 2020 , the Company began shipping AirPods Pro™, the new 16-inch MacBook Pro ® and the updated Mac Pro ® . Additionally, the Company released Apple TV+ as a new service. The Company repurchased $20.0 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $3.5 billion during the first quarter of 2020 .

Products gross margin percentage during the first quarter of 2020 was relatively flat compared to the same quarter in 2019 . Services Gross Margin Services gross margin and Services gross margin percentage increased during the first quarter of 2020 compared to the same quarter in 2019 due primarily to a favorable Services mix and higher leverage, partially offset by higher Services costs. The Company’s future gross margins can be impacted by a variety of factors, as discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the 2019 Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors”. As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and remain under downward pressure. Operating Expenses Operating expenses for the three months ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018 were as follows (dollars in millions): Three Months Ended December 28, 2019 December 29, 2018 Research and development $ 4,451 $ 3,902 Percentage of total net sales 5 % 5 % Selling, general and administrative $ 5,197 $ 4,783 Percentage of total net sales 6 % 6 % Total operating expenses $ 9,648 $ 8,685 Percentage of total net sales 11 % 10 % Research and Development The growth in research and development (“R&D”) expense during the first quarter of 2020 compared to the same quarter in 2019 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses. The Company continues to believe that focused investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace, and to the development of new and updated products and services that are central to the Company’s core business strategy. Selling, General and Administrative The growth in selling, general and administrative expense during the first quarter of 2020 compared to the same quarter in 2019 was driven primarily by higher spending on marketing and advertising and increases in headcount-related expenses.

The weighted-average interest rate earned by the Company on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was 2.08% and 2.19% in the first quarter of 2020 and 2019 , respectively. Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for the three months ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018 were as follows (dollars in millions): Three Months Ended December 28, 2019 December 29, 2018 Provision for income taxes $ 3,682 $ 3,941 Effective tax rate 14.2 % 16.5 % Statutory federal income tax rate 21 % 21 % The Company’s effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2020 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to lower tax rates on foreign earnings, tax benefits from share-based compensation and a one-time adjustment of U.S. foreign tax credits in response to regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in December 2019. The Company’s effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2020 was lower compared to the same quarter in 2019 due to a one-time adjustment of U.S. foreign tax credits. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Financial Instruments In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“ASU 2016-13”), which modifies the measurement of expected credit losses on certain financial instruments. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-13 in its first quarter of 2021 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. Based on the composition of the Company’s investment portfolio, current market conditions, and historical credit loss activity, the adoption of ASU 2016-13 is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. Apple Inc. | Q1 2020 Form 10-Q | 28 Liquidity and Capital Resources The following tables present selected financial information and statistics as of December 28, 2019 and September 28, 2019 and for the first three months of 2020 and 2019 (in millions): December 28, 2019 September 28, 2019 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities (1) $ 207,061 $ 205,898 Property, plant and equipment, net $ 37,031 $ 37,378 Commercial paper $ 4,990 $ 5,980 Total term debt $ 103,302 $ 102,067 Working capital $ 61,070 $ 57,101 Three Months Ended December 28, 2019 December 29, 2018 Cash generated by operating activities $ 30,516 $ 26,690 Cash generated by/(used in) investing activities $ (13,668 ) $ 5,844 Cash used in financing activities $ (25,407 ) $ (13,676 ) (1) As of December 28, 2019 and September 28, 2019 , total marketable securities included $19.1 billion and $18.9 billion , respectively, that was restricted from general use, related to the State Aid Decision (refer to Note 5, “Income Taxes” in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q) and other agreements.

Apple Inc. | Q1 2020 Form 10-Q | 30 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates, and such differences may be material. Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of the 2019 Form 10-K, and “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in Part II, Item 7 of the 2019 Form 10-K describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements. There have been no material changes to the Company’s critical accounting policies and estimates since the 2019 Form 10-K. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk There have been no material changes to the Company’s market risk during the first three months of 2020 .

Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act were effective as of December 28, 2019 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Apple Inc. | Q1 2020 Form 10-Q | 31 PART II — OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings The Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. Except as described in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, “Commitments and Contingencies” under the heading “Contingencies,” in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. The Company settled certain matters during the first quarter of 2020 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating results. Item 1A. Risk Factors The business, financial condition and operating results of the Company can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described in Part I, Item 1A of the 2019 Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors,” any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly, cause the Company’s actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from past, or from anticipated future, financial condition and operating results. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, operating results and stock price. There have been no material changes to the Company’s risk factors since the 2019 Form 10-K. Apple Inc. | Q1 2020 Form 10-Q | 32 Item 2.

Apple Inc. | Q3 2019 Form 10-Q | 5 Apple Inc. Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation and Preparation The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively “Apple” or the “Company”). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. In the opinion of the Company’s management, the condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation. These condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the Company’s annual consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2018 (the “ 2018 Form 10-K”). The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. A 14th week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. The Company’s fiscal years 2019 and 2018 span 52 weeks each. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Revenue Recognition In the first quarter of 2019, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (the “FASB”) Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (“ASU 2014-09”), and additional ASUs issued to clarify the guidance in ASU 2014-09 (collectively the “new revenue standard”), which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. The Company adopted the new revenue standard utilizing the full retrospective transition method. The Company did not restate total net sales in the prior periods presented, as adoption of the new revenue standard did not have a material impact on previously reported amounts. Additionally, beginning in the first quarter of 2019, the Company classified the amortization of the deferred value of Maps, Siri ® and free iCloud ® services, which are bundled in the sales price of iPhone ® , Mac ® , iPad ® and certain other products, in services net sales. Historically, the Company classified the amortization of these amounts in products net sales consistent with its management reporting framework. As a result, products and services net sales information for the third quarter and first nine months of 2018 was reclassified to conform to the 2019 presentation. Financial Instruments In the first quarter of 2019, the Company adopted FASB ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments – Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (“ASU 2016-01”), which updates certain aspects of the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. The adoption of ASU 2016-01 did not have a material impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements. Income Taxes In the first quarter of 2019, the Company adopted FASB ASU No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory (“ASU 2016-16”), which requires the recognition of the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs. The Company adopted ASU 2016-16 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. Upon adoption, the Company recorded $ 2.7 billion of net deferred tax assets, reduced other non-current assets by $ 128 million , and increased retained earnings by $ 2.6 billion on its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company will recognize incremental deferred income tax expense as these net deferred tax assets are utilized. Restricted Cash In the first quarter of 2019, the Company adopted FASB ASU No. 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash (“ASU 2016-18”), which enhances and clarifies the guidance on the classification and presentation of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows and requires additional disclosures about restricted cash balances. Apple Inc. | Q3 2019 Form 10-Q | 6 Earnings Per Share The following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 29, 2019 and June 30, 2018 (net income in millions and shares in thousands): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended June 29, 2019 June 30, 2018 June 29, 2019 June 30, 2018 Numerator: Net income $ 10,044 $ 11,519 $ 41,570 $ 45,406 Denominator: Weighted-average basic shares outstanding 4,570,633 4,882,167 4,660,175 5,006,640 Effect of dilutive securities 30,747 44,442 31,584 44,323 Weighted-average diluted shares 4,601,380 4,926,609 4,691,759 5,050,963 Basic earnings per share $ 2.20 $ 2.36 $ 8.92 $ 9.07 Diluted earnings per share $ 2.18 $ 2.34 $ 8.86 $ 8.99 Potentially dilutive securities representing 1.5 million and 20.5 million shares of common stock were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 29, 2019 , respectively, because their effect would have been antidilutive. Restricted Cash and Restricted Marketable Securities The Company considers cash and marketable securities to be restricted when withdrawal or general use is legally restricted. The Company records restricted cash as other assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, and determines current or non-current classification based on the expected duration of the restriction. The Company records restricted marketable securities as current or non-current marketable securities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets based on the classification of the underlying securities. Note 2 – Revenue Recognition Net sales consist of revenue from the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad, services and other products. The Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is transferred to its customers. Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company’s products net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company’s services net sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered. Payment for products and services net sales is collected within a short period of time following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable. The Company records reductions to products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer incentive programs based on the Company’s expectations and historical experience. For arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are capable of being distinct, the Company allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (“SSP”). When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine the SSP. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are established that reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company’s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation. Apple Inc. | Q3 2019 Form 10-Q | 7 The Company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud, Siri and Maps. The third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company’s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided. Cost of sales related to delivered hardware and bundled software, including estimated warranty costs, are recognized at the time of sale. Costs incurred to provide product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights are recognized as cost of sales as incurred. For certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For these arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized revenue, and has elected not to disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services. For the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products including, but not limited to, evaluating if it has the ability to establish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party applications sold through the App Store ® , Mac App Store and TV App Store and certain digital content sold through the iTunes Store ® , the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for such sales on a net basis by recognizing in services net sales only the commission it retains. The Company has elected to record revenue net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities, with the collected taxes recorded within other current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority. Deferred Revenue As of June 29, 2019 and September 29, 2018 , the Company had total deferred revenue of $ 8.0 billion and $ 8.8 billion , respectively. As of June 29, 2019 , the Company expects 68 % of total deferred revenue to be realized in less than a year, 25 % within one-to-two years, 6 % within two-to-three years and 1 % in greater than three years. Apple Inc. | Q3 2019 Form 10-Q | 8 Disaggregated Revenue Net sales disaggregated by significant products and services for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 29, 2019 and June 30, 2018 were as follows (in millions): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended June 29, 2019 June 30, 2018 June 29, 2019 June 30, 2018 iPhone (1) $ 25,986 $ 29,470 $ 109,019 $ 128,133 Mac (1) 5,820 5,258 18,749 17,858 iPad (1) 5,023 4,634 16,624 14,397 Wearables, Home and Accessories (1)(2) 5,525 3,733 17,962 13,158 Services (3) 11,455 10,170 33,780 29,149 Total net sales (4) $ 53,809 $ 53,265 $ 196,134 $ 202,695 (1) Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are bundled in the sales price of the respective product.

The Company’s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable segment in Note 11, “Segment Information and Geographic Data” for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 29, 2019 and June 30, 2018 . Note 3 – Financial Instruments Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities The Company’s investments in marketable debt securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. The Company classifies its marketable debt securities as either short-term or long-term based on each instrument’s underlying contractual maturity date. Unrealized gains and losses on marketable debt securities classified as available-for-sale are recognized in other comprehensive income/(loss) (“OCI”). The Company’s investments in marketable equity securities are classified based on the nature of the securities and their availability for use in current operations. The Company’s marketable equity securities are measured at fair value with gains and losses recognized in other income/(expense), net. Apple Inc. | Q3 2019 Form 10-Q | 9 The following tables show the Company’s cash and marketable securities by significant investment category as of June 29, 2019 and September 29, 2018 (in millions): June 29, 2019 Adjusted Cost Unrealized Gains Unrealized Losses Fair Value Cash and Cash Equivalents Short-Term Marketable Securities Long-Term Marketable Securities Cash $ 12,075 $ — $ — $ 12,075 $ 12,075 $ — $ — Level 1 (1) : Money market funds 10,558 — — 10,558 10,558 — — Subtotal 10,558 — — 10,558 10,558 — — Level 2 (2) : U.S. Treasury securities 37,307 22 ( 102 ) 37,227 11,116 8,436 17,675 U.S. agency securities 9,552 1 ( 5 ) 9,548 7,711 450 1,387 Non-U.S. government securities 20,569 272 ( 63 ) 20,778 636 3,467 16,675 Certificates of deposit and time deposits 4,838 — — 4,838 3,495 1,273 70 Commercial paper 5,161 — — 5,161 4,930 231 — Corporate debt securities 93,896 550 ( 173 ) 94,273 9 29,027 65,237 Municipal securities 961 9 ( 1 ) 969 — 65 904 Mortgage- and asset-backed securities 15,262 38 ( 117 ) 15,183 — 1,135 14,048 Subtotal 187,546 892 ( 461 ) 187,977 27,897 44,084 115,996 Total (3) $ 210,179 $ 892 $ ( 461 ) $ 210,610 $ 50,530 $ 44,084 $ 115,996 September 29, 2018 Adjusted Cost Unrealized Gains Unrealized Losses Fair Value Cash and Cash Equivalents Short-Term Marketable Securities Long-Term Marketable Securities Cash $ 11,575 $ — $ — $ 11,575 $ 11,575 $ — $ — Level 1 (1) : Money market funds 8,083 — — 8,083 8,083 — — Mutual funds 799 — ( 116 ) 683 — 683 — Subtotal 8,882 — ( 116 ) 8,766 8,083 683 — Level 2 (2) : U.S. Treasury securities 47,296 — ( 1,202 ) 46,094 1,613 7,606 36,875 U.S. agency securities 4,127 — ( 48 ) 4,079 1,732 360 1,987 Non-U.S. government securities 21,601 49 ( 250 ) 21,400 — 3,355 18,045 Certificates of deposit and time deposits 3,074 — — 3,074 1,247 1,330 497 Commercial paper 2,573 — — 2,573 1,663 910 — Corporate debt securities 123,001 152 ( 2,038 ) 121,115 — 25,162 95,953 Municipal securities 946 — ( 12 ) 934 — 178 756 Mortgage- and asset-backed securities 18,105 8 ( 623 ) 17,490 — 804 16,686 Subtotal 220,723 209 ( 4,173 ) 216,759 6,255 39,705 170,799 Total (3) $ 241,180 $ 209 $ ( 4,289 ) $ 237,100 $ 25,913 $ 40,388 $ 170,799 (1) Level 1 fair value estimates are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

(3) As of June 29, 2019 and September 29, 2018 , total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities included $ 19.5 billion and $ 20.3 billion , respectively, that was restricted from general use, related to the State Aid Decision (refer to Note 5, “Income Taxes”) and other agreements. Apple Inc. | Q3 2019 Form 10-Q | 10 The Company may sell certain of its marketable debt securities prior to their stated maturities for reasons including, but not limited to, managing liquidity, credit risk, duration and asset allocation. The maturities of the Company’s long-term marketable debt securities generally range from one to five years . The following tables show information about the Company’s marketable securities that had been in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than 12 months and for 12 months or greater as of June 29, 2019 and September 29, 2018 (in millions): June 29, 2019 Continuous Unrealized Losses Less than 12 Months 12 Months or Greater Total Fair value of marketable debt securities $ 11,853 $ 71,984 $ 83,837 Unrealized losses $ ( 44 ) $ ( 417 ) $ ( 461 ) September 29, 2018 Continuous Unrealized Losses Less than 12 Months 12 Months or Greater Total Fair value of marketable securities $ 126,238 $ 60,599 $ 186,837 Unrealized losses $ ( 2,400 ) $ ( 1,889 ) $ ( 4,289 ) The Company typically invests in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company’s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. Fair values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. When evaluating a marketable debt security for other-than-temporary impairment, the Company reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below its cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto, changes in market interest rates and the Company’s intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the security before recovery of the security’s cost basis. As of June 29, 2019 , the Company does not consider any of its marketable debt securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired. Non-Marketable Securities The Company holds non-marketable equity securities of certain privately held companies without readily determinable fair values, and has elected to apply the measurement alternative. As such, the Company’s non-marketable equity securities are measured at cost, less any impairment, and are adjusted for changes in fair value resulting from observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. Gains and losses on non-marketable equity securities are recognized in other income/(expense), net. As of June 29, 2019 , the Company’s non-marketable equity securities had a carrying value of $ 2.4 billion . Restricted Cash A reconciliation of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet to cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows as of June 29, 2019 is as follows (in millions): June 29, 2019 Cash and cash equivalents $ 50,530 Restricted cash included in other current assets 266 Restricted cash included in other non-current assets 1,355 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 52,151 The Company’s restricted cash primarily consisted of cash required to be on deposit under a contractual agreement with a bank to support the Company’s iPhone Upgrade Program. Derivative Financial Instruments The Company may use derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risk on expected future cash flows, net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries, and certain existing assets and liabilities. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign currency exchange or interest rates. Apple Inc. | Q3 2019 Form 10-Q | 11 To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar may hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue, and subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar may hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries’ functional currencies. The Company may enter into forward contracts, option contracts or other instruments to manage this risk and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months . To protect the net investment in a foreign operation from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset a portion of the changes in the carrying amounts of these investments due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, the Company may use non-derivative financial instruments, such as its foreign currency–denominated debt, as hedges of its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries. In both of these cases, the Company designates these instruments as net investment hedges. To protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. These instruments may offset a portion of the foreign currency remeasurement gains or losses, or changes in fair value. The Company may designate these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of June 29, 2019 , the Company’s hedged term debt– and marketable securities–related foreign currency transactions are expected to be recognized within 23 years . The Company may also enter into non-designated foreign currency contracts to offset a portion of the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. To protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. These instruments may offset a portion of the changes in interest income or expense, or changes in fair value. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of June 29, 2019 , the Company’s hedged interest rate transactions are expected to be recognized within 8 years . Cash Flow Hedges The effective portions of cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (“AOCI”) until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of foreign currency revenue are recognized as a component of net sales in the same period as the related revenue is recognized, and deferred gains and losses related to cash flow hedges of inventory purchases are recognized as a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related costs are recognized. Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of interest income or expense are recognized in other income/(expense), net in the same period as the related income or expense is recognized. For options designated as cash flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. The ineffective portions and amounts excluded from the effectiveness testing of cash flow hedges are recognized in other income/(expense), net. Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially identified time period or within a subsequent two-month time period. Deferred gains and losses in AOCI associated with such derivative instruments are reclassified into other income/(expense), net in the period of de-designation. Any subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are reflected in other income/(expense), net unless they are re-designated as hedges of other transactions. Net Investment Hedges The effective portions of net investment hedges are recorded in OCI as a part of the cumulative translation adjustment. The ineffective portions and amounts excluded from the effectiveness testing of net investment hedges are recognized in other income/(expense), net. For foreign exchange forward contracts designated as net investment hedges, the Company excludes changes in fair value relating to changes in the forward carry component from its assessment of hedge effectiveness. Accordingly, any gains or losses related to this forward carry component are recognized in earnings in the current period. Fair Value Hedges Gains and losses related to changes in fair value hedges are recognized in earnings along with a corresponding loss or gain related to the change in value of the underlying hedged item in the same line in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. For foreign exchange forward contracts designated as fair value hedges, the Company excludes changes in fair value relating to changes in the forward carry component from its assessment of hedge effectiveness. Amounts excluded from the effectiveness testing of fair value hedges were gains of $ 171 million and $ 645 million for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 29, 2019 , respectively, and were recognized in other income/(expense), net. Apple Inc. | Q3 2019 Form 10-Q | 12 Non-Designated Derivatives Derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are adjusted to fair value through earnings in the financial statement line item to which the derivative relates. As a result, during the three- and nine-month periods ended June 29, 2019 , respectively, the Company recognized gains of $ 58 million and $ 283 million in net sales, gains of $ 40 million and $ 108 million in cost of sales and losses of $ 34 million and $ 58 million in other income/(expense), net. During the three- and nine-month periods ended June 30, 2018 , respectively, the Company recognized a gain of $ 135 million and a loss of $ 7 million in net sales, a gain of $ 151 million and a loss of $ 61 million in cost of sales and a gain of $ 132 million and a loss of $ 241 million in other income/(expense), net. The Company records all derivatives in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The Company’s accounting treatment for these derivative instruments is based on its hedge designation. The following tables show the Company’s derivative instruments at gross fair value as of June 29, 2019 and September 29, 2018 (in millions): June 29, 2019 Fair Value of Derivatives Designated as Hedge Instruments Fair Value of Derivatives Not Designated as Hedge Instruments Total Fair Value Derivative assets (1) : Foreign exchange contracts $ 1,179 $ 184 $ 1,363 Interest rate contracts $ 449 $ — $ 449 Derivative liabilities (2) : Foreign exchange contracts $ 860 $ 251 $ 1,111 Interest rate contracts $ 112 $ — $ 112 September 29, 2018 Fair Value of Derivatives Designated as Hedge Instruments Fair Value of Derivatives Not Designated as Hedge Instruments Total Fair Value Derivative assets (1) : Foreign exchange contracts $ 1,015 $ 259 $ 1,274 Derivative liabilities (2) : Foreign exchange contracts $ 543 $ 137 $ 680 Interest rate contracts $ 1,456 $ — $ 1,456 (1) The fair value of derivative assets is measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and is recorded as other current assets and other non-current assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. (2) The fair value of derivative liabilities is measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and is recorded as other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company classifies cash flows related to derivative financial instruments as operating activities in its Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Apple Inc. | Q3 2019 Form 10-Q | 13 The following table shows the pre-tax gains and losses of the Company’s derivative and non-derivative instruments designated as cash flow, net investment and fair value hedges in OCI and the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 29, 2019 and June 30, 2018 (in millions): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended June 29, 2019 June 30, 2018 June 29, 2019 June 30, 2018 Gains/(Losses) recognized in OCI – effective portion: Cash flow hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ ( 147 ) $ 40 $ ( 689 ) $ 230 Interest rate contracts — — — 1 Total $ ( 147 ) $ 40 $ ( 689 ) $ 231 Net investment hedges: Foreign currency debt $ ( 32 ) $ 13 $ ( 55 ) $ ( 18 ) Gains/(Losses) reclassified from AOCI into net income – effective portion: Cash flow hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ 53 $ ( 1,231 ) $ 69 $ ( 1,068 ) Interest rate contracts ( 2 ) — ( 5 ) 3 Total $ 51 $ ( 1,231 ) $ 64 $ ( 1,065 ) Gains/(Losses) on derivative instruments: Fair value hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ ( 136 ) $ 31 $ 509 $ 31 Interest rate contracts 671 ( 230 ) 1,793 ( 1,178 ) Total $ 535 $ ( 199 ) $ 2,302 $ ( 1,147 ) Gains/(Losses) related to hedged items: Fair value hedges: Marketable securities $ 136 $ ( 31 ) $ ( 508 ) $ ( 31 ) Fixed-rate debt ( 671 ) 230 ( 1,793 ) 1,178 Total $ ( 535 ) $ 199 $ ( 2,301 ) $ 1,147 The following table shows the notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments and credit risk amounts associated with outstanding or unsettled derivative instruments as of June 29, 2019 and September 29, 2018 (in millions): June 29, 2019 September 29, 2018 Notional Amount Credit Risk Amount Notional Amount Credit Risk Amount Instruments designated as accounting hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ 55,067 $ 1,179 $ 65,368 $ 1,015 Interest rate contracts $ 31,250 $ 449 $ 33,250 $ — Instruments not designated as accounting hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ 54,744 $ 184 $ 63,062 $ 259 Apple Inc. | Q3 2019 Form 10-Q | 14 The notional amounts for outstanding derivative instruments provide one measure of the transaction volume outstanding and do not represent the amount of the Company’s exposure to credit or market loss. The credit risk amounts represent the Company’s gross exposure to potential accounting loss on derivative instruments that are outstanding or unsettled if all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current currency or interest rates at each respective date. The Company’s exposure to credit loss and market risk will vary over time as currency and interest rates change. Although the table above reflects the notional and credit risk amounts of the Company’s derivative instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses associated with the exposures and transactions that the instruments are intended to hedge. The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments. The Company generally enters into master netting arrangements, which are designed to reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. The Company presents its derivative assets and derivative liabilities at their gross fair values in its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of June 29, 2019 , the net cash collateral received by the Company related to derivative instruments under its collateral security arrangements was $ 603 million , which was recorded as other current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of September 29, 2018 , the net cash collateral posted by the Company related to derivative instruments under its collateral security arrangements was $ 1.0 billion , which was recorded as other current assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. Under master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to the Company’s derivative contracts, the Company is allowed to net settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of June 29, 2019 and September 29, 2018 , the potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the Company’s derivative contracts, including the effects of collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $ 1.8 billion and $ 2.1 billion , respectively, resulting in a net derivative liability of $ 14 million and a net derivative asset of $ 138 million , respectively. Accounts Receivable Trade Receivables The Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, resellers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral or third-party credit support in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements. As of June 29, 2019 , the Company had one customer that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, which accounted for 11 % . As of September 29, 2018 , the Company had one customer that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, which accounted for 10 % . The Company’s cellular network carriers accounted for 42 % and 59 % of total trade receivables as of June 29, 2019 and September 29, 2018 , respectively. Vendor Non-Trade Receivables The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. As of June 29, 2019 , the Company had three vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 57 % , 12 % and 12 % . As of September 29, 2018 , the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 62 % and 12 % . Apple Inc. | Q3 2019 Form 10-Q | 15 Note 4 – Condensed Consolidated Financial Statement Details The following tables show the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statement details as of June 29, 2019 and September 29, 2018 (in millions): Property, Plant and Equipment, Net June 29, 2019 September 29, 2018 Land and buildings $ 16,560 $ 16,216 Machinery, equipment and internal-use software 68,529 65,982 Leasehold improvements 8,895 8,205 Gross property, plant and equipment 93,984 90,403 Accumulated depreciation and amortization ( 56,348 ) ( 49,099 ) Total property, plant and equipment, net $ 37,636 $ 41,304 Other Non-Current Liabilities June 29, 2019 September 29, 2018 Long-term taxes payable $ 30,521 $ 33,589 Other non-current liabilities 20,622 15,325 Total other non-current liabilities $ 51,143 $ 48,914 Other Income/(Expense), Net The following table shows the detail of other income/(expense), net for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 29, 2019 and June 30, 2018 (in millions): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended June 29, 2019 June 30, 2018 June 29, 2019 June 30, 2018 Interest and dividend income $ 1,190 $ 1,418 $ 3,855 $ 4,375 Interest expense ( 866 ) ( 846 ) ( 2,766 ) ( 2,372 ) Other income/(expense), net 43 100 216 ( 301 ) Total other income/(expense), net $ 367 $ 672 $ 1,305 $ 1,702 Note 5 – Income Taxes Uncertain Tax Positions As of June 29, 2019 , the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $ 14.8 billion , of which $ 8.1 billion , if recognized, would impact the Company’s effective tax rate. The Company had accrued $ 1.3 billion of gross interest and penalties as of June 29, 2019 . Both the unrecognized tax benefits and the associated interest and penalties that are not expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one year are classified as other non-current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service concluded its review of the years 2013 through 2015 in 2018, and all years prior to 2016 are closed. Tax years subsequent to 2006 in certain major U.S. states and subsequent to 2010 in certain major foreign jurisdictions remain open, and could be subject to examination by the taxing authorities. The Company believes that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Company’s tax audits are resolved in a manner inconsistent with its expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs. Although timing of resolution and/or closure of audits is not certain, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that its gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease (either by payment, release or a combination of both) in the next 12 months by as much as $ 400 million . Apple Inc. | Q3 2019 Form 10-Q | 16 European Commission State Aid Decision On August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company (the “State Aid Decision”). The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. The recovery amount was calculated to be € 13.1 billion , plus interest of € 1.2 billion . Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The Company believes the State Aid Decision to be without merit and appealed to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union. Ireland has also appealed the State Aid Decision. The Company believes that any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision would be creditable against U.S. taxes, subject to any foreign tax credit limitations in the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. As of June 29, 2019 , the entire recovery amount plus interest was funded into escrow, where it will remain restricted from general use pending conclusion of all appeals. Refer to Note 3, “Financial Instruments” for more information. Note 6 – Debt Commercial Paper The Company issues unsecured short-term promissory notes (“Commercial Paper”) pursuant to a commercial paper program. The Company uses net proceeds from the commercial paper program for general corporate purposes, including dividends and share repurchases. As of June 29, 2019 and September 29, 2018 , the Company had $ 10.0 billion and $ 12.0 billion of Commercial Paper outstanding, respectively, with maturities generally less than nine months . The weighted-average interest rate of the Company’s Commercial Paper was 2.49 % and 2.18 % as of June 29, 2019 and September 29, 2018 , respectively. The following table provides a summary of cash flows associated with the issuance and maturities of Commercial Paper for the nine months ended June 29, 2019 and June 30, 2018 (in millions): Nine Months Ended June 29, 2019 June 30, 2018 Maturities 90 days or less: Proceeds from/(Repayments of) commercial paper, net $ ( 3,720 ) $ 2,619 Maturities greater than 90 days: Proceeds from commercial paper 12,977 9,782 Repayments of commercial paper ( 11,283 ) ( 12,411 ) Proceeds from/(Repayments of) commercial paper, net 1,694 ( 2,629 ) Total repayments of commercial paper, net $ ( 2,026 ) $ ( 10 ) Term Debt As of June 29, 2019 , the Company had outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $ 98.3 billion (collectively the “Notes”). The Notes are senior unsecured obligations, and interest is payable in arrears, quarterly for the U.S. dollar–denominated and Australian dollar–denominated floating-rate notes, semi-annually for the U.S. dollar–denominated, Australian dollar–denominated, British pound–denominated, Japanese yen–denominated and Canadian dollar–denominated fixed-rate notes and annually for the euro-denominated and Swiss franc–denominated fixed-rate notes.

Additionally, to manage foreign currency risk on certain of its foreign currency–denominated notes, the Company has entered into foreign currency swaps to effectively convert these notes to U.S. dollar–denominated notes. A portion of the Company’s Japanese yen–denominated notes is designated as a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of the Company’s net investment in a foreign operation. As of June 29, 2019 and September 29, 2018 , the carrying value of the debt designated as a net investment hedge was $ 1.2 billion and $ 811 million , respectively. For further discussion regarding the Company’s use of derivative instruments, refer to the Derivative Financial Instruments section of Note 3, “Financial Instruments.” The effective interest rates for the Notes include the interest on the Notes, amortization of the discount or premium and, if applicable, adjustments related to hedging. The Company recognized $ 790 million and $ 2.4 billion of interest cost on its term debt for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 29, 2019 , respectively. The Company recognized $ 780 million and $ 2.2 billion of interest cost on its term debt for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 30, 2018 , respectively. As of June 29, 2019 and September 29, 2018 , the fair value of the Company’s Notes, based on Level 2 inputs, was $ 102.5 billion and $ 103.2 billion , respectively. Apple Inc. | Q3 2019 Form 10-Q | 18 Note 7 – Shareholders’ Equity On April 30, 2019, the Company announced the Board of Directors increased the current share repurchase program authorization from $ 100 billion to $ 175 billion of the Company’s common stock, of which $ 78.2 billion had been utilized as of June 29, 2019 . During the nine months ended June 29, 2019 , the Company repurchased 252.6 million shares of its common stock for $ 49.2 billion , including 55.1 million shares initially delivered under a $ 12.0 billion accelerated share repurchase arrangement dated February 2019. The Company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. Under this program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Note 8 – Comprehensive Income The Company’s OCI consists of foreign currency translation adjustments from those subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, net deferred gains and losses on certain derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges and unrealized gains and losses on marketable debt securities classified as available-for-sale. The following table shows the pre-tax amounts reclassified from AOCI into the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, and the associated financial statement line item, for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 29, 2019 and June 30, 2018 (in millions): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended Comprehensive Income Components Financial Statement Line Item June 29, 2019 June 30, 2018 June 29, 2019 June 30, 2018 Unrealized (gains)/losses on derivative instruments: Foreign exchange contracts Total net sales $ ( 68 ) $ 162 $ ( 102 ) $ 433 Total cost of sales 13 206 ( 438 ) 200 Other income/(expense), net 3 864 451 441 Interest rate contracts Other income/(expense), net 2 — 5 ( 3 ) ( 50 ) 1,232 ( 84 ) 1,071 Unrealized (gains)/losses on marketable securities Other income/(expense), net ( 28 ) 31 55 ( 49 ) Total amounts reclassified from AOCI $ ( 78 ) $ 1,263 $ ( 29 ) $ 1,022 The following table shows the changes in AOCI by component for the nine months ended June 29, 2019 (in millions): Cumulative Foreign Currency Translation Unrealized Gains/Losses on Derivative Instruments Unrealized Gains/Losses on Marketable Securities Total Balances as of September 29, 2018 $ ( 1,055 ) $ 810 $ ( 3,209 ) $ ( 3,454 ) Other comprehensive income/(loss) before reclassifications ( 136 ) ( 678 ) 4,340 3,526 Amounts reclassified from AOCI — ( 84 ) 55 ( 29 ) Tax effect 13 163 ( 947 ) ( 771 ) Other comprehensive income/(loss) ( 123 ) ( 599 ) 3,448 2,726 Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle (1) — — 89 89 Balances as of June 29, 2019 $ ( 1,178 ) $ 211 $ 328 $ ( 639 ) (1) Refer to Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” for more information on the Company’s adoption of ASU 2016-01 at the beginning of the first quarter of 2019. Apple Inc. | Q3 2019 Form 10-Q | 19 Note 9 – Benefit Plans Stock Plans The Company had 247.8 million shares reserved for future issuance under its stock plans as of June 29, 2019 . Restricted stock units (“RSUs”) granted under the Company’s stock plans generally vest over four years , based on continued employment, and are settled upon vesting in shares of the Company’s common stock on a one -for-one basis. Each share issued with respect to RSUs granted under the Company’s stock plans reduces the number of shares available for grant under the plans by two shares. RSUs canceled and shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations increase the number of shares available for grant under the plans utilizing a factor of two times the number of RSUs canceled or shares withheld. Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans During the three months ended June 29, 2019 , Section 16 officers Timothy D. Cook, Chris Kondo, Luca Maestri, Deirdre O’Brien and Jeffrey Williams had equity trading plans in place in accordance with Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) under the Exchange Act. An equity trading plan is a written document that pre-establishes the amounts, prices and dates (or formula for determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of the Company’s stock, including shares acquired pursuant to the Company’s employee and director equity plans. Restricted Stock Units A summary of the Company’s RSU activity and related information for the nine months ended June 29, 2019 is as follows: Number of RSUs (in thousands) Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value Per RSU Aggregate Fair Value (in millions) Balance as of September 29, 2018 92,155 $ 134.60 RSUs granted 34,805 $ 216.40 RSUs vested ( 39,440 ) $ 135.82 RSUs canceled ( 4,478 ) $ 161.14 Balance as of June 29, 2019 83,042 $ 166.87 $ 16,436 The fair value as of the respective vesting dates of RSUs was $ 3.7 billion and $ 8.1 billion for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 29, 2019 , respectively, and was $ 3.3 billion and $ 6.9 billion for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 30, 2018 , respectively. Share-Based Compensation The following table shows share-based compensation expense and the related income tax benefit included in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 29, 2019 and June 30, 2018 (in millions): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended June 29, 2019 June 30, 2018 June 29, 2019 June 30, 2018 Share-based compensation expense $ 1,496 $ 1,351 $ 4,569 $ 3,995 Income tax benefit related to share-based compensation expense $ ( 502 ) $ ( 528 ) $ ( 1,583 ) $ ( 1,506 ) As of June 29, 2019 , the total unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding RSUs and stock options was $ 11.6 billion , which the Company expects to recognize over a weighted-average period of 2.6 years . Apple Inc. | Q3 2019 Form 10-Q | 20 Note 10 – Commitments and Contingencies Accrued Warranty and Indemnification The following table shows changes in the Company’s accrued warranties and related costs for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 29, 2019 and June 30, 2018 (in millions): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended June 29, 2019 June 30, 2018 June 29, 2019 June 30, 2018 Beginning accrued warranty and related costs $ 3,487 $ 4,030 $ 3,692 $ 3,834 Cost of warranty claims ( 912 ) ( 1,044 ) ( 2,823 ) ( 2,959 ) Accruals for product warranty 548 567 2,254 2,678 Ending accrued warranty and related costs $ 3,123 $ 3,553 $ 3,123 $ 3,553 Agreements entered into by the Company may include indemnification provisions, which may subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to indemnification of third parties. The Company offers an iPhone Upgrade Program, which is available to customers who purchase a qualifying iPhone in the U.S., the U.K. and mainland China. The iPhone Upgrade Program provides customers the right to trade in that iPhone for a specified amount when purchasing a new iPhone, provided certain conditions are met. The Company accounts for the trade-in right as a guarantee liability and recognizes arrangement revenue net of the fair value of such right, with subsequent changes to the guarantee liability recognized within net sales. The Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers. Under these agreements, the Company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers of the Company, and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim. While the Company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise. Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product Although most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. In addition, the Company competes for various components with other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices and personal computers. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that could materially adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and operating results. The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. If the Company’s supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company’s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. The Company’s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements. The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results. Apple Inc. | Q3 2019 Form 10-Q | 21 Substantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia, with some Mac computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland. A significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Certain of these outsourcing partners are single-sourced suppliers of components and manufacturers for many of the Company’s products. Although the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the Company’s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production commitments. The Company’s manufacturing purchase obligations typically cover its requirements for periods up to 150 days . Other Off–Balance Sheet Commitments Operating Leases The Company leases various equipment and facilities, including retail space, under noncancelable operating lease arrangements. The Company does not currently utilize any other off–balance sheet financing arrangements. As of June 29, 2019 , the Company’s total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases were $ 11.1 billion . The Company’s retail store and other facility leases typically have original terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multi-year renewal options. Unconditional Purchase Obligations The Company has entered into certain off–balance sheet commitments that require the future purchase of goods or services (“unconditional purchase obligations”). The Company’s unconditional purchase obligations primarily consist of payments for supplier arrangements, internet and telecommunication services, intellectual property licenses and content creation. As of June 29, 2019 , the Company’s total future payments under noncancelable unconditional purchase obligations having a remaining term in excess of one year were $ 8.1 billion . Contingencies The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully adjudicated, as further discussed in Part II, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q under the heading “Legal Proceedings” and in Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q under the heading “Risk Factors.” The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims, except for the following matters: VirnetX VirnetX, Inc. (“VirnetX”) filed two lawsuits in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas (the “Eastern Texas District Court”) against the Company alleging that certain Company products infringe four patents (the “VirnetX Patents”) relating to network communications technology (“VirnetX I” and “VirnetX II”). On September 30, 2016, a jury returned a verdict in VirnetX I against the Company and awarded damages of $ 302 million , which later increased to $ 440 million in post-trial proceedings. The Company appealed the VirnetX I verdict to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (the “Federal Circuit”). On April 11, 2018, a jury returned a verdict in VirnetX II against the Company and awarded damages of $ 503 million . VirnetX II is currently on appeal. The Company has challenged the validity of the VirnetX Patents at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the “PTO”). In response, the PTO has declared the VirnetX Patents invalid. VirnetX appealed the invalidity decision of the PTO to the Federal Circuit. The Federal Circuit consolidated the Company’s appeal of the Eastern Texas District Court VirnetX I verdict and VirnetX’s appeals from the PTO invalidity proceedings. On January 15, 2019, the Federal Circuit affirmed the VirnetX I verdict, which the Company intends to further appeal. On July 8, 2019, the Federal Circuit remanded one of VirnetX’s appeals of the PTO’s invalidity decisions back to the PTO for further proceedings. VirnetX’s other remaining appeal of the PTO’s invalidity decisions remains pending with the Federal Circuit. The Company has accrued its best estimate for the ultimate resolution of these matters. Qualcomm On January 20, 2017, the Company filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm Incorporated and affiliated parties (“Qualcomm”) in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California seeking, among other things, to enjoin Qualcomm from requiring the Company to pay royalties at the rate demanded by Qualcomm. No Qualcomm-related royalty payments had been remitted by the Company to its contract manufacturers since the beginning of the second quarter of 2017. Following the Company’s lawsuit, Qualcomm filed patent infringement suits against the Company and its affiliates in the U.S. and various international jurisdictions, some of which sought to enjoin the sale of certain of the Company’s products in particular countries. Apple Inc. | Q3 2019 Form 10-Q | 22 On April 16, 2019, the Company and Qualcomm reached a settlement agreement to dismiss all litigation between the two companies worldwide. The companies also reached a multi-year license agreement and a multi-year supply agreement. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, Apple made a payment to Qualcomm to, among other things, resolve disputes over the withheld royalty payments. iOS Performance Management Cases Various civil litigation matters have been filed in state and federal courts in the U.S. and in various international jurisdictions alleging violation of consumer protection laws, fraud, computer intrusion and other causes of action related to the Company’s performance management feature used in its iPhone operating systems, introduced to certain iPhones in iOS updates 10.2.1 and 11.2. The claims seek monetary damages and other non-monetary relief. On April 5, 2018, several U.S. federal actions were consolidated through a Multidistrict Litigation process into a single action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. In addition to civil litigation, the Company is also responding to governmental investigations and requests for information relating to the performance management feature. The Company believes that its iPhones were not defective, that the performance management feature introduced with iOS updates 10.2.1 and 11.2 was intended to, and did, improve customers’ user experience, and that the Company did not make any misleading statements or fail to disclose any material information. The Company has accrued its best estimate for the ultimate resolution of these matters. Note 11 – Segment Information and Geographic Data The Company reports segment information based on the “management” approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company’s reportable segments. The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described in Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of the 2018 Form 10-K. The Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company’s retail stores located in those geographic locations. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the reportable segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as research and development, corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges and other separately managed general and administrative costs. The Company does not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes. Apple Inc. | Q3 2019 Form 10-Q | 23 The following table shows information by reportable segment for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 29, 2019 and June 30, 2018 (in millions): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended June 29, 2019 June 30, 2018 June 29, 2019 June 30, 2018 Americas: Net sales $ 25,056 $ 24,542 $ 87,592 $ 84,576 Operating income $ 7,442 $ 7,496 $ 26,329 $ 26,580 Europe: Net sales $ 11,925 $ 12,138 $ 45,342 $ 47,038 Operating income $ 3,687 $ 3,892 $ 14,371 $ 15,044 Greater China: Net sales $ 9,157 $ 9,551 $ 32,544 $ 40,531 Operating income $ 3,221 $ 3,414 $ 12,142 $ 15,285 Japan: Net sales $ 4,082 $ 3,867 $ 16,524 $ 16,572 Operating income $ 1,795 $ 1,765 $ 7,199 $ 7,193 Rest of Asia Pacific: Net sales $ 3,589 $ 3,167 $ 14,132 $ 13,978 Operating income $ 1,155 $ 1,127 $ 4,811 $ 4,980 A reconciliation of the Company’s segment operating income to the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 29, 2019 and June 30, 2018 is as follows (in millions): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended June 29, 2019 June 30, 2018 June 29, 2019 June 30, 2018 Segment operating income $ 17,300 $ 17,694 $ 64,852 $ 69,082 Research and development expense ( 4,257 ) ( 3,701 ) ( 12,107 ) ( 10,486 ) Other corporate expenses, net ( 1,499 ) ( 1,381 ) ( 4,440 ) ( 3,816 ) Total operating income $ 11,544 $ 12,612 $ 48,305 $ 54,780 Apple Inc. | Q3 2019 Form 10-Q | 24 Item 2.

Quarterly Highlights Business Seasonality and Product Introductions The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction. However, neither historical seasonal patterns nor historical patterns of product or service introductions should be considered reliable indicators of the Company’s future pattern of product or service introductions, future net sales or financial performance. Third Quarter Fiscal 2019 Highlights Total net sales increased 1% or $544 million during the third quarter of 2019 compared to the same quarter in 2018, primarily driven by higher Wearables, Home and Accessories and Services net sales, partially offset by lower iPhone net sales. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable impact on net sales during the third quarter of 2019. The Company announced iOS 13, macOS ® Catalina, watchOS ® 6 and tvOS ® 13, updates to its existing operating systems, and introduced iPadOS ™ , a new operating system designed for iPad, all of which are expected to be available in the fall of 2019. The Company also introduced an updated Mac Pro ® and an all-new Pro Display XDR, both of which are expected to be available in the fall of 2019. The Company repurchased $17.0 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $3.6 billion during the third quarter of 2019 . Apple Inc. | Q3 2019 Form 10-Q | 25 Products and Services Performance Beginning in the first quarter of 2019, the Company classified the amortization of the deferred value of Maps, Siri and free iCloud services, which are bundled in the sales price of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products, in services net sales. Historically, the Company classified the amortization of these amounts in products net sales consistent with its management reporting framework. As a result, products and services net sales information for the third quarter and first nine months of 2018 was reclassified to conform to the 2019 presentation. The following table shows net sales by category for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 29, 2019 and June 30, 2018 (dollars in millions): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended June 29, 2019 June 30, 2018 Change June 29, 2019 June 30, 2018 Change Net sales by category: iPhone (1) $ 25,986 $ 29,470 (12 )% $ 109,019 $ 128,133 (15 )% Mac (1) 5,820 5,258 11 % 18,749 17,858 5 % iPad (1) 5,023 4,634 8 % 16,624 14,397 15 % Wearables, Home and Accessories (1)(2) 5,525 3,733 48 % 17,962 13,158 37 % Services (3) 11,455 10,170 13 % 33,780 29,149 16 % Total net sales $ 53,809 $ 53,265 1 % $ 196,134 $ 202,695 (3 )% (1) Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are bundled in the sales price of the respective product.

Apple Inc. | Q3 2019 Form 10-Q | 27 Gross Margin Products and services gross margin and gross margin percentage for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 29, 2019 and June 30, 2018 were as follows (dollars in millions): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended June 29, 2019 June 30, 2018 June 29, 2019 June 30, 2018 Gross margin: Products $ 12,881 $ 14,139 $ 52,596 $ 60,079 Services 7,346 6,282 21,483 17,676 Total gross margin $ 20,227 $ 20,421 $ 74,079 $ 77,755 Gross margin percentage: Products 30.4 % 32.8 % 32.4 % 34.6 % Services 64.1 % 61.8 % 63.6 % 60.6 % Total gross margin percentage 37.6 % 38.3 % 37.8 % 38.4 % Products Gross Margin Products gross margin decreased during the third quarter of 2019 compared to the same quarter in 2018 due primarily to the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Products gross margin decreased during the first nine months of 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 due primarily to lower iPhone unit sales and the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Year-over-year products gross margin percentage decreased during the third quarter and first nine months of 2019 due primarily to the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the impact of lower iPhone unit sales on the Company’s products fixed cost structure. Services Gross Margin Services gross margin increased during the third quarter and first nine months of 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018 due primarily to higher services net sales. Year-over-year services gross margin percentage increased during the third quarter and first nine months of 2019 due primarily to leverage of the Company’s services fixed cost structure from higher services net sales and a different services mix. The Company anticipates total gross margin percentage during the fourth quarter of 2019 to be between 37.5% and 38.5%. The foregoing statement regarding the Company’s expected total gross margin percentage in the fourth quarter of 2019 is forward-looking and could differ from actual results. The Company’s future gross margins can be impacted by multiple factors including, but not limited to, those set forth in Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q under the heading “Risk Factors” and those described in this paragraph. In general, the Company believes gross margins will be subject to volatility and remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in response to such pressures; increased competition; the Company’s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and acquiring and delivering content for the Company’s services; the Company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; and costs associated with the Company’s frequent introductions and transitions of products and services. Apple Inc. | Q3 2019 Form 10-Q | 28 Operating Expenses Operating expenses for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 29, 2019 and June 30, 2018 were as follows (dollars in millions): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended June 29, 2019 June 30, 2018 June 29, 2019 June 30, 2018 Research and development $ 4,257 $ 3,701 $ 12,107 $ 10,486 Percentage of total net sales 8 % 7 % 6 % 5 % Selling, general and administrative $ 4,426 $ 4,108 $ 13,667 $ 12,489 Percentage of total net sales 8 % 8 % 7 % 6 % Total operating expenses $ 8,683 $ 7,809 $ 25,774 $ 22,975 Percentage of total net sales 16 % 15 % 13 % 11 % Research and Development The growth in research and development (“R&D”) expense during the third quarter of 2019 and first nine months of 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses. The Company continues to believe that focused investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace, and to the development of new and updated products and services that are central to the Company’s core business strategy. Selling, General and Administrative The growth in selling, general and administrative expense during the third quarter of 2019 compared to the same quarter in 2018 was driven primarily by higher spending on marketing and advertising and an increase in headcount-related expenses. The year-over-year growth in selling, general and administrative expense during the first nine months of 2019 was driven primarily by an increase in headcount-related expenses and higher spending on marketing and advertising and infrastructure-related costs. Other Income/(Expense), Net Other income/(expense), net for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 29, 2019 and June 30, 2018 was as follows (dollars in millions): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended June 29, 2019 June 30, 2018 Change June 29, 2019 June 30, 2018 Change Interest and dividend income $ 1,190 $ 1,418 $ 3,855 $ 4,375 Interest expense (866 ) (846 ) (2,766 ) (2,372 ) Other income/(expense), net 43 100 216 (301 ) Total other income/(expense), net $ 367 $ 672 (45 )% $ 1,305 $ 1,702 (23 )% The decrease in other income/(expense), net during the third quarter of 2019 compared to the same quarter in 2018 was due to lower interest income and the impact of foreign exchange–related items. The year-over-year decrease in other income/(expense), net during the first nine months of 2019 was due primarily to lower interest income and higher interest expense, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange–related items. The weighted-average interest rate earned by the Company on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was 2.17% and 2.25% in the third quarters of 2019 and 2018 , respectively, and 2.21% and 2.16% in the first nine months of 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Apple Inc. | Q3 2019 Form 10-Q | 29 Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 29, 2019 and June 30, 2018 were as follows (dollars in millions): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended June 29, 2019 June 30, 2018 June 29, 2019 June 30, 2018 Provision for income taxes $ 1,867 $ 1,765 $ 8,040 $ 11,076 Effective tax rate 15.7 % 13.3 % 16.2 % 19.6 % Statutory federal income tax rate 21.0 % 24.5 % 21.0 % 24.5 % The Company’s effective tax rate for the third quarter and first nine months of 2019 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to the lower tax rate on foreign earnings and tax benefits from share-based compensation. The Company’s effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2019 was higher compared to the same quarter in 2018 due primarily to higher taxes on foreign earnings, partially offset by a lower statutory federal income tax rate in 2019. The Company’s effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2019 was lower compared to the same period in 2018 due primarily to a lower statutory federal income tax rate in 2019. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Hedging In August 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities (“ASU 2017-12”). ASU 2017-12 expands component and fair value hedging, specifies the presentation of the effects of hedging instruments, and eliminates the separate measurement and presentation of hedge ineffectiveness. The Company will adopt ASU 2017-12 in its first quarter of 2020 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. Based on the Company’s derivative portfolio and hedging strategies, the adoption of ASU 2017-12 is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. Financial Instruments In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“ASU 2016-13”), which modifies the measurement of expected credit losses on certain financial instruments. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-13 in its first quarter of 2021 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. Based on the composition of the Company’s investment portfolio, current market conditions, and historical credit loss activity, the adoption of ASU 2016-13 is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. Leases In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (“ASU 2016-02”), which modifies lease accounting for lessees to increase transparency and comparability by recording lease assets and liabilities for operating leases and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-02 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method through a cumulative-effect adjustment at the beginning of its first quarter of 2020. While the Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2016-02, based on the lease portfolio as of June 29, 2019 , the Company anticipates recording lease assets and liabilities of approximately $9 billion on its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, with no material impact to its Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. However, the ultimate impact of adopting ASU 2016-02 will depend on the Company’s lease portfolio as of the adoption date. Apple Inc. | Q3 2019 Form 10-Q | 30 Liquidity and Capital Resources The following tables present selected financial information and statistics as of June 29, 2019 and September 29, 2018 and for the first nine months of 2019 and 2018 (in millions): June 29, 2019 September 29, 2018 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities (1) $ 210,610 $ 237,100 Property, plant and equipment, net $ 37,636 $ 41,304 Commercial paper $ 9,953 $ 11,964 Total term debt $ 98,465 $ 102,519 Working capital $ 45,269 $ 15,410 Nine Months Ended June 29, 2019 June 30, 2018 Cash generated by operating activities $ 49,481 $ 57,911 Cash generated by investing activities $ 46,694 $ 19,067 Cash used in financing activities $ (69,937 ) $ (65,296 ) (1) As of June 29, 2019 and September 29, 2018 , total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities included $19.5 billion and $20.3 billion , respectively, that was restricted from general use, related to the State Aid Decision (refer to Note 5, “Income Taxes” in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q) and other agreements. The Company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, along with commercial paper and other short-term liquidity arrangements, will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital asset purchases, dividends, share repurchases, debt repayments and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months. In connection with the State Aid Decision, as of June 29, 2019 , the entire recovery amount of €13.1 billion plus interest of €1.2 billion was funded into escrow, where it will remain restricted from general use pending conclusion of all appeals. The Company’s marketable securities investment portfolio is primarily invested in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company’s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. During the nine months ended June 29, 2019 , cash generated by operating activities of $49.5 billion was a result of $41.6 billion of net income and non-cash adjustments to net income of $13.6 billion , partially offset by a decrease in the net change in operating assets and liabilities of $5.6 billion .

During the nine months ended June 30, 2018 , cash generated by operating activities of $57.9 billion was a result of $45.4 billion of net income and an increase in the net change in operating assets and liabilities of $33.9 billion , partially offset by non-cash adjustments to net income of $21.4 billion . Cash generated by investing activities of $19.1 billion during the nine months ended June 30, 2018 consisted primarily of proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities, net of purchases, of $31.8 billion , partially offset by cash used to acquire property, plant and equipment of $10.3 billion . Cash used in financing activities of $65.3 billion during the nine months ended June 30, 2018 consisted primarily of cash used to repurchase common stock of $53.6 billion , cash used to pay dividends and dividend equivalents of $10.2 billion and cash used to repay term debt of $6.5 billion , partially offset by net proceeds from the issuance of term debt of $7.0 billion . Capital Assets The Company’s capital expenditures were $4.9 billion during the first nine months of 2019 . The Company anticipates utilizing approximately $10.0 billion for capital expenditures during 2019 , which includes product tooling and manufacturing process equipment; data centers; corporate facilities and infrastructure, including information systems hardware, software and enhancements; and retail store facilities. Apple Inc. | Q3 2019 Form 10-Q | 31 Debt The Company issues unsecured short-term promissory notes (“Commercial Paper”) pursuant to a commercial paper program.

In addition, the Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into foreign currency swaps to manage foreign currency risk on the Notes. Further information regarding the Company’s debt issuances and related hedging activity can be found in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 3, “Financial Instruments” and Note 6, “Debt.” Capital Return Program On April 30, 2019, the Company announced the Board of Directors increased the current share repurchase program authorization from $100 billion to $175 billion of the Company’s common stock, of which $78.2 billion had been utilized as of June 29, 2019 . During the nine months ended June 29, 2019 , the Company repurchased 252.6 million shares of its common stock for $49.2 billion , including 55.1 million shares initially delivered under a $12.0 billion accelerated share repurchase arrangement (“ASR”) dated February 2019. The Company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. Under this program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act. On April 30, 2019, the Company also announced the Board of Directors raised the Company’s quarterly cash dividend from $0.73 to $0.77 per share, beginning with the dividend paid during the third quarter of 2019. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. Contractual Obligations Operating Leases As of June 29, 2019 , the Company’s total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases were $11.1 billion . The Company’s retail store and other facility leases typically have original terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multi-year renewal options. Manufacturing Purchase Obligations The Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture sub-assemblies for the Company’s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. These outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days . The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. As of June 29, 2019 , the Company expects to pay $29.8 billion under manufacturing-related supplier arrangements, which are primarily noncancelable. Other Purchase Obligations The Company’s other purchase obligations consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and noncancelable obligations related to advertising, licensing, R&D, internet and telecommunications services, content creation and other activities. As of June 29, 2019 , the Company had other purchase obligations of $6.3 billion. Other Non-Current Liabilities As of June 29, 2019 , a significant portion of the other non-current liabilities in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet consisted of the $30.5 billion deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”). The Company plans to pay the deemed repatriation tax payable in installments in accordance with the Act. The Company’s remaining other non-current liabilities primarily consist of items for which the Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments. Apple Inc. | Q3 2019 Form 10-Q | 32 Indemnification Agreements entered into by the Company may include indemnification provisions, which may subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to indemnification of third parties. The Company offers an iPhone Upgrade Program, which is available to customers who purchase a qualifying iPhone in the U.S., the U.K. and mainland China. The iPhone Upgrade Program provides customers the right to trade in that iPhone for a specified amount when purchasing a new iPhone, provided certain conditions are met. The Company accounts for the trade-in right as a guarantee liability and recognizes arrangement revenue net of the fair value of such right, with subsequent changes to the guarantee liability recognized within net sales. The Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers. Under these agreements, the Company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers of the Company, and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim. While the Company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates, and such differences may be material. Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of the 2018 Form 10-K, and “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in Part II, Item 7 of the 2018 Form 10-K describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements. With the exception of Revenue Recognition and Impairment of Marketable Debt Securities, there have been no material changes to the Company’s critical accounting policies and estimates since the 2018 Form 10-K. Revenue Recognition The Company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud, Siri and Maps. The third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (“SSP”). Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company’s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided. The Company’s process for determining estimated SSPs involves management’s judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. Should future facts and circumstances change, the Company’s SSPs and the future rate of related amortization for unspecified software upgrades and services related to future sales of these devices could change. Factors subject to change include the nature of the unspecified software upgrade rights and product-related bundled services offered, their estimated value and the estimated period they are expected to be provided. Apple Inc. | Q3 2019 Form 10-Q | 33 Impairment of Marketable Debt Securities The Company’s investments in marketable debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value. The Company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine if any security is other-than-temporarily impaired, which would require the Company to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made. In making this determination, the Company evaluates, among other things, the duration and extent to which the fair value of a security is less than its cost; the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto; and the Company’s intent to sell, or whether it will more likely than not be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. The Company’s assessment of whether an available-for-sale debt security is other-than-temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular security, which would have an adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk There have been no material changes to the Company’s market risk during the first nine months of 2019 . For a discussion of the Company’s exposure to market risk, refer to the Company’s market risk disclosures set forth in Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” of the 2018 Form 10-K. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act were effective as of June 29, 2019 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the third quarter of 2019 , which were identified in connection with management’s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Apple Inc. | Q3 2019 Form 10-Q | 34 PART II — OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings The Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. Except as described in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, “Commitments and Contingencies” under the heading “Contingencies,” in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Refer to the risk factor “ The Company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings, such as being found to have infringed on intellectual property rights ” in Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q under the heading “Risk Factors.” The Company settled certain matters during the third quarter of 2019 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating results. Item 1A. Risk Factors The following description of risk factors includes any material changes to, and supersedes the description of, risk factors associated with the Company’s business previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of the 2018 Form 10-K and in Part II, Item 1A of the Forms 10-Q for the quarters ended December 29, 2018 and March 30, 2019, in each case under the heading “Risk Factors.” The business, financial condition and operating results of the Company can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described below, any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly, cause the Company’s actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from past, or from anticipated future, financial condition and operating results. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, operating results and stock price. The following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. These risk factors may be important to understanding other statements in this Form 10-Q. The following information should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part I, Item 1, “Financial Statements” and Part I, Item 2, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Form 10-Q. Because of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company’s financial condition and operating results, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. Global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and growth . The Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’s total net sales. In addition, a majority of the Company’s supply chain, and its manufacturing and assembly activities, are located outside the U.S. As a result, the Company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions. Adverse macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, slower growth or recession, new or increased tariffs, changes to fiscal and monetary policy, tighter credit, higher interest rates, high unemployment and currency fluctuations could materially adversely affect demand for the Company’s products and services. In addition, consumer confidence and spending could be adversely affected in response to financial market volatility, negative financial news, conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets, declines in income or asset values, changes to fuel and other energy costs, labor and healthcare costs and other economic factors. In addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company’s products, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic conditions could have a significant impact on the Company’s suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners. Potential effects include financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance operations and purchases of the Company’s products; and insolvency. A downturn in the economic environment could also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company’s trade receivables; the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the Company’s ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair value of the Company’s financial instruments. These and other economic factors could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and growth. Apple Inc. | Q3 2019 Form 10-Q | 35 Global markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets. The Company’s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price/performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. The Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in R&D. There can be no assurance that these investments will achieve expected returns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully. The Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to register, numerous patents, trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and emulating the Company’s products and infringing on its intellectual property. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the Company’s intellectual property, the Company’s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be adversely affected. The Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, tablet and personal computer markets. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors may have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. Additionally, the Company faces significant competition as competitors attempt to imitate the Company’s product features and applications within their own products or, alternatively, collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the Company’s approach to providing components seamlessly within their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions. Some of the markets in which the Company competes have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted. In addition, an increasing number of internet-enabled devices that include software applications and are smaller, simpler and cheaper than traditional personal computers compete with some of the Company’s existing products. The Company’s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company’s financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the Company’s ability to continually improve its products and services in order to maintain their functional and design advantages. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively. To remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services. Due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services. The success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors including, but not limited to, timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company’s ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for new products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies. Accordingly, the Company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product and service introductions and transitions. Apple Inc. | Q3 2019 Form 10-Q | 36 The Company depends on the performance of carriers, wholesalers, retailers and other resellers. The Company distributes its products through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers, many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers. The Company also sells its products and third-party products in most of its major markets directly to education, enterprise and government customers and consumers and small and mid-sized businesses through its retail and online stores. Some carriers providing cellular network service for iPhone offer financing, installment payment plans or subsidies for users’ purchases of the device. There is no assurance that such offers will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the Company’s agreements with these carriers or in agreements the Company enters into with new carriers. The Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers’ stores with Company employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays. These programs could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental sales. The financial condition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Company’s products, or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the Company’s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company’s products. The Company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk. The Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers’ facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable, no assurance can be given that the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes. The Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. Manufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company’s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for periods up to 150 days . Because the Company’s markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments. Future operating results depend upon the Company’s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms. Because the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that could materially adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and operating results. While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms. The effects of global or regional economic conditions on the Company’s suppliers, described in “ Global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and growth ” above, also could affect the Company’s ability to obtain components . Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results. The Company’s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements. If the Company’s supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company’s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. The Company’s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Apple Inc. | Q3 2019 Form 10-Q | 37 The Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of which are located outside of the U.S. Substantially all of the Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia. A significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements may lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company’s direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished control may have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products or services, or the Company’s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, the Company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect or warranty liability. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, material violations of the supplier code of conduct could occur. The Company relies on single-sourced outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many components, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company’s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform may have a negative impact on the Company’s cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations may be disrupted for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, military actions, economic, business, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, or international trade disputes. The Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply could be reduced or terminated and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments could be negatively impacted. The Company’s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the Company’s business and result in harm to the Company’s reputation. The Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the Company, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products. Defects may also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects could make the Company’s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the Company’s products are introduced into specialized applications, including healthcare. In addition, the Company’s service offerings may have quality issues and from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, the Company’s services may not perform as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software and services it offers. Failure to do so could result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the Company’s products and services. In addition, the Company may be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property, plant and equipment, and/or intangible assets, and significant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems could also adversely affect the experience for users of the Company’s products and services, and result in harm to the Company’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales. The Company relies on access to third-party digital content, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell currently available music, movies, TV shows and books. The licensing or other distribution arrangements with these third parties are for relatively short terms and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on reasonable terms, if at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content in the future. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company’s access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules, or continue to expand its geographic reach. Failure to obtain the right to make third-party digital content available, or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results. Some third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. If requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There is no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner. In addition, certain countries have passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force the Company to license its digital rights management, which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could negatively affect arrangements with the Company’s content providers. Apple Inc. | Q3 2019 Form 10-Q | 38 The Company’s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers. The Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications and services. There is no assurance that third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the Company’s products. If third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company’s products, customers may choose not to buy the Company’s products. The Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers’ perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the Company’s products compared to competitors’ platforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets and Windows for personal computers. This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of product sales and the costs of developing such applications and services. The Company’s minority market share in the global smartphone, tablet and personal computer markets could make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company’s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors’ products with larger market share. If developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company’s devices may suffer. The Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products. The Company’s products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and if third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, third-party applications might not take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences or might not operate correctly and may result in dissatisfied customers. The Company sells and delivers third-party applications for its products through the App Store, Mac App Store and TV App Store. The Company retains a commission from sales through these platforms. If developers reduce their use of these platforms to distribute their applications and offer in-app purchases to customers, then the volume of sales, and the commission that the Company earns on those sales, would decrease. The Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Many of the Company’s products include third-party intellectual property, which requires licenses from those third parties. Based on past experience and industry practice, the Company believes such licenses generally can be obtained on reasonable terms. There is, however, no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, could preclude the Company from selling certain products or services, or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results. The Company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings, such as being found to have infringed on intellectual property rights . The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved, and new claims may arise in the future. In addition, agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which may subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. Claims against the Company based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights have generally increased over time and may continue to increase. In particular, the Company has historically faced a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled products, and new claims may arise in the future. For example, technology and other patent-holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in a number of U.S. jurisdictions and before the U.S. International Trade Commission, as well as internationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages. Regardless of the merit of particular claims, litigation may be expensive, time consuming, disruptive to the Company’s operations and distracting to management. In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into licensing agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such disputes. No assurance can be given that such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These agreements may also significantly increase the Company’s cost of sales and operating expenses. Apple Inc. | Q3 2019 Form 10-Q | 39 Except as described in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, “Commitments and Contingencies” under the heading “Contingencies,” in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims, including matters related to infringement of intellectual property rights. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome could result in significant compensatory, punitive or trebled monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results. While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise. The Company is subject to laws and regulations worldwide, changes to which could increase the Company’s costs and individually or in the aggregate adversely affect the Company’s business. The Company is subject to laws and regulations affecting its domestic and international operations in a number of areas. These U.S. and foreign laws and regulations affect the Company’s activities in areas including, but not limited to, labor, advertising, digital content, availability of third-party software applications and services, consumer protection, real estate, billing, e-commerce, promotions, quality of services, telecommunications, mobile communications and media, television and film, intellectual property ownership and infringement, tax, import and export requirements, anti-corruption, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy and data localization requirements, anti-competition, environmental, health and safety. By way of example, laws and regulations related to mobile communications and media devices in the many jurisdictions in which the Company operates are extensive and subject to change. Such changes could include, among others, restrictions on the production, manufacture, distribution and use of devices, locking devices to a carrier’s network, or mandating the use of devices on more than one carrier’s network. These devices are also subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies, as well as by cellular network carriers for use on their networks. These certification processes are extensive and time consuming, and could result in additional testing requirements, product modifications, or delays in product shipment dates, or could preclude the Company from selling certain products. Compliance with these laws, regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive, and they may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, further increasing the cost of compliance and doing business. Any such costs, which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation, could individually or in the aggregate make the Company’s products and services less attractive to the Company’s customers, delay the introduction of new products and services in one or more regions, or cause the Company to change or limit its business practices. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that the Company’s employees, contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company’s policies and procedures. The Company’s business is subject to the risks of international operations. The Company derives a majority of its net sales and earnings from its international operations. Compliance with applicable U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, such as import and export requirements, anti-corruption laws, tax laws, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy and data localization requirements, environmental laws, labor laws and anti-competition regulations, increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. Although the Company has implemented policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations, a violation by the Company’s employees, contractors or agents could nevertheless occur. In some cases, compliance with the laws and regulations of one country could violate the laws and regulations of another country. Violations of these laws and regulations could materially adversely affect the Company’s brand, international growth efforts and business. The Company also could be significantly affected by other risks associated with international activities including, but not limited to, economic and labor conditions, increased duties, taxes and other costs, political instability and international trade disputes. Gross margins on the Company’s products in foreign countries, and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, could be materially adversely affected by international trade regulations, including duties, tariffs and antidumping penalties. The Company is also exposed to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables with customers in certain international markets. There can be no assurance the Company can effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses. Apple Inc. | Q3 2019 Form 10-Q | 40 The Company’s retail stores have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. The Company’s retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory and personnel. The Company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space. Certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than the Company’s more typical retail stores. Due to the high cost structure associated with the Company’s retail stores, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance costs. The Company’s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the Company’s financial condition and operating results, including macro-economic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity. Other factors include, but are not limited to, the Company’s ability to manage costs associated with retail store construction and operation; manage relationships with existing retail partners; manage costs associated with fluctuations in the value of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost. Investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company’s ongoing business and present risks not originally contemplated. The Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater than expected liabilities and expenses, inadequate return of capital and unidentified issues not discovered in the Company’s due diligence. These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful. The Company’s business and reputation may be impacted by information technology system failures or network disruptions. The Company may be subject to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, or other events or disruptions. System redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company’s business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions could adversely impact the Company’s business by, among other things, preventing access to the Company’s online services, interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the Company’s products. These events could materially adversely affect the Company’s reputation, financial condition and operating results. There may be losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personally identifiable information, that could subject the Company to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences. The Company’s business requires it to use and store confidential information including, among other things, personally identifiable information (“PII”) with respect to the Company’s customers and employees. The Company devotes significant resources to network and data security, including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data. But these measures cannot provide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the Company’s reputation, financial condition and operating results. The Company’s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties. Although the Company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to third parties, such measures are not always effective and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the Company’s reputation, financial condition and operating results. For example, the Company may experience a security breach impacting the Company’s information technology systems that compromises the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential information. Such an incident could, among other things, impair the Company’s ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services, impact the Company’s stock price, materially damage supplier relationships, and expose the Company to litigation or government investigations, which could result in penalties, fines or judgments against the Company. Although malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information, including PII, affect many companies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and processes. Apple Inc. | Q3 2019 Form 10-Q | 41 The Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data, including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies. As with all companies, these security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty password management or other irregularities. For example, third parties attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names, passwords or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access the Company’s information technology systems. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, may result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the Company’s products and services. In addition to the risks relating to general confidential information described above, the Company may also be subject to specific obligations relating to health data and payment card data. Health data may be subject to additional privacy, security and breach notification requirements, and the Company may be subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the Company’s compliance with these obligations. If the Company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements, or if health data is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the Company’s agreements with healthcare institutions, the Company could be subject to litigation or government investigations, may be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and could also incur significant fees or fines. Under payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder information is potentially compromised, the Company could be liable for associated investigatory expenses and could also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards. The Company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards, which would materially adversely affect the Company’s reputation, financial condition and operating results. While the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise. The Company’s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding data protection. The Company is subject to federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of PII. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also may restrict transfers of PII among the Company and its international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the Company to incur substantial costs or require the Company to change its business practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability. The Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of PII through its privacy policy, information provided on its website and press statements. Any failure by the Company to comply with these public statements or with other federal, state or international privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. In addition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability. The Company’s success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key personnel. Much of the Company’s future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly skilled employees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley, where most of the Company’s key personnel are located. The Company’s business may be impacted by political events, international trade disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions. Political events, international trade disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions could harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners. International trade disputes could result in tariffs and other protectionist measures that could adversely affect the Company’s business. Tariffs could increase the cost of the Company’s products and the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs could adversely impact the gross margin that the Company earns on its products. Tariffs could also make the Company’s products more expensive for customers, which could make the Company’s products less competitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also adopt other protectionist measures that could limit the Company’s ability to offer its products and services. Political uncertainty surrounding international trade disputes and protectionist measures could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company’s business. Apple Inc. | Q3 2019 Form 10-Q | 42 Many of the Company’s operations and facilities as well as critical business operations of the Company’s suppliers and contract manufacturers are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, labor disputes, public health issues and other events beyond the Company’s control. Global climate change could result in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Such events could make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company’s supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company’s service offerings. Following an interruption to its business, the Company could require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures in order to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company. The Company’s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While the Company’s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in disruption to the Company’s business and harm to the Company’s reputation. Should major public health issues, including pandemics, arise, the Company could be adversely affected by more stringent employee travel restrictions, additional limitations in freight services, governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions, delays in production ramps of new products, and disruptions in the operations of the Company’s suppliers and contract manufacturers. The Company expects its quarterly net sales and operating results to fluctuate. The Company’s profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For example, gross margins on the Company’s hardware products vary across product lines and can change over time as a result of product transitions, pricing and configuration changes, and component, warranty and other cost fluctuations. The Company’s financial results may be materially adversely impacted as a result of shifts in the mix of products and services that the Company sells; shifts in the geographic, currency or channel mix of the Company’s sales; component cost increases; increases in the cost of acquiring and delivering content for the Company’s services; price competition; or the introduction of new products or services, including new products or services with higher cost structures. The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a majority of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company’s products or services, issues with new product or service introductions, information technology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company’s logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners. The Company’s stock price is subject to volatility. The Company’s stock price has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, the Company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies’ operating performance. Price volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its own stock to exceed the stock’s price at a given point in time. The Company believes its stock price should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability. The Company also believes its stock price should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow, and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Company’s Board of Directors, and the Company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, its stock price may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention. The Company’s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies. The Company’s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non–U.S. dollar–denominated sales, cost of sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company’s products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company’s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar’s strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency–denominated sales. Apple Inc. | Q3 2019 Form 10-Q | 43 Conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Company’s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins. The Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place. The Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio. The Company’s investments can be negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and economic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results. The Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen. The Company distributes its products through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. The Company also sells its products directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the Company’s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance. The Company’s exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of June 29, 2019 , a significant portion of the Company’s trade receivables was concentrated within cellular network carriers, and its vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses. The Company could be subject to changes in its tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. The Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland, where a number of the Company’s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. The Company’s effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including in the U.S. and Ireland. The Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company’s effective tax rates were to increase, particularly in the U.S. or Ireland, or if the ultimate determination of the Company’s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company’s financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.

The remaining $96.8 billion in the table represents the amount available to repurchase shares under the authorized repurchase program as of June 29, 2019 . The Company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. Under this program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act. Item 3.

Apple Inc. | Q2 2019 Form 10-Q | 5 Apple Inc. Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation and Preparation The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively “Apple” or the “Company”). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. In the opinion of the Company’s management, the condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation. These condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the Company’s annual consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2018 (the “ 2018 Form 10-K”). The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. A 14th week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. The Company’s fiscal years 2019 and 2018 span 52 weeks each. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Revenue Recognition In the first quarter of 2019, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (the “FASB”) Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (“ASU 2014-09”), and additional ASUs issued to clarify the guidance in ASU 2014-09 (collectively the “new revenue standard”), which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. The Company adopted the new revenue standard utilizing the full retrospective transition method. The Company did not restate total net sales in the prior periods presented, as adoption of the new revenue standard did not have a material impact on previously reported amounts. Additionally, beginning in the first quarter of 2019, the Company classified the amortization of the deferred value of Maps, Siri ® and free iCloud ® services, which are bundled in the sales price of iPhone ® , Mac ® , iPad ® and certain other products, in services net sales. Historically, the Company classified the amortization of these amounts in products net sales consistent with its management reporting framework. As a result, products and services net sales information for the second quarter and first six months of 2018 was reclassified to conform to the 2019 presentation. Financial Instruments In the first quarter of 2019, the Company adopted FASB ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments – Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (“ASU 2016-01”), which updates certain aspects of the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. The adoption of ASU 2016-01 did not have a material impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements. Income Taxes In the first quarter of 2019, the Company adopted FASB ASU No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory (“ASU 2016-16”), which requires the recognition of the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs. The Company adopted ASU 2016-16 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. Upon adoption, the Company recorded $ 2.7 billion of net deferred tax assets, reduced other non-current assets by $ 128 million , and increased retained earnings by $ 2.6 billion on its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company will recognize incremental deferred income tax expense as these net deferred tax assets are utilized. Restricted Cash In the first quarter of 2019, the Company adopted FASB ASU No. 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash (“ASU 2016-18”), which enhances and clarifies the guidance on the classification and presentation of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows and requires additional disclosures about restricted cash balances. Apple Inc. | Q2 2019 Form 10-Q | 6 Earnings Per Share The following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the three- and six-month periods ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018 (net income in millions and shares in thousands): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended March 30, 2019 March 31, 2018 March 30, 2019 March 31, 2018 Numerator: Net income $ 11,561 $ 13,822 $ 31,526 $ 33,887 Denominator: Weighted-average basic shares outstanding 4,674,071 5,024,877 4,704,945 5,068,877 Effect of dilutive securities 26,575 43,616 32,004 44,263 Weighted-average diluted shares 4,700,646 5,068,493 4,736,949 5,113,140 Basic earnings per share $ 2.47 $ 2.75 $ 6.70 $ 6.69 Diluted earnings per share $ 2.46 $ 2.73 $ 6.66 $ 6.63 Potentially dilutive securities representing 31.1 million and 30.0 million shares of common stock were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for the three- and six-month periods ended March 30, 2019 , respectively, because their effect would have been antidilutive. Restricted Cash and Restricted Marketable Securities The Company considers cash and marketable securities to be restricted when withdrawal or general use is legally restricted. The Company records restricted cash as other assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, and determines current or non-current classification based on the expected duration of the restriction. The Company records restricted marketable securities as current or non-current marketable securities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets based on the classification of the underlying securities. Note 2 – Revenue Recognition Net sales consist of revenue from the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad, services and other products. The Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is transferred to its customers. Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company’s products net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company’s services net sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered. Payment for products and services net sales is collected within a short period of time following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable. The Company records reductions to products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer incentive programs based on the Company’s expectations and historical experience. For arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are capable of being distinct, the Company allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (“SSP”). When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine the SSP. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are established that reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company’s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation. Apple Inc. | Q2 2019 Form 10-Q | 7 The Company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud, Siri and Maps. The third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company’s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided. Cost of sales related to delivered hardware and bundled software, including estimated warranty costs, are recognized at the time of sale. Costs incurred to provide product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights are recognized as cost of sales as incurred. For certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For these arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized revenue, and has elected not to disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services. For the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products including, but not limited to, evaluating if it has the ability to establish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party applications sold through the App Store ® , Mac App Store and TV App Store and certain digital content sold through the iTunes Store ® , the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for such sales on a net basis by recognizing in services net sales only the commission it retains. The Company has elected to record revenue net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities, with the collected taxes recorded within other current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority. Deferred Revenue As of March 30, 2019 and September 29, 2018 , the Company had total deferred revenue of $ 8.2 billion and $ 8.8 billion , respectively. As of March 30, 2019 , the Company expects 67 % of total deferred revenue to be realized in less than a year, 26 % within one-to-two years, 6 % within two-to-three years and 1 % in greater than three years. Disaggregated Revenue Net sales disaggregated by significant products and services for the three- and six-month periods ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018 were as follows (in millions): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended March 30, 2019 March 31, 2018 March 30, 2019 March 31, 2018 iPhone (1) $ 31,051 $ 37,559 $ 83,033 $ 98,663 Mac (1) 5,513 5,776 12,929 12,600 iPad (1) 4,872 4,008 11,601 9,763 Wearables, Home and Accessories (1)(2) 5,129 3,944 12,437 9,425 Services (3) 11,450 9,850 22,325 18,979 Total net sales (4) $ 58,015 $ 61,137 $ 142,325 $ 149,430 (1) Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are bundled in the sales price of the respective product. (2) Wearables, Home and Accessories net sales include sales of AirPods®, Apple TV®, Apple Watch®, Beats® products, HomePod™, iPod touch® and Apple-branded and third-party accessories. (3) Services net sales include sales from the Company’s digital content stores and streaming services, AppleCare®, Apple Pay®, licensing and other services. Services net sales also include amortization of the deferred value of Maps, Siri and free iCloud services, which are bundled in the sales price of certain products. (4) Includes $ 1.9 billion and $ 2.2 billion of revenue recognized in the three months ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018 , respectively, and $ 3.8 billion and $ 3.5 billion of revenue recognized in the six months ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018 , respectively, that was included in deferred revenue at the beginning of each respective period. Apple Inc. | Q2 2019 Form 10-Q | 8 The Company’s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable segment in Note 11, “Segment Information and Geographic Data” for the three- and six-month periods ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018 . Note 3 – Financial Instruments Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities The Company’s investments in marketable debt securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. The Company classifies its marketable debt securities as either short-term or long-term based on each instrument’s underlying contractual maturity date. Unrealized gains and losses on marketable debt securities classified as available-for-sale are recognized in other comprehensive income/(loss) (“OCI”). The Company’s investments in marketable equity securities are classified based on the nature of the securities and their availability for use in current operations. The Company’s marketable equity securities are measured at fair value with gains and losses recognized in other income/(expense), net. The following tables show the Company’s cash and marketable securities by significant investment category as of March 30, 2019 and September 29, 2018 (in millions): March 30, 2019 Adjusted Cost Unrealized Gains Unrealized Losses Fair Value Cash and Cash Equivalents Short-Term Marketable Securities Long-Term Marketable Securities Cash $ 11,751 $ — $ — $ 11,751 $ 11,751 $ — $ — Level 1 (1) : Money market funds 8,719 — — 8,719 8,719 — — Subtotal 8,719 — — 8,719 8,719 — — Level 2 (2) : U.S. Treasury securities 48,215 6 ( 401 ) 47,820 8,815 6,957 32,048 U.S. agency securities 6,458 — ( 19 ) 6,439 4,354 526 1,559 Non-U.S. government securities 21,572 132 ( 108 ) 21,596 243 3,992 17,361 Certificates of deposit and time deposits 3,472 — — 3,472 1,980 1,372 120 Commercial paper 2,150 — — 2,150 2,122 28 — Corporate debt securities 106,837 228 ( 730 ) 106,335 4 28,164 78,167 Municipal securities 946 4 ( 2 ) 948 — 75 873 Mortgage- and asset-backed securities 16,438 15 ( 272 ) 16,181 — 990 15,191 Subtotal 206,088 385 ( 1,532 ) 204,941 17,518 42,104 145,319 Total (3) $ 226,558 $ 385 $ ( 1,532 ) $ 225,411 $ 37,988 $ 42,104 $ 145,319 Apple Inc. | Q2 2019 Form 10-Q | 9 September 29, 2018 Adjusted Cost Unrealized Gains Unrealized Losses Fair Value Cash and Cash Equivalents Short-Term Marketable Securities Long-Term Marketable Securities Cash $ 11,575 $ — $ — $ 11,575 $ 11,575 $ — $ — Level 1 (1) : Money market funds 8,083 — — 8,083 8,083 — — Mutual funds 799 — ( 116 ) 683 — 683 — Subtotal 8,882 — ( 116 ) 8,766 8,083 683 — Level 2 (2) : U.S. Treasury securities 47,296 — ( 1,202 ) 46,094 1,613 7,606 36,875 U.S. agency securities 4,127 — ( 48 ) 4,079 1,732 360 1,987 Non-U.S. government securities 21,601 49 ( 250 ) 21,400 — 3,355 18,045 Certificates of deposit and time deposits 3,074 — — 3,074 1,247 1,330 497 Commercial paper 2,573 — — 2,573 1,663 910 — Corporate debt securities 123,001 152 ( 2,038 ) 121,115 — 25,162 95,953 Municipal securities 946 — ( 12 ) 934 — 178 756 Mortgage- and asset-backed securities 18,105 8 ( 623 ) 17,490 — 804 16,686 Subtotal 220,723 209 ( 4,173 ) 216,759 6,255 39,705 170,799 Total (3) $ 241,180 $ 209 $ ( 4,289 ) $ 237,100 $ 25,913 $ 40,388 $ 170,799 (1) Level 1 fair value estimates are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

(3) As of March 30, 2019 and September 29, 2018 , total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities included $ 19.3 billion and $ 20.3 billion , respectively, that was restricted from general use, related to the State Aid Decision (refer to Note 5, “Income Taxes”) and other agreements. The Company may sell certain of its marketable debt securities prior to their stated maturities for reasons including, but not limited to, managing liquidity, credit risk, duration and asset allocation. The maturities of the Company’s long-term marketable debt securities generally range from one to five years . The following tables show information about the Company’s marketable securities that had been in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than 12 months and for 12 months or greater as of March 30, 2019 and September 29, 2018 (in millions): March 30, 2019 Continuous Unrealized Losses Less than 12 Months 12 Months or Greater Total Fair value of marketable debt securities $ 18,814 $ 131,393 $ 150,207 Unrealized losses $ ( 87 ) $ ( 1,445 ) $ ( 1,532 ) September 29, 2018 Continuous Unrealized Losses Less than 12 Months 12 Months or Greater Total Fair value of marketable securities $ 126,238 $ 60,599 $ 186,837 Unrealized losses $ ( 2,400 ) $ ( 1,889 ) $ ( 4,289 ) Apple Inc. | Q2 2019 Form 10-Q | 10 The Company typically invests in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company’s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. Fair values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. When evaluating a marketable debt security for other-than-temporary impairment, the Company reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below its cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto, changes in market interest rates and the Company’s intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the security before recovery of the security’s cost basis. As of March 30, 2019 , the Company does not consider any of its marketable debt securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired. Non-Marketable Securities The Company holds non-marketable equity securities of certain privately held companies without readily determinable fair values, and has elected to apply the measurement alternative. As such, the Company’s non-marketable equity securities are measured at cost, less any impairment, and are adjusted for changes in fair value resulting from observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. Gains and losses on non-marketable equity securities are recognized in other income/(expense), net. As of March 30, 2019 , the Company’s non-marketable equity securities had a carrying value of $ 2.3 billion . The Company holds a non-marketable debt security that is classified and accounted for as held-to-maturity. As of March 30, 2019 , the Company’s non-marketable debt security had an amortized cost basis and carrying value of $ 1.5 billion . Restricted Cash A reconciliation of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet to cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows as of March 30, 2019 is as follows (in millions): March 30, 2019 Cash and cash equivalents $ 37,988 Restricted cash included in other current assets 341 Restricted cash included in other non-current assets 1,488 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 39,817 The Company’s restricted cash primarily consisted of cash required to be on deposit under a contractual agreement with a bank to support the Company’s iPhone Upgrade Program. Derivative Financial Instruments The Company may use derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risk on expected future cash flows, net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries, and certain existing assets and liabilities. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign currency exchange or interest rates. To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar may hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue, and subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar may hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries’ functional currencies. The Company may enter into forward contracts, option contracts or other instruments to manage this risk and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months . To protect the net investment in a foreign operation from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset a portion of the changes in the carrying amounts of these investments due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, the Company may use non-derivative financial instruments, such as its foreign currency–denominated debt, as hedges of its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries. In both of these cases, the Company designates these instruments as net investment hedges. Apple Inc. | Q2 2019 Form 10-Q | 11 To protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. These instruments may offset a portion of the foreign currency remeasurement gains or losses, or changes in fair value. The Company may designate these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of March 30, 2019 , the Company’s hedged term debt– and marketable securities–related foreign currency transactions are expected to be recognized within 23 years . The Company may also enter into non-designated foreign currency contracts to offset a portion of the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. To protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. These instruments may offset a portion of the changes in interest income or expense, or changes in fair value. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of March 30, 2019 , the Company’s hedged interest rate transactions are expected to be recognized within 9 years . Cash Flow Hedges The effective portions of cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (“AOCI”) until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of foreign currency revenue are recognized as a component of net sales in the same period as the related revenue is recognized, and deferred gains and losses related to cash flow hedges of inventory purchases are recognized as a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related costs are recognized. Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of interest income or expense are recognized in other income/(expense), net in the same period as the related income or expense is recognized. For options designated as cash flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. The ineffective portions and amounts excluded from the effectiveness testing of cash flow hedges are recognized in other income/(expense), net. Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially identified time period or within a subsequent two-month time period. Deferred gains and losses in AOCI associated with such derivative instruments are reclassified into other income/(expense), net in the period of de-designation. Any subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are reflected in other income/(expense), net unless they are re-designated as hedges of other transactions. Net Investment Hedges The effective portions of net investment hedges are recorded in OCI as a part of the cumulative translation adjustment. The ineffective portions and amounts excluded from the effectiveness testing of net investment hedges are recognized in other income/(expense), net. For foreign exchange forward contracts designated as net investment hedges, the Company excludes changes in fair value relating to changes in the forward carry component from its assessment of hedge effectiveness. Accordingly, any gains or losses related to this forward carry component are recognized in earnings in the current period. Fair Value Hedges Gains and losses related to changes in fair value hedges are recognized in earnings along with a corresponding loss or gain related to the change in value of the underlying hedged item in the same line in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. For foreign exchange forward contracts designated as fair value hedges, the Company excludes changes in fair value relating to changes in the forward carry component from its assessment of hedge effectiveness. Amounts excluded from the effectiveness testing of fair value hedges were gains of $ 206 million and $ 474 million for the three- and six-month periods ended March 30, 2019 , respectively, and were recognized in other income/(expense), net. Non-Designated Derivatives Derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are adjusted to fair value through earnings in the financial statement line item to which the derivative relates. As a result, during the three- and six-month periods ended March 30, 2019 , respectively, the Company recognized a loss of $ 30 million and a gain of $ 225 million in net sales, a loss of $ 107 million and a gain of $ 68 million in cost of sales and losses of $ 77 million and $ 24 million in other income/(expense), net. During the three- and six-month periods ended March 31, 2018 , respectively, the Company recognized losses of $ 203 million and $ 142 million in net sales, losses of $ 247 million and $ 212 million in cost of sales and losses of $ 331 million and $ 373 million in other income/(expense), net. Apple Inc. | Q2 2019 Form 10-Q | 12 The Company records all derivatives in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The Company’s accounting treatment for these derivative instruments is based on its hedge designation. The following tables show the Company’s derivative instruments at gross fair value as of March 30, 2019 and September 29, 2018 (in millions): March 30, 2019 Fair Value of Derivatives Designated as Hedge Instruments Fair Value of Derivatives Not Designated as Hedge Instruments Total Fair Value Derivative assets (1) : Foreign exchange contracts $ 1,364 $ 216 $ 1,580 Interest rate contracts $ 68 $ — $ 68 Derivative liabilities (2) : Foreign exchange contracts $ 649 $ 273 $ 922 Interest rate contracts $ 402 $ — $ 402 September 29, 2018 Fair Value of Derivatives Designated as Hedge Instruments Fair Value of Derivatives Not Designated as Hedge Instruments Total Fair Value Derivative assets (1) : Foreign exchange contracts $ 1,015 $ 259 $ 1,274 Derivative liabilities (2) : Foreign exchange contracts $ 543 $ 137 $ 680 Interest rate contracts $ 1,456 $ — $ 1,456 (1) The fair value of derivative assets is measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and is recorded as other current assets and other non-current assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. (2) The fair value of derivative liabilities is measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and is recorded as other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company classifies cash flows related to derivative financial instruments as operating activities in its Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Apple Inc. | Q2 2019 Form 10-Q | 13 The following table shows the pre-tax gains and losses of the Company’s derivative and non-derivative instruments designated as cash flow, net investment and fair value hedges in OCI and the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three- and six-month periods ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018 (in millions): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended March 30, 2019 March 31, 2018 March 30, 2019 March 31, 2018 Gains/(Losses) recognized in OCI – effective portion: Cash flow hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ ( 64 ) $ 37 $ ( 542 ) $ 190 Interest rate contracts — — — 1 Total $ ( 64 ) $ 37 $ ( 542 ) $ 191 Net investment hedges: Foreign currency debt $ ( 7 ) $ ( 33 ) $ ( 23 ) $ ( 31 ) Gains/(Losses) reclassified from AOCI into net income – effective portion: Cash flow hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ 134 $ 287 $ 16 $ 163 Interest rate contracts ( 2 ) 2 ( 3 ) 3 Total $ 132 $ 289 $ 13 $ 166 Gains/(Losses) on derivative instruments: Fair value hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ 243 $ — $ 645 $ — Interest rate contracts 465 ( 674 ) 1,122 ( 948 ) Total $ 708 $ ( 674 ) $ 1,767 $ ( 948 ) Gains/(Losses) related to hedged items: Fair value hedges: Marketable securities $ ( 242 ) $ — $ ( 644 ) $ — Fixed-rate debt ( 465 ) 674 ( 1,122 ) 948 Total $ ( 707 ) $ 674 $ ( 1,766 ) $ 948 The following table shows the notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments and credit risk amounts associated with outstanding or unsettled derivative instruments as of March 30, 2019 and September 29, 2018 (in millions): March 30, 2019 September 29, 2018 Notional Amount Credit Risk Amount Notional Amount Credit Risk Amount Instruments designated as accounting hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ 52,660 $ 1,364 $ 65,368 $ 1,015 Interest rate contracts $ 33,250 $ 68 $ 33,250 $ — Instruments not designated as accounting hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ 63,477 $ 216 $ 63,062 $ 259 Apple Inc. | Q2 2019 Form 10-Q | 14 The notional amounts for outstanding derivative instruments provide one measure of the transaction volume outstanding and do not represent the amount of the Company’s exposure to credit or market loss. The credit risk amounts represent the Company’s gross exposure to potential accounting loss on derivative instruments that are outstanding or unsettled if all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current currency or interest rates at each respective date. The Company’s exposure to credit loss and market risk will vary over time as currency and interest rates change. Although the table above reflects the notional and credit risk amounts of the Company’s derivative instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses associated with the exposures and transactions that the instruments are intended to hedge. The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments. The Company generally enters into master netting arrangements, which are designed to reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. The Company presents its derivative assets and derivative liabilities at their gross fair values in its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of March 30, 2019 , the net cash collateral received by the Company related to derivative instruments under its collateral security arrangements was $ 505 million , which was recorded as other current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of September 29, 2018 , the net cash collateral posted by the Company related to derivative instruments under its collateral security arrangements was $ 1.0 billion , which was recorded as other current assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. Under master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to the Company’s derivative contracts, the Company is allowed to net settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of March 30, 2019 and September 29, 2018 , the potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the Company’s derivative contracts, including the effects of collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $ 1.7 billion and $ 2.1 billion , respectively, resulting in a net derivative liability of $ 181 million and a net derivative asset of $ 138 million , respectively. Accounts Receivable Trade Receivables The Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, resellers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral or third-party credit support in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements. As of March 30, 2019 , the Company had no customers that individually represented 10% or more of total trade receivables. As of September 29, 2018 , the Company had one customer that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, which accounted for 10 % . The Company’s cellular network carriers accounted for 45 % and 59 % of total trade receivables as of March 30, 2019 and September 29, 2018 , respectively. Vendor Non-Trade Receivables The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. As of March 30, 2019 , the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 56 % and 16 % . As of September 29, 2018 , the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 62 % and 12 % . Apple Inc. | Q2 2019 Form 10-Q | 15 Note 4 – Condensed Consolidated Financial Statement Details The following tables show the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statement details as of March 30, 2019 and September 29, 2018 (in millions): Property, Plant and Equipment, Net March 30, 2019 September 29, 2018 Land and buildings $ 16,308 $ 16,216 Machinery, equipment and internal-use software 68,139 65,982 Leasehold improvements 8,589 8,205 Gross property, plant and equipment 93,036 90,403 Accumulated depreciation and amortization ( 54,290 ) ( 49,099 ) Total property, plant and equipment, net $ 38,746 $ 41,304 Other Non-Current Liabilities March 30, 2019 September 29, 2018 Long-term taxes payable $ 30,986 $ 33,589 Other non-current liabilities 21,179 15,325 Total other non-current liabilities $ 52,165 $ 48,914 Other Income/(Expense), Net The following table shows the detail of other income/(expense), net for the three- and six-month periods ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018 (in millions): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended March 30, 2019 March 31, 2018 March 30, 2019 March 31, 2018 Interest and dividend income $ 1,358 $ 1,505 $ 2,665 $ 2,957 Interest expense ( 1,010 ) ( 792 ) ( 1,900 ) ( 1,526 ) Other income/(expense), net 30 ( 439 ) 173 ( 401 ) Total other income/(expense), net $ 378 $ 274 $ 938 $ 1,030 Note 5 – Income Taxes Uncertain Tax Positions As of March 30, 2019 , the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $ 14.9 billion , of which $ 7.3 billion , if recognized, would impact the Company’s effective tax rate. The Company had accrued $ 1.3 billion of gross interest and penalties as of March 30, 2019 . Both the unrecognized tax benefits and the associated interest and penalties that are not expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one year are classified as other non-current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service concluded its review of the years 2013 through 2015 in 2018, and all years prior to 2016 are closed. Tax years subsequent to 2006 in certain major U.S. states and subsequent to 2010 in certain major foreign jurisdictions remain open, and could be subject to examination by the taxing authorities. The Company believes that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Company’s tax audits are resolved in a manner inconsistent with its expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs. Although timing of resolution and/or closure of audits is not certain, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that its gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease (either by payment, release or a combination of both) in the next 12 months by as much as $ 300 million . Apple Inc. | Q2 2019 Form 10-Q | 16 European Commission State Aid Decision On August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company (the “State Aid Decision”). The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. The recovery amount was calculated to be € 13.1 billion , plus interest of € 1.2 billion . Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The Company believes the State Aid Decision to be without merit and appealed to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union. Ireland has also appealed the State Aid Decision. The Company believes that any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision would be creditable against U.S. taxes, subject to any foreign tax credit limitations in the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. As of March 30, 2019 , the entire recovery amount plus interest was funded into escrow, where it will remain restricted from general use pending conclusion of all appeals. Refer to Note 3, “Financial Instruments” for more information. Note 6 – Debt Commercial Paper The Company issues unsecured short-term promissory notes (“Commercial Paper”) pursuant to a commercial paper program. The Company uses net proceeds from the commercial paper program for general corporate purposes, including dividends and share repurchases. As of March 30, 2019 and September 29, 2018 , the Company had $ 11.9 billion and $ 12.0 billion of Commercial Paper outstanding, respectively, with maturities generally less than nine months . The weighted-average interest rate of the Company’s Commercial Paper was 2.56 % as of March 30, 2019 and 2.18 % as of September 29, 2018 . The following table provides a summary of cash flows associated with the issuance and maturities of Commercial Paper for the six months ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018 (in millions): Six Months Ended March 30, 2019 March 31, 2018 Maturities 90 days or less: Proceeds from/(Repayments of) commercial paper, net $ ( 2,484 ) $ 4,070 Maturities greater than 90 days: Proceeds from commercial paper 10,235 5,550 Repayments of commercial paper ( 7,787 ) ( 9,619 ) Proceeds from/(Repayments of) commercial paper, net 2,448 ( 4,069 ) Total proceeds from/(repayments of) commercial paper, net $ ( 36 ) $ 1 Term Debt As of March 30, 2019 , the Company had outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $ 101.2 billion (collectively the “Notes”). The Notes are senior unsecured obligations, and interest is payable in arrears, quarterly for the U.S. dollar–denominated and Australian dollar–denominated floating-rate notes, semi-annually for the U.S. dollar–denominated, Australian dollar–denominated, British pound–denominated, Japanese yen–denominated and Canadian dollar–denominated fixed-rate notes and annually for the euro-denominated and Swiss franc–denominated fixed-rate notes.

Additionally, to manage foreign currency risk on certain of its foreign currency–denominated notes, the Company has entered into foreign currency swaps to effectively convert these notes to U.S. dollar–denominated notes. A portion of the Company’s Japanese yen–denominated notes is designated as a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of the Company’s net investment in a foreign operation. As of March 30, 2019 and September 29, 2018 , the carrying value of the debt designated as a net investment hedge was $ 1.1 billion and $ 811 million , respectively. For further discussion regarding the Company’s use of derivative instruments, refer to the Derivative Financial Instruments section of Note 3, “Financial Instruments.” The effective interest rates for the Notes include the interest on the Notes, amortization of the discount or premium and, if applicable, adjustments related to hedging. The Company recognized $ 828 million and $ 1.6 billion of interest expense on its term debt for the three- and six-month periods ended March 30, 2019 , respectively. The Company recognized $ 742 million and $ 1.4 billion of interest expense on its term debt for the three- and six-month periods ended March 31, 2018 , respectively.

On April 30, 2019 , the Company announced the Board of Directors increased the share repurchase program authorization from $ 100 billion to $ 175 billion . The Company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. Under this program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Note 8 – Comprehensive Income The Company’s OCI consists of foreign currency translation adjustments from those subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, net deferred gains and losses on certain derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges and unrealized gains and losses on marketable debt securities classified as available-for-sale.

Apple Inc. | Q2 2019 Form 10-Q | 19 Note 9 – Benefit Plans Stock Plans The Company had 235.5 million shares reserved for future issuance under its stock plans as of March 30, 2019 . Restricted stock units (“RSUs”) granted under the Company’s stock plans generally vest over four years , based on continued employment, and are settled upon vesting in shares of the Company’s common stock on a one -for-one basis. Each share issued with respect to RSUs granted under the Company’s stock plans reduces the number of shares available for grant under the plans by two shares. RSUs canceled and shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations increase the number of shares available for grant under the plans utilizing a factor of two times the number of RSUs canceled or shares withheld. Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans During the three months ended March 30, 2019 , Section 16 officers Angela Ahrendts, Timothy D. Cook, Chris Kondo, Luca Maestri and Jeffrey Williams had equity trading plans in place in accordance with Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) under the Exchange Act. An equity trading plan is a written document that pre-establishes the amounts, prices and dates (or formula for determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of the Company’s stock, including shares acquired pursuant to the Company’s employee and director equity plans. Restricted Stock Units A summary of the Company’s RSU activity and related information for the six months ended March 30, 2019 is as follows: Number of RSUs (in thousands) Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value Per RSU Aggregate Fair Value (in millions) Balance as of September 29, 2018 92,155 $ 134.60 RSUs granted 32,252 $ 218.06 RSUs vested ( 20,988 ) $ 125.84 RSUs canceled ( 2,302 ) $ 157.83 Balance as of March 30, 2019 101,117 $ 162.51 $ 19,207 The fair value as of the respective vesting dates of RSUs was $ 348 million and $ 4.4 billion for the three- and six-month periods ended March 30, 2019 , respectively, and was $ 457 million and $ 3.6 billion for the three- and six-month periods ended March 31, 2018 , respectively. Share-Based Compensation The following table shows share-based compensation expense and the related income tax benefit included in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three- and six-month periods ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018 (in millions): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended March 30, 2019 March 31, 2018 March 30, 2019 March 31, 2018 Share-based compensation expense $ 1,514 $ 1,348 $ 3,073 $ 2,644 Income tax benefit related to share-based compensation expense $ ( 331 ) $ ( 347 ) $ ( 1,081 ) $ ( 978 ) As of March 30, 2019 , the total unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding RSUs and stock options was $ 12.8 billion , which the Company expects to recognize over a weighted-average period of 2.8 years . Apple Inc. | Q2 2019 Form 10-Q | 20 Note 10 – Commitments and Contingencies Accrued Warranty and Indemnification The following table shows changes in the Company’s accrued warranties and related costs for the three- and six-month periods ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018 (in millions): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended March 30, 2019 March 31, 2018 March 30, 2019 March 31, 2018 Beginning accrued warranty and related costs $ 3,819 $ 4,323 $ 3,692 $ 3,834 Cost of warranty claims ( 915 ) ( 933 ) ( 1,911 ) ( 1,915 ) Accruals for product warranty 583 640 1,706 2,111 Ending accrued warranty and related costs $ 3,487 $ 4,030 $ 3,487 $ 4,030 Agreements entered into by the Company may include indemnification provisions, which may subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. Except as disclosed under the heading “Contingencies” below, in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to indemnification of third parties. The Company offers an iPhone Upgrade Program, which is available to customers who purchase a qualifying iPhone in the U.S., the U.K. and mainland China. The iPhone Upgrade Program provides customers the right to trade in that iPhone for a specified amount when purchasing a new iPhone, provided certain conditions are met. The Company accounts for the trade-in right as a guarantee liability and recognizes arrangement revenue net of the fair value of such right, with subsequent changes to the guarantee liability recognized within net sales. The Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers. Under these agreements, the Company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers of the Company, and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim. While the Company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise. Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product Although most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. In addition, the Company competes for various components with other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices and personal computers. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that could materially adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and operating results. The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. If the Company’s supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company’s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. The Company’s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements. The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results. Apple Inc. | Q2 2019 Form 10-Q | 21 Substantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia, with some Mac computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland. A significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Certain of these outsourcing partners are single-sourced suppliers of components and manufacturers for many of the Company’s products. Although the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the Company’s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production commitments. The Company’s manufacturing purchase obligations typically cover its requirements for periods up to 150 days . Other Off–Balance Sheet Commitments Operating Leases The Company leases various equipment and facilities, including retail space, under noncancelable operating lease arrangements. The Company does not currently utilize any other off–balance sheet financing arrangements. As of March 30, 2019 , the Company’s total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases were $ 10.4 billion . The Company’s retail store and other facility leases typically have original terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multi-year renewal options. Unconditional Purchase Obligations The Company has entered into certain off–balance sheet commitments that require the future purchase of goods or services (“unconditional purchase obligations”). The Company’s unconditional purchase obligations primarily consist of payments for supplier arrangements, internet and telecommunication services, intellectual property licenses and content creation. As of March 30, 2019 , the Company’s total future payments under noncancelable unconditional purchase obligations having a remaining term in excess of one year were $ 7.6 billion . Contingencies The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully adjudicated, as further discussed in Part II, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q under the heading “Legal Proceedings” and in Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q under the heading “Risk Factors.” The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims, except for the following matters: VirnetX VirnetX, Inc. filed two lawsuits in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas (the “Eastern Texas District Court”) against the Company alleging that certain Company products infringe four patents (the “VirnetX Patents”) relating to network communications technology (“VirnetX I” and “VirnetX II”). On September 30, 2016, a jury returned a verdict in VirnetX I against the Company and awarded damages of $ 302 million , which later increased to $ 440 million in post-trial proceedings. The Company appealed the VirnetX I verdict to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (the “Federal Circuit”). On April 11, 2018, a jury returned a verdict in VirnetX II against the Company and awarded damages of $ 503 million . VirnetX II is currently on appeal. The Company has challenged the validity of the VirnetX Patents at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the “PTO”). In response, the PTO has declared the VirnetX Patents invalid. VirnetX appealed the invalidity decision of the PTO to the Federal Circuit. The Federal Circuit consolidated the Company’s appeal of the Eastern Texas District Court VirnetX I verdict and VirnetX’s appeals from the PTO invalidity proceedings. On January 15, 2019, the Federal Circuit affirmed the VirnetX I verdict, which the Company intends to further appeal. The remaining appeals from the PTO proceedings invalidating the VirnetX Patents remain pending. The Company has accrued its best estimate for the ultimate resolution of these matters. Qualcomm On January 20, 2017, the Company filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm Incorporated and affiliated parties (“Qualcomm”) in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California seeking, among other things, to enjoin Qualcomm from requiring the Company to pay royalties at the rate demanded by Qualcomm. No Qualcomm-related royalty payments had been remitted by the Company to its contract manufacturers since the beginning of the second quarter of 2017. Following the Company’s lawsuit, Qualcomm filed patent infringement suits against the Company and its affiliates in the U.S. and various international jurisdictions, some of which sought to enjoin the sale of certain of the Company’s products in particular countries. On April 16, 2019, the Company and Qualcomm reached a settlement agreement to dismiss all litigation between the two companies worldwide. The companies also reached a multi-year license agreement and a multi-year supply agreement. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, Apple will make a payment to Qualcomm to, among other things, resolve disputes over the withheld royalty payments. Apple Inc. | Q2 2019 Form 10-Q | 22 iOS Performance Management Cases Various civil litigation matters have been filed in state and federal courts in the U.S. and in various international jurisdictions alleging violation of consumer protection laws, fraud, computer intrusion and other causes of action related to the Company’s performance management feature used in its iPhone operating systems, introduced to certain iPhones in iOS updates 10.2.1 and 11.2. The claims seek monetary damages and other non-monetary relief. On April 5, 2018, several U.S. federal actions were consolidated through a Multidistrict Litigation process into a single action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. In addition to civil litigation, the Company is also responding to governmental investigations and requests for information relating to the performance management feature. The Company believes that its iPhones were not defective, that the performance management feature introduced with iOS updates 10.2.1 and 11.2 was intended to, and did, improve customers’ user experience, and that the Company did not make any misleading statements or fail to disclose any material information. The Company has accrued its best estimate for the ultimate resolution of these matters. Note 11 – Segment Information and Geographic Data The Company reports segment information based on the “management” approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company’s reportable segments. The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described in Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of the 2018 Form 10-K. The Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company’s retail stores located in those geographic locations. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the reportable segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as research and development, corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges and other separately managed general and administrative costs. The Company does not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes. Apple Inc. | Q2 2019 Form 10-Q | 23 The following table shows information by reportable segment for the three- and six-month periods ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018 (in millions): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended March 30, 2019 March 31, 2018 March 30, 2019 March 31, 2018 Americas: Net sales $ 25,596 $ 24,841 $ 62,536 $ 60,034 Operating income $ 7,687 $ 7,768 $ 18,887 $ 19,084 Europe: Net sales $ 13,054 $ 13,846 $ 33,417 $ 34,900 Operating income $ 4,026 $ 4,259 $ 10,684 $ 11,152 Greater China: Net sales $ 10,218 $ 13,024 $ 23,387 $ 30,980 Operating income $ 3,607 $ 4,963 $ 8,921 $ 11,871 Japan: Net sales $ 5,532 $ 5,468 $ 12,442 $ 12,705 Operating income $ 2,390 $ 2,346 $ 5,404 $ 5,428 Rest of Asia Pacific: Net sales $ 3,615 $ 3,958 $ 10,543 $ 10,811 Operating income $ 1,096 $ 1,278 $ 3,656 $ 3,853 A reconciliation of the Company’s segment operating income to the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three- and six-month periods ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018 is as follows (in millions): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended March 30, 2019 March 31, 2018 March 30, 2019 March 31, 2018 Segment operating income $ 18,806 $ 20,614 $ 47,552 $ 51,388 Research and development expense ( 3,948 ) ( 3,378 ) ( 7,850 ) ( 6,785 ) Other corporate expenses, net ( 1,443 ) ( 1,342 ) ( 2,941 ) ( 2,435 ) Total operating income $ 13,415 $ 15,894 $ 36,761 $ 42,168 Apple Inc. | Q2 2019 Form 10-Q | 24 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This section and other parts of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“Form 10-Q”) contain forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. Forward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as “future,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “predicts,” “will,” “would,” “could,” “can,” “may,” and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company’s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q under the heading “Risk Factors,” which are incorporated herein by reference. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 29, 2018 (the “ 2018 Form 10-K”) filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. All information presented herein is based on the Company’s fiscal calendar. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months or periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Each of the terms the “Company” and “Apple” as used herein refers collectively to Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, unless otherwise stated. The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law. Available Information The Company’s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to reports filed pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), are filed with the SEC. The Company is subject to the informational requirements of the Exchange Act and files or furnishes reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC.

The SEC maintains an internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC at www.sec.gov. The Company periodically provides other information for investors on its corporate website, www.apple.com, and its investor relations website, investor.apple.com. This includes press releases and other information about financial performance, information on corporate governance and details related to the Company’s annual meeting of shareholders. The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form 10-Q is not incorporated by reference into this filing. Further, the Company’s references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only. Quarterly Highlights Business Seasonality and Product Introductions The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction. However, neither historical seasonal patterns nor historical patterns of product or service introductions should be considered reliable indicators of the Company’s future pattern of product or service introductions, future net sales or financial performance. Second Quarter Fiscal 2019 Highlights Total net sales decreased 5% or $3.1 billion during the second quarter of 2019 compared to the same quarter in 2018, driven by lower iPhone net sales, partially offset by higher Services and Wearables, Home and Accessories net sales. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable impact on net sales during the second quarter of 2019. During the second quarter of 2019, the Company released the following products: • An iPad Air ® and an updated iPad mini ® , featuring Retina ® displays and Apple Pencil ® compatibility. • An updated iMac ® with improved compute and graphics performance. • Updated AirPods with hands-free “Hey Siri” and the option of a wireless charging case. Apple Inc. | Q2 2019 Form 10-Q | 25 The Company also announced the following new services: • Apple News+, a subscription news and magazine service, available initially in the U.S. and Canada. • Apple Card™, a new kind of credit card designed for the iPhone, expected to be available to qualified customers in the U.S. in summer 2019. • Apple Arcade™, a game subscription service, expected to launch in fall 2019. • New Apple TV app and Apple TV channels, bringing together different ways to access shows, movies, sports and news in one app across devices, and allowing users to subscribe to specific third-party video services, expected to be available starting in May 2019. • Apple TV+, a new subscription service for exclusive original shows, movies and documentaries, expected to be available in fall 2019. The Company repurchased $24.0 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $3.4 billion during the second quarter of 2019 . Products and Services Performance Beginning in the first quarter of 2019, the Company classified the amortization of the deferred value of Maps, Siri and free iCloud services, which are bundled in the sales price of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products, in services net sales. Historically, the Company classified the amortization of these amounts in products net sales consistent with its management reporting framework. As a result, products and services net sales information for the second quarter and first six months of 2018 was reclassified to conform to the 2019 presentation. The following table shows net sales by category for the three- and six-month periods ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018 (dollars in millions): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended March 30, 2019 March 31, 2018 Change March 30, 2019 March 31, 2018 Change Net sales by category: iPhone (1) $ 31,051 $ 37,559 (17 )% $ 83,033 $ 98,663 (16 )% Mac (1) 5,513 5,776 (5 )% 12,929 12,600 3 % iPad (1) 4,872 4,008 22 % 11,601 9,763 19 % Wearables, Home and Accessories (1)(2) 5,129 3,944 30 % 12,437 9,425 32 % Services (3) 11,450 9,850 16 % 22,325 18,979 18 % Total net sales $ 58,015 $ 61,137 (5 )% $ 142,325 $ 149,430 (5 )% (1) Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are bundled in the sales price of the respective product. (2) Wearables, Home and Accessories net sales include sales of AirPods, Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats products, HomePod, iPod touch and Apple-branded and third-party accessories. (3) Services net sales include sales from the Company’s digital content stores and streaming services, AppleCare, Apple Pay, licensing and other services. Services net sales also include amortization of the deferred value of Maps, Siri and free iCloud services, which are bundled in the sales price of certain products. iPhone iPhone net sales decreased during the second quarter and first six months of 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018 due primarily to lower iPhone unit sales in all the reportable geographic segments. Mac Mac net sales decreased during the second quarter of 2019 compared to the same quarter in 2018 due primarily to lower net sales of iMac. Year-over-year Mac net sales increased during the first six months of 2019 due primarily to higher net sales of MacBook Air, partially offset by lower net sales of iMac. iPad iPad net sales increased during the second quarter and first six months of 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018 due primarily to higher net sales of iPad Pro ® . Apple Inc. | Q2 2019 Form 10-Q | 26 Wearables, Home and Accessories Wearables, Home and Accessories net sales increased during the second quarter and first six months of 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018 due primarily to higher net sales of Apple Watch and AirPods. Services Services net sales increased during the second quarter and first six months of 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018 due primarily to the App Store, licensing and AppleCare. Segment Operating Performance The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. Further information regarding the Company’s reportable segments can be found in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 11, “Segment Information and Geographic Data.” The following table shows net sales by reportable segment for the three- and six-month periods ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018 (dollars in millions): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended March 30, 2019 March 31, 2018 Change March 30, 2019 March 31, 2018 Change Net sales by reportable segment: Americas $ 25,596 $ 24,841 3 % $ 62,536 $ 60,034 4 % Europe 13,054 13,846 (6 )% 33,417 34,900 (4 )% Greater China 10,218 13,024 (22 )% 23,387 30,980 (25 )% Japan 5,532 5,468 1 % 12,442 12,705 (2 )% Rest of Asia Pacific 3,615 3,958 (9 )% 10,543 10,811 (2 )% Total net sales $ 58,015 $ 61,137 (5 )% $ 142,325 $ 149,430 (5 )% Americas Americas net sales increased during the second quarter and first six months of 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018 due primarily to higher Services and Wearables, Home and Accessories net sales, partially offset by lower iPhone net sales. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable impact on Americas net sales during the second quarter and first six months of 2019. Europe Europe net sales decreased during the second quarter and first six months of 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018 due primarily to lower iPhone net sales, partially offset by higher Wearables, Home and Accessories and Services net sales. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable impact on Europe net sales during the second quarter and first six months of 2019. Greater China Greater China net sales decreased during the second quarter and first six months of 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018, driven by lower iPhone net sales. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable impact on Greater China net sales during the second quarter and first six months of 2019. Japan Japan net sales during the second quarter of 2019 were relatively flat compared to the same quarter in 2018, as higher Services and iPad net sales were primarily offset by lower iPhone net sales. Year-over-year Japan net sales decreased during the first six months of 2019 due primarily to lower iPhone net sales, partially offset by higher Services and iPad net sales. The value of the Japanese Yen relative to the U.S. dollar had a favorable impact on Japan net sales during the second quarter of 2019. Apple Inc. | Q2 2019 Form 10-Q | 27 Rest of Asia Pacific Rest of Asia Pacific net sales decreased during the second quarter and first six months of 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018 due primarily to lower iPhone net sales, partially offset by higher Wearables, Home and Accessories and iPad net sales. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable impact on Rest of Asia Pacific net sales during the second quarter and first six months of 2019. Gross Margin Products and services gross margin and gross margin percentage for the three- and six-month periods ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018 were as follows (dollars in millions): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended March 30, 2019 March 31, 2018 March 30, 2019 March 31, 2018 Gross margin: Products $ 14,518 $ 17,351 $ 39,715 $ 45,940 Services 7,303 6,071 14,137 11,394 Total gross margin $ 21,821 $ 23,422 $ 53,852 $ 57,334 Gross margin percentage: Products 31.2 % 33.8 % 33.1 % 35.2 % Services 63.8 % 61.6 % 63.3 % 60.0 % Total gross margin percentage 37.6 % 38.3 % 37.8 % 38.4 % Products Gross Margin Products gross margin decreased during the second quarter and first six months of 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018 due primarily to lower iPhone unit sales and the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Year-over-year products gross margin percentage decreased during the second quarter and first six months of 2019 due primarily to the impact of lower iPhone unit sales on the Company’s products fixed cost structure and the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Services Gross Margin Services gross margin increased during the second quarter and first six months of 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018 due primarily to a different services mix. Year-over-year services gross margin percentage increased during the second quarter and first six months of 2019 due primarily to a different services mix and leverage of the Company’s services fixed cost structure from higher services net sales, partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. The Company anticipates total gross margin percentage during the third quarter of 2019 to be between 37.0% and 38.0%. The foregoing statement regarding the Company’s expected total gross margin percentage in the third quarter of 2019 is forward-looking and could differ from actual results. The Company’s future gross margins can be impacted by multiple factors including, but not limited to, those set forth in Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q under the heading “Risk Factors” and those described in this paragraph. In general, the Company believes gross margins will be subject to volatility and remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in response to such pressures; increased competition; the Company’s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and acquiring and delivering content for the Company’s services; the Company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix; fluctuations in exchange rates; and costs associated with the Company’s frequent introductions and transitions of products and services. Apple Inc. | Q2 2019 Form 10-Q | 28 Operating Expenses Operating expenses for the three- and six-month periods ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018 were as follows (dollars in millions): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended March 30, 2019 March 31, 2018 March 30, 2019 March 31, 2018 Research and development $ 3,948 $ 3,378 $ 7,850 $ 6,785 Percentage of total net sales 7 % 6 % 6 % 5 % Selling, general and administrative $ 4,458 $ 4,150 $ 9,241 $ 8,381 Percentage of total net sales 8 % 7 % 6 % 6 % Total operating expenses $ 8,406 $ 7,528 $ 17,091 $ 15,166 Percentage of total net sales 14 % 12 % 12 % 10 % Research and Development The growth in research and development (“R&D”) expense during the second quarter and first six months of 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses and infrastructure-related costs. The Company continues to believe that focused investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace, and to the development of new and updated products and services that are central to the Company’s core business strategy. Selling, General and Administrative The growth in selling, general and administrative expense during the second quarter of 2019 compared to the same quarter in 2018 was driven primarily by higher spending on marketing and advertising and increases in headcount-related expenses. The year-over-year growth in selling, general and administrative expense during the first six months of 2019 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses, marketing and advertising spending and infrastructure-related costs. Other Income/(Expense), Net Other income/(expense), net for the three- and six-month periods ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018 was as follows (dollars in millions): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended March 30, 2019 March 31, 2018 Change March 30, 2019 March 31, 2018 Change Interest and dividend income $ 1,358 $ 1,505 $ 2,665 $ 2,957 Interest expense (1,010 ) (792 ) (1,900 ) (1,526 ) Other income/(expense), net 30 (439 ) 173 (401 ) Total other income/(expense), net $ 378 $ 274 38 % $ 938 $ 1,030 (9 )% The increase in other income/(expense), net during the second quarter of 2019 compared to the same quarter in 2018 was due primarily to the impact of foreign exchange–related items, partially offset by higher interest expense and lower interest income. The year-over-year decrease in other income/(expense), net during the first six months of 2019 was due primarily to higher interest expense, lower interest income and lower investment-related gains, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange–related items. The weighted-average interest rate earned by the Company on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was 2.27% and 2.14% in the second quarter of 2019 and 2018 , respectively, and 2.23% and 2.12% in the first six months of 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Apple Inc. | Q2 2019 Form 10-Q | 29 Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for the three- and six-month periods ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018 were as follows (dollars in millions): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended March 30, 2019 March 31, 2018 March 30, 2019 March 31, 2018 Provision for income taxes $ 2,232 $ 2,346 $ 6,173 $ 9,311 Effective tax rate 16.2 % 14.5 % 16.4 % 21.6 % Statutory federal income tax rate 21 % 24.5 % 21 % 24.5 % The Company’s effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2019 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to the lower tax rate on foreign earnings. The Company’s effective tax rate for the first six months of 2019 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to the lower tax rate on foreign earnings and tax benefits from share-based compensation. The Company’s effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2019 was higher compared to the same quarter in 2018 due primarily to higher taxes on foreign earnings, partially offset by a lower statutory federal income tax rate in 2019. The Company’s effective tax rate for the first six months of 2019 was lower compared to the same period in 2018 due primarily to higher taxes in 2018 arising from the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”) and a lower statutory federal income tax rate in 2019, partially offset by higher taxes on foreign earnings in 2019. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Hedging In August 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities (“ASU 2017-12”). ASU 2017-12 expands component and fair value hedging, specifies the presentation of the effects of hedging instruments, and eliminates the separate measurement and presentation of hedge ineffectiveness. The Company will adopt ASU 2017-12 in its first quarter of 2020 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. Based on the Company’s derivative portfolio and hedging strategies, the adoption of ASU 2017-12 is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. Financial Instruments In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“ASU 2016-13”), which modifies the measurement of expected credit losses on certain financial instruments. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-13 in its first quarter of 2021 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. Based on the composition of the Company’s investment portfolio, current market conditions, and historical credit loss activity, the adoption of ASU 2016-13 is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. Leases In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (“ASU 2016-02”), which modifies lease accounting for lessees to increase transparency and comparability by recording lease assets and liabilities for operating leases and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-02 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method through a cumulative-effect adjustment at the beginning of its first quarter of 2020. While the Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2016-02, based on the lease portfolio as of March 30, 2019 , the Company anticipates recording lease assets and liabilities of approximately $9 billion on its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, with no material impact to its Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. However, the ultimate impact of adopting ASU 2016-02 will depend on the Company’s lease portfolio as of the adoption date. Apple Inc. | Q2 2019 Form 10-Q | 30 Liquidity and Capital Resources The following tables present selected financial information and statistics as of March 30, 2019 and September 29, 2018 and for the first six months of 2019 and 2018 (in millions): March 30, 2019 September 29, 2018 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities (1) $ 225,411 $ 237,100 Property, plant and equipment, net $ 38,746 $ 41,304 Commercial paper $ 11,924 $ 11,964 Total term debt $ 100,706 $ 102,519 Working capital $ 29,574 $ 15,410 Six Months Ended March 30, 2019 March 31, 2018 Cash generated by operating activities $ 37,845 $ 43,423 Cash generated by investing activities $ 19,192 $ 15,120 Cash used in financing activities $ (43,133 ) $ (33,773 ) (1) As of March 30, 2019 and September 29, 2018 , total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities included $19.3 billion and $20.3 billion , respectively, that was restricted from general use, related to the State Aid Decision (refer to Note 5, “Income Taxes” in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q) and other agreements. The Company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, along with commercial paper and other short-term liquidity arrangements, will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital asset purchases, dividends, share repurchases, debt repayments and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months. In connection with the State Aid Decision, as of March 30, 2019 , the entire recovery amount of €13.1 billion plus interest of €1.2 billion was funded into escrow, where it will remain restricted from general use pending conclusion of all appeals. The Company’s marketable securities investment portfolio is primarily invested in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company’s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. During the six months ended March 30, 2019 , cash generated by operating activities of $37.8 billion was a result of $31.5 billion of net income and non-cash adjustments to net income of $9.2 billion , partially offset by a decrease in the net change in operating assets and liabilities of $2.9 billion . Cash generated by investing activities of $19.2 billion during the six months ended March 30, 2019 consisted primarily of proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities, net of purchases, of $25.7 billion , partially offset by cash used to acquire property, plant and equipment of $5.7 billion . Cash used in financing activities of $43.1 billion during the six months ended March 30, 2019 consisted primarily of cash used to repurchase common stock of $32.5 billion , cash used to pay dividends and dividend equivalents of $7.0 billion and cash used to repay term debt of $2.5 billion . During the six months ended March 31, 2018 , cash generated by operating activities of $43.4 billion was a result of $33.9 billion of net income and an increase in the net change in operating assets and liabilities of $35.8 billion , partially offset by non-cash adjustments to net income of $26.3 billion . Cash generated by investing activities of $15.1 billion during the six months ended March 31, 2018 consisted primarily of proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities, net of purchases, of $22.4 billion , partially offset by cash used to acquire property, plant and equipment of $7.0 billion . Cash used in financing activities of $33.8 billion during the six months ended March 31, 2018 consisted primarily of cash used to repurchase common stock of $32.9 billion and cash used to pay dividends and dividend equivalents of $6.5 billion , partially offset by net proceeds from the issuance of term debt of $7.0 billion . Capital Assets The Company’s capital expenditures were $3.3 billion during the first six months of 2019 . The Company anticipates utilizing approximately $12.0 billion for capital expenditures during 2019 , which includes product tooling and manufacturing process equipment; data centers; corporate facilities and infrastructure, including information systems hardware, software and enhancements; and retail store facilities. Apple Inc. | Q2 2019 Form 10-Q | 31 Debt The Company issues unsecured short-term promissory notes (“Commercial Paper”) pursuant to a commercial paper program. The Company uses the net proceeds from the commercial paper program for general corporate purposes, including dividends and share repurchases. As of March 30, 2019 , the Company had $11.9 billion of Commercial Paper outstanding, with a weighted-average interest rate of 2.56% and maturities generally less than nine months . As of March 30, 2019 , the Company had outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $101.2 billion (collectively the “Notes”). During the first six months of 2019, the Company repaid $2.5 billion of its Notes upon maturity. The Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on the Notes. In addition, the Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into foreign currency swaps to manage foreign currency risk on the Notes. Further information regarding the Company’s debt issuances and related hedging activity can be found in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 3, “Financial Instruments” and Note 6, “Debt.” Capital Return Program As of March 30, 2019 , the Company had an authorized program to repurchase up to $100 billion of the Company’s common stock, of which $61.3 billion had been utilized. During the six months ended March 30, 2019 , the Company repurchased 164.7 million shares of its common stock for $32.2 billion , including 55.1 million shares initially delivered under a $12.0 billion accelerated share repurchase arrangement (“ASR”) dated February 2019. On April 30, 2019 , the Company announced the Board of Directors increased the share repurchase program authorization from $100 billion to $175 billion . The Company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. Under this program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act. On April 30, 2019 , the Company also announced the Board of Directors raised the Company’s quarterly cash dividend from $0.73 to $0.77 per share, beginning with the dividend to be paid during the third quarter of 2019. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. Contractual Obligations Operating Leases As of March 30, 2019 , the Company’s total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases were $10.4 billion . The Company’s retail store and other facility leases typically have original terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multi-year renewal options. Manufacturing Purchase Obligations The Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture sub-assemblies for the Company’s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. These outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days . The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. As of March 30, 2019 , the Company expects to pay $26.2 billion under manufacturing-related supplier arrangements, which are primarily noncancelable. Other Purchase Obligations The Company’s other purchase obligations consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and noncancelable obligations related to advertising, licensing, R&D, internet and telecommunications services, content creation and other activities. As of March 30, 2019 , the Company had other purchase obligations of $6.7 billion. Other Non-Current Liabilities As of March 30, 2019 , a significant portion of the other non-current liabilities in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet consisted of the $30.9 billion deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the Act. The Company plans to pay the deemed repatriation tax payable in installments in accordance with the Act. The Company’s remaining other non-current liabilities primarily consist of items for which the Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments. Apple Inc. | Q2 2019 Form 10-Q | 32 Indemnification Agreements entered into by the Company may include indemnification provisions, which may subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. Except as disclosed in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, “Commitments and Contingencies” under the heading “Contingencies,” in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to indemnification of third parties. The Company offers an iPhone Upgrade Program, which is available to customers who purchase a qualifying iPhone in the U.S., the U.K. and mainland China. The iPhone Upgrade Program provides customers the right to trade in that iPhone for a specified amount when purchasing a new iPhone, provided certain conditions are met. The Company accounts for the trade-in right as a guarantee liability and recognizes arrangement revenue net of the fair value of such right, with subsequent changes to the guarantee liability recognized within net sales. The Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers. Under these agreements, the Company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers of the Company, and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim. While the Company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates, and such differences may be material. Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of the 2018 Form 10-K, and “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in Part II, Item 7 of the 2018 Form 10-K describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements. With the exception of Revenue Recognition and Impairment of Marketable Debt Securities, there have been no material changes to the Company’s critical accounting policies and estimates since the 2018 Form 10-K. Revenue Recognition The Company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud, Siri and Maps. The third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (“SSP”). Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company’s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided. The Company’s process for determining estimated SSPs involves management’s judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. Should future facts and circumstances change, the Company’s SSPs and the future rate of related amortization for unspecified software upgrades and services related to future sales of these devices could change. Factors subject to change include the nature of the unspecified software upgrade rights and product-related bundled services offered, their estimated value and the estimated period they are expected to be provided. Apple Inc. | Q2 2019 Form 10-Q | 33 Impairment of Marketable Debt Securities The Company’s investments in marketable debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value. The Company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine if any security is other-than-temporarily impaired, which would require the Company to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made. In making this determination, the Company evaluates, among other things, the duration and extent to which the fair value of a security is less than its cost; the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto; and the Company’s intent to sell, or whether it will more likely than not be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. The Company’s assessment of whether an available-for-sale debt security is other-than-temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular security, which would have an adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk There have been no material changes to the Company’s market risk during the first six months of 2019 . For a discussion of the Company’s exposure to market risk, refer to the Company’s market risk disclosures set forth in Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” of the 2018 Form 10-K. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act were effective as of March 30, 2019 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the second quarter of 2019 , which were identified in connection with management’s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Apple Inc. | Q2 2019 Form 10-Q | 34 PART II — OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings The Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. Except as described in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, “Commitments and Contingencies” under the heading “Contingencies,” in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Refer to the risk factor “ The Company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings, such as being found to have infringed on intellectual property rights ” in Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q under the heading “Risk Factors.” The Company settled certain matters during the second quarter of 2019 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating results. Item 1A. Risk Factors The following description of risk factors includes any material changes to, and supersedes the description of, risk factors associated with the Company’s business previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of the 2018 Form 10-K and in Part II, Item 1A of the Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December 29, 2018, in each case under the heading “Risk Factors.” The business, financial condition and operating results of the Company can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described below, any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly, cause the Company’s actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from past, or from anticipated future, financial condition and operating results. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, operating results and stock price. The following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. These risk factors may be important to understanding other statements in this Form 10-Q. The following information should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part I, Item 1, “Financial Statements” and Part I, Item 2, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Form 10-Q. Because of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company’s financial condition and operating results, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. Global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and growth . The Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’s total net sales. In addition, a majority of the Company’s supply chain, and its manufacturing and assembly activities, are located outside the U.S. As a result, the Company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions. Adverse macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, slower growth or recession, new or increased tariffs, changes to fiscal and monetary policy, tighter credit, higher interest rates, high unemployment and currency fluctuations could materially adversely affect demand for the Company’s products and services. In addition, consumer confidence and spending could be adversely affected in response to financial market volatility, negative financial news, conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets, declines in income or asset values, changes to fuel and other energy costs, labor and healthcare costs and other economic factors. In addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company’s products, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic conditions could have a significant impact on the Company’s suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners. Potential effects include financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance operations and purchases of the Company’s products; and insolvency. A downturn in the economic environment could also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company’s trade receivables; the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the Company’s ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair value of the Company’s financial instruments. These and other economic factors could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and growth. Apple Inc. | Q2 2019 Form 10-Q | 35 Global markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets. The Company’s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price/performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. The Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in R&D. There can be no assurance that these investments will achieve expected returns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully. The Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to register, numerous patents, trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and emulating the Company’s products and infringing on its intellectual property. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the Company’s intellectual property, the Company’s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be adversely affected. The Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, tablet and personal computer markets. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors may have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. Additionally, the Company faces significant competition as competitors attempt to imitate the Company’s product features and applications within their own products or, alternatively, collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the Company’s approach to providing components seamlessly within their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions. Some of the markets in which the Company competes have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted. In addition, an increasing number of internet-enabled devices that include software applications and are smaller, simpler and cheaper than traditional personal computers compete with some of the Company’s existing products. The Company’s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company’s financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the Company’s ability to continually improve its products and services in order to maintain their functional and design advantages. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively. To remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services. Due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services. The success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors including, but not limited to, timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company’s ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for new products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies. Accordingly, the Company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product and service introductions and transitions. Apple Inc. | Q2 2019 Form 10-Q | 36 The Company depends on the performance of carriers, wholesalers, retailers and other resellers. The Company distributes its products through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers, many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers. The Company also sells its products and third-party products in most of its major markets directly to education, enterprise and government customers and consumers and small and mid-sized businesses through its retail and online stores. Some carriers providing cellular network service for iPhone offer financing, installment payment plans or subsidies for users’ purchases of the device. There is no assurance that such offers will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the Company’s agreements with these carriers or in agreements the Company enters into with new carriers. The Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers’ stores with Company employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays. These programs could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental sales. The financial condition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Company’s products, or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the Company’s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company’s products. The Company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk. The Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers’ facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable, no assurance can be given that the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes. The Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. Manufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company’s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for periods up to 150 days . Because the Company’s markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments. Future operating results depend upon the Company’s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms. Because the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that could materially adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and operating results. While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms. The effects of global or regional economic conditions on the Company’s suppliers, described in “ Global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and growth ” above, also could affect the Company’s ability to obtain components . Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results. The Company’s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements. If the Company’s supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company’s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. The Company’s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Apple Inc. | Q2 2019 Form 10-Q | 37 The Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of which are located outside of the U.S. Substantially all of the Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia. A significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements may lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company’s direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished control may have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products or services, or the Company’s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, the Company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect or warranty liability. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, material violations of the supplier code of conduct could occur. The Company relies on single-sourced outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many components, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company’s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform may have a negative impact on the Company’s cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations may be disrupted for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, military actions, economic, business, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, or international trade disputes. The Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply could be reduced or terminated and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments could be negatively impacted. The Company’s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the Company’s business and result in harm to the Company’s reputation. The Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the Company, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products. Defects may also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects could make the Company’s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the Company’s products are introduced into specialized applications, including healthcare. In addition, the Company’s service offerings may have quality issues and from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, the Company’s services may not perform as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software and services it offers. Failure to do so could result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the Company’s products and services. In addition, the Company may be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property, plant and equipment, and/or intangible assets, and significant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems could also adversely affect the experience for users of the Company’s products and services, and result in harm to the Company’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales. The Company relies on access to third-party digital content, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell currently available music, movies, TV shows and books. The licensing or other distribution arrangements with these third parties are for relatively short terms and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on reasonable terms, if at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content in the future. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company’s access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules, or continue to expand its geographic reach. Failure to obtain the right to make third-party digital content available, or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results. Some third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. If requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There is no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner. In addition, certain countries have passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force the Company to license its digital rights management, which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could negatively affect arrangements with the Company’s content providers. Apple Inc. | Q2 2019 Form 10-Q | 38 The Company’s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers. The Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications and services. There is no assurance that third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the Company’s products. If third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company’s products, customers may choose not to buy the Company’s products. The Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers’ perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the Company’s products compared to competitors’ platforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets and Windows for personal computers. This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of product sales and the costs of developing such applications and services. The Company’s minority market share in the global smartphone, tablet and personal computer markets could make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company’s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors’ products with larger market share. If developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company’s devices may suffer. The Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products. The Company’s products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and if third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, third-party applications might not take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences or might not operate correctly and may result in dissatisfied customers. The Company sells and delivers third-party applications for its products through the App Store, Mac App Store and TV App Store. The Company retains a commission from sales through these platforms. If developers reduce their use of these platforms to distribute their applications and offer in-app purchases to customers, then the volume of sales, and the commission that the Company earns on those sales, would decrease. The Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Many of the Company’s products include third-party intellectual property, which requires licenses from those third parties. Based on past experience and industry practice, the Company believes such licenses generally can be obtained on reasonable terms. There is, however, no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, could preclude the Company from selling certain products or services, or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results. The Company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings, such as being found to have infringed on intellectual property rights . The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved, and new claims may arise in the future. In addition, agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which may subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. Claims against the Company based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights have generally increased over time and may continue to increase. In particular, the Company has historically faced a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled products, and new claims may arise in the future. For example, technology and other patent-holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in a number of U.S. jurisdictions and before the U.S. International Trade Commission, as well as internationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages. Regardless of the merit of particular claims, litigation may be expensive, time consuming, disruptive to the Company’s operations and distracting to management. In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into licensing agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such disputes. No assurance can be given that such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These agreements may also significantly increase the Company’s cost of sales and operating expenses. Apple Inc. | Q2 2019 Form 10-Q | 39 Except as described in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, “Commitments and Contingencies” under the heading “Contingencies,” in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims, including matters related to infringement of intellectual property rights. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome could result in significant compensatory, punitive or trebled monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results. While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise. The Company is subject to laws and regulations worldwide, changes to which could increase the Company’s costs and individually or in the aggregate adversely affect the Company’s business. The Company is subject to laws and regulations affecting its domestic and international operations in a number of areas. These U.S. and foreign laws and regulations affect the Company’s activities in areas including, but not limited to, labor, advertising, digital content, availability of third-party software applications and services, consumer protection, real estate, billing, e-commerce, promotions, quality of services, telecommunications, mobile communications and media, television, intellectual property ownership and infringement, tax, import and export requirements, anti-corruption, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy and data localization requirements, anti-competition, environmental, health and safety. By way of example, laws and regulations related to mobile communications and media devices in the many jurisdictions in which the Company operates are extensive and subject to change. Such changes could include, among others, restrictions on the production, manufacture, distribution and use of devices, locking devices to a carrier’s network, or mandating the use of devices on more than one carrier’s network. These devices are also subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies, as well as by cellular network carriers for use on their networks. These certification processes are extensive and time consuming, and could result in additional testing requirements, product modifications, or delays in product shipment dates, or could preclude the Company from selling certain products. Compliance with these laws, regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive, and they may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, further increasing the cost of compliance and doing business. Any such costs, which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation, could individually or in the aggregate make the Company’s products and services less attractive to the Company’s customers, delay the introduction of new products and services in one or more regions, or cause the Company to change or limit its business practices. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that the Company’s employees, contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company’s policies and procedures. The Company’s business is subject to the risks of international operations. The Company derives a majority of its net sales and earnings from its international operations. Compliance with applicable U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, such as import and export requirements, anti-corruption laws, tax laws, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy and data localization requirements, environmental laws, labor laws and anti-competition regulations, increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. Although the Company has implemented policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations, a violation by the Company’s employees, contractors or agents could nevertheless occur. In some cases, compliance with the laws and regulations of one country could violate the laws and regulations of another country. Violations of these laws and regulations could materially adversely affect the Company’s brand, international growth efforts and business. The Company also could be significantly affected by other risks associated with international activities including, but not limited to, economic and labor conditions, increased duties, taxes and other costs, political instability and international trade disputes. Gross margins on the Company’s products in foreign countries, and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, could be materially adversely affected by international trade regulations, including duties, tariffs and antidumping penalties. The Company is also exposed to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables with customers in certain international markets. There can be no assurance the Company can effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses. Apple Inc. | Q2 2019 Form 10-Q | 40 The Company’s retail stores have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. The Company’s retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory and personnel. The Company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space. Certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than the Company’s more typical retail stores. Due to the high cost structure associated with the Company’s retail stores, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance costs. The Company’s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the Company’s financial condition and operating results, including macro-economic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity. Other factors include, but are not limited to, the Company’s ability to manage costs associated with retail store construction and operation; manage relationships with existing retail partners; manage costs associated with fluctuations in the value of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost. Investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company’s ongoing business and present risks not originally contemplated. The Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater than expected liabilities and expenses, inadequate return of capital and unidentified issues not discovered in the Company’s due diligence. These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful. The Company’s business and reputation may be impacted by information technology system failures or network disruptions. The Company may be subject to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, or other events or disruptions. System redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company’s business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions could adversely impact the Company’s business by, among other things, preventing access to the Company’s online services, interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the Company’s products. These events could materially adversely affect the Company’s reputation, financial condition and operating results. There may be losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personally identifiable information, that could subject the Company to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences. The Company’s business requires it to use and store confidential information including, among other things, personally identifiable information (“PII”) with respect to the Company’s customers and employees. The Company devotes significant resources to network and data security, including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data. But these measures cannot provide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the Company’s reputation, financial condition and operating results. The Company’s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties. Although the Company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to third parties, such measures are not always effective and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the Company’s reputation, financial condition and operating results. For example, the Company may experience a security breach impacting the Company’s information technology systems that compromises the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential information. Such an incident could, among other things, impair the Company’s ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services, impact the Company’s stock price, materially damage supplier relationships, and expose the Company to litigation or government investigations, which could result in penalties, fines or judgments against the Company. Although malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information, including PII, affect many companies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and processes. Apple Inc. | Q2 2019 Form 10-Q | 41 The Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data, including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies. As with all companies, these security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty password management or other irregularities. For example, third parties attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names, passwords or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access the Company’s information technology systems. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, may result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the Company’s products and services. In addition to the risks relating to general confidential information described above, the Company may also be subject to specific obligations relating to health data and payment card data. Health data may be subject to additional privacy, security and breach notification requirements, and the Company may be subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the Company’s compliance with these obligations. If the Company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements, or if health data is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the Company’s agreements with healthcare institutions, the Company could be subject to litigation or government investigations, may be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and could also incur significant fees or fines. Under payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder information is potentially compromised, the Company could be liable for associated investigatory expenses and could also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards. The Company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards, which would materially adversely affect the Company’s reputation, financial condition and operating results. While the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise. The Company’s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding data protection. The Company is subject to federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of PII. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also may restrict transfers of PII among the Company and its international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the Company to incur substantial costs or require the Company to change its business practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability. The Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of PII through its privacy policy, information provided on its website and press statements. Any failure by the Company to comply with these public statements or with other federal, state or international privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. In addition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability. The Company’s success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key personnel. Much of the Company’s future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly skilled employees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley, where most of the Company’s key personnel are located. The Company’s business may be impacted by political events, international trade disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions. Political events, international trade disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions could harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners. International trade disputes could result in tariffs and other protectionist measures that could adversely affect the Company’s business. Tariffs could increase the cost of the Company’s products and the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs could adversely impact the gross margin that the Company earns on its products. Tariffs could also make the Company’s products more expensive for customers, which could make the Company’s products less competitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also adopt other protectionist measures that could limit the Company’s ability to offer its products and services. Political uncertainty surrounding international trade disputes and protectionist measures could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company’s business. Apple Inc. | Q2 2019 Form 10-Q | 42 Many of the Company’s operations and facilities as well as critical business operations of the Company’s suppliers and contract manufacturers are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, labor disputes, public health issues and other events beyond the Company’s control. Global climate change could result in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Such events could make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company’s supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company’s service offerings. Following an interruption to its business, the Company could require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures in order to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company. The Company’s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While the Company’s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in disruption to the Company’s business and harm to the Company’s reputation. Should major public health issues, including pandemics, arise, the Company could be adversely affected by more stringent employee travel restrictions, additional limitations in freight services, governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions, delays in production ramps of new products, and disruptions in the operations of the Company’s suppliers and contract manufacturers. The Company expects its quarterly net sales and operating results to fluctuate. The Company’s profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For example, gross margins on the Company’s hardware products vary across product lines and can change over time as a result of product transitions, pricing and configuration changes, and component, warranty and other cost fluctuations. The Company’s financial results may be materially adversely impacted as a result of shifts in the mix of products and services that the Company sells; shifts in the geographic, currency or channel mix of the Company’s sales; component cost increases; increases in the cost of acquiring and delivering content for the Company’s services; price competition; or the introduction of new products or services, including new products or services with higher cost structures. The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a majority of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company’s products or services, issues with new product or service introductions, information technology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company’s logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners. The Company’s stock price is subject to volatility. The Company’s stock price has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, the Company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies’ operating performance. Price volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its own stock to exceed the stock’s price at a given point in time. The Company believes its stock price should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability. The Company also believes its stock price should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow, and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Company’s Board of Directors, and the Company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, its stock price may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention. The Company’s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies. The Company’s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non–U.S. dollar–denominated sales, cost of sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company’s products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company’s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar’s strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency–denominated sales. Apple Inc. | Q2 2019 Form 10-Q | 43 Conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Company’s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins. The Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place. The Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio. The Company’s investments can be negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and economic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results. The Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen. The Company distributes its products through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. The Company also sells its products directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the Company’s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance. The Company’s exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of March 30, 2019 , a significant portion of the Company’s trade receivables was concentrated within cellular network carriers, and its vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses. The Company could be subject to changes in its tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. The Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland, where a number of the Company’s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. The Company’s effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including in the U.S. and Ireland. The Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company’s effective tax rates were to increase, particularly in the U.S. or Ireland, or if the ultimate determination of the Company’s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company’s financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.

The remaining $38.7 billion in the table represents the amount available to repurchase shares under the authorized repurchase program as of March 30, 2019 . On April 30, 2019 , the Company announced the Board of Directors had increased the share repurchase program authorization from $100 billion to $175 billion . The Company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. Under this program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act. (2) In February 2019, the Company entered into a new ASR to purchase up to $12.0 billion of the Company’s common stock. In exchange for up-front payments totaling $12.0 billion , the financial institutions that are party to the arrangement committed to deliver shares to the Company during the ASR’s purchase period, which will end in or before August 2019. The total number of shares ultimately delivered, and therefore the average price paid per share, will be determined at the end of the applicable purchase period based on the volume-weighted average price of the Company’s common stock during that period.

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Apple Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively “Apple” or the “Company”) designs, manufactures and markets mobile communication and media devices and personal computers, and sells a variety of related software, services, accessories and third-party digital content and applications. The Company’s products and services include iPhone ® , Mac ® , iPad ® , Apple Watch ® , AirPods ® , Apple TV ® , HomePod™, a portfolio of consumer and professional software applications, iOS, macOS ® , watchOS ® and tvOS ® operating systems, iCloud ® , Apple Pay ® and a variety of accessory, service and support offerings. The Company sells and delivers digital content and applications through the iTunes Store ® , App Store ® , Mac App Store, TV App Store, Book Store and Apple Music ® (collectively “Digital Content and Services”). The Company sells its products worldwide through its retail stores, online stores and direct sales force, as well as through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. In addition, the Company sells a variety of third-party Apple-compatible products, including application software and various accessories, through its retail and online stores. The Company sells to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. Basis of Presentation and Preparation The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. In the opinion of the Company’s management, the condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation. These condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the Company’s annual consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2018 (the “ 2018 Form 10-K”). The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. A 14th week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. The Company’s fiscal years 2019 and 2018 span 52 weeks each. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Revenue Recognition In the first quarter of 2019, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (the “FASB”) Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (“ASU 2014-09”), and additional ASUs issued to clarify the guidance in ASU 2014-09 (collectively the “new revenue standard”), which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. The Company adopted the new revenue standard utilizing the full retrospective transition method. The Company did not restate total net sales in the prior periods presented, as adoption of the new revenue standard did not have a material impact on previously reported amounts. Additionally, beginning in the first quarter of 2019, the Company classified the amortization of the deferred value of Maps, Siri ® and free iCloud services, which are bundled in the sales price of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products, in Services net sales. Historically, the Company classified the amortization of these amounts in Products net sales consistent with its management reporting framework. As a result, Products and Services net sales information for the first quarter of 2018 was reclassified to conform to the 2019 presentation. Financial Instruments In the first quarter of 2019, the Company adopted FASB ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments – Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (“ASU 2016-01”), which updates certain aspects of the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. The adoption of ASU 2016-01 did not have a material impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements. Apple Inc. | Q1 2019 Form 10-Q | 6 Income Taxes In the first quarter of 2019, the Company adopted FASB ASU No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory (“ASU 2016-16”), which requires the recognition of the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs. The Company adopted ASU 2016-16 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. Upon adoption, the Company recorded $2.7 billion of net deferred tax assets, reduced other non-current assets by $128 million , and increased retained earnings by $2.6 billion on its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company will recognize incremental deferred income tax expense as these net deferred tax assets are utilized. Earnings Per Share The following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the three months ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 (net income in millions and shares in thousands): Three Months Ended December 29, 2018 December 30, 2017 Numerator: Net income $ 19,965 $ 20,065 Denominator: Weighted-average basic shares outstanding 4,735,820 5,112,877 Effect of dilutive securities 37,432 44,910 Weighted-average diluted shares 4,773,252 5,157,787 Basic earnings per share $ 4.22 $ 3.92 Diluted earnings per share $ 4.18 $ 3.89 Potentially dilutive securities representing 28.8 million shares of common stock were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for the three months ended December 29, 2018 because their effect would have been antidilutive. Note 2 – Revenue Recognition Net sales consist of revenue from the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad, services and other products. The Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is transferred to its customers. Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company’s products net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company’s services net sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered. Payment for products and services net sales is collected within a short period of time following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable. The Company records reductions to products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer incentive programs based on the Company’s expectations and historical experience. For arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are capable of being distinct, the Company allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (“SSP”). When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine the SSP. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are established that reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company’s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation. Apple Inc. | Q1 2019 Form 10-Q | 7 The Company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud, Siri and Maps. The third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company’s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided. Cost of sales related to delivered hardware and bundled software, including estimated warranty costs, are recognized at the time of sale. Costs incurred to provide product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights are recognized as cost of sales as incurred. For certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For these arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized revenue, and has elected not to disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services. For the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products including, but not limited to, evaluating if it has the ability to establish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party applications sold through the App Store, Mac App Store and TV App Store and certain digital content sold through the iTunes Store, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for such sales on a net basis by recognizing in services net sales only the commission it retains. The Company has elected to record revenue net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities, with the collected taxes recorded within other current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority. Deferred Revenue As of December 29, 2018 and September 29, 2018 , the Company had total deferred revenue of $8.4 billion and $8.8 billion , respectively. As of December 29, 2018 , the Company expects 66% of total deferred revenue to be realized in less than a year, 27% within one-to-two years, 6% within two-to-three years and 1% in greater than three years. Disaggregated Revenue Net sales disaggregated by significant products and services for the three months ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 were as follows (in millions): Three Months Ended December 29, 2018 December 30, 2017 iPhone (1) $ 51,982 $ 61,104 Mac (1) 7,416 6,824 iPad (1) 6,729 5,755 Wearables, Home and Accessories (1)(2) 7,308 5,481 Services (3) 10,875 9,129 Total net sales (4) $ 84,310 $ 88,293 (1) Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are bundled in the sales price of the respective product. (2) Wearables, Home and Accessories net sales include sales of AirPods, Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats® products, HomePod, iPod touch® and Apple-branded and third-party accessories. (3) Services net sales include sales from Digital Content and Services, AppleCare®, Apple Pay, licensing and other services. Services net sales also include amortization of the deferred value of Maps, Siri and free iCloud services, which are bundled in the sales price of certain products. (4) Includes $2.4 billion and $2.0 billion of revenue recognized in the three months ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 , respectively, that was included in deferred revenue at the beginning of each respective period. Apple Inc. | Q1 2019 Form 10-Q | 8 The Company’s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable segment in Note 11, “Segment Information and Geographic Data” for the three months ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 . Note 3 – Financial Instruments Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities The Company’s investments in marketable debt securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. The Company classifies its marketable debt securities as either short-term or long-term based on each instrument’s underlying contractual maturity date. Unrealized gains and losses on marketable debt securities classified as available-for-sale are recognized in other comprehensive income/(loss) (“OCI”). The Company’s investments in mutual funds represent its only marketable equity securities and are classified as short-term based on the nature of the securities and their availability for use in current operations. The Company’s marketable equity securities are measured at fair value with gains and losses recognized in other income/(expense), net. The following tables show the Company’s cash and marketable securities by significant investment category as of December 29, 2018 and September 29, 2018 (in millions): December 29, 2018 Adjusted Cost Unrealized Gains Unrealized Losses Fair Value Cash and Cash Equivalents Short-Term Marketable Securities Long-Term Marketable Securities Cash $ 9,489 $ — $ — $ 9,489 $ 9,489 $ — $ — Level 1 (1) : Money market funds 6,424 — — 6,424 6,424 — — Mutual funds 682 — — 682 — 682 — Subtotal 7,106 — — 7,106 6,424 682 — Level 2 (2) : U.S. Treasury securities 46,191 6 (729 ) 45,468 3,923 6,415 35,130 U.S. agency securities 9,731 — (31 ) 9,700 7,552 597 1,551 Non-U.S. government securities 23,460 48 (289 ) 23,219 1,895 4,129 17,195 Certificates of deposit and time deposits 5,349 — — 5,349 3,705 1,348 296 Commercial paper 11,953 — — 11,953 11,679 274 — Corporate debt securities 117,260 32 (2,387 ) 114,905 104 27,134 87,667 Municipal securities 953 1 (7 ) 947 — 187 760 Mortgage- and asset-backed securities 17,320 7 (428 ) 16,899 — 890 16,009 Subtotal 232,217 94 (3,871 ) 228,440 28,858 40,974 158,608 Total (3) $ 248,812 $ 94 $ (3,871 ) $ 245,035 $ 44,771 $ 41,656 $ 158,608 Apple Inc. | Q1 2019 Form 10-Q | 9 September 29, 2018 Adjusted Cost Unrealized Gains Unrealized Losses Fair Value Cash and Cash Equivalents Short-Term Marketable Securities Long-Term Marketable Securities Cash $ 11,575 $ — $ — $ 11,575 $ 11,575 $ — $ — Level 1 (1) : Money market funds 8,083 — — 8,083 8,083 — — Mutual funds 799 — (116 ) 683 — 683 — Subtotal 8,882 — (116 ) 8,766 8,083 683 — Level 2 (2) : U.S. Treasury securities 47,296 — (1,202 ) 46,094 1,613 7,606 36,875 U.S. agency securities 4,127 — (48 ) 4,079 1,732 360 1,987 Non-U.S. government securities 21,601 49 (250 ) 21,400 — 3,355 18,045 Certificates of deposit and time deposits 3,074 — — 3,074 1,247 1,330 497 Commercial paper 2,573 — — 2,573 1,663 910 — Corporate debt securities 123,001 152 (2,038 ) 121,115 — 25,162 95,953 Municipal securities 946 — (12 ) 934 — 178 756 Mortgage- and asset-backed securities 18,105 8 (623 ) 17,490 — 804 16,686 Subtotal 220,723 209 (4,173 ) 216,759 6,255 39,705 170,799 Total (3) $ 241,180 $ 209 $ (4,289 ) $ 237,100 $ 25,913 $ 40,388 $ 170,799 (1) Level 1 fair value estimates are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

(3) As of December 29, 2018 and September 29, 2018 , total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities included $19.9 billion and $20.3 billion , respectively, that was restricted from general use, related to the State Aid Decision (refer to Note 5, “Income Taxes”) and other agreements. The Company may sell certain of its marketable debt securities prior to their stated maturities for reasons including, but not limited to, managing liquidity, credit risk, duration and asset allocation. The maturities of the Company’s long-term marketable debt securities generally range from one to five years . The following tables show information about the Company’s marketable securities that had been in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than 12 months and for 12 months or greater as of December 29, 2018 and September 29, 2018 (in millions): December 29, 2018 Continuous Unrealized Losses Less than 12 Months 12 Months or Greater Total Fair value of marketable debt securities $ 53,336 $ 127,006 $ 180,342 Unrealized losses $ (1,153 ) $ (2,718 ) $ (3,871 ) September 29, 2018 Continuous Unrealized Losses Less than 12 Months 12 Months or Greater Total Fair value of marketable securities $ 126,238 $ 60,599 $ 186,837 Unrealized losses $ (2,400 ) $ (1,889 ) $ (4,289 ) Apple Inc. | Q1 2019 Form 10-Q | 10 The Company typically invests in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company’s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. Fair values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. When evaluating a marketable debt security for other-than-temporary impairment, the Company reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below its cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto, changes in market interest rates and the Company’s intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the security before recovery of the security’s cost basis. As of December 29, 2018 , the Company does not consider any of its marketable debt securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired. Non-Marketable Securities The Company holds non-marketable equity securities of certain privately held companies without readily determinable fair values, and has elected to apply the measurement alternative. As such, the Company’s non-marketable equity securities are measured at cost, less any impairment, and are adjusted for changes in fair value resulting from observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. Gains and losses on non-marketable equity securities are recognized in other income/(expense), net. As of December 29, 2018 , the Company’s non-marketable equity securities had a carrying value of $2.2 billion . The Company holds a non-marketable debt security that is classified and accounted for as held-to-maturity. As of December 29, 2018 , the Company’s non-marketable debt security had an amortized cost basis and carrying value of $1.5 billion . Derivative Financial Instruments The Company may use derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risk on expected future cash flows, net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries, and certain existing assets and liabilities. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign currency exchange or interest rates. To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar may hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue, and subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar may hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries’ functional currencies. The Company may enter into forward contracts, option contracts or other instruments to manage this risk and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months . To protect the net investment in a foreign operation from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset a portion of the changes in the carrying amounts of these investments due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, the Company may use non-derivative financial instruments, such as its foreign currency–denominated debt, as hedges of its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries. In both of these cases, the Company designates these instruments as net investment hedges. To protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. These instruments may offset a portion of the foreign currency remeasurement gains or losses, or changes in fair value. The Company may designate these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of December 29, 2018 , the Company’s hedged term debt– and marketable securities–related foreign currency transactions are expected to be recognized within 24 years . The Company may also enter into non-designated foreign currency contracts to offset a portion of the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. To protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. These instruments may offset a portion of the changes in interest income or expense, or changes in fair value. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of December 29, 2018 , the Company’s hedged interest rate transactions are expected to be recognized within 9 years . Apple Inc. | Q1 2019 Form 10-Q | 11 Cash Flow Hedges The effective portions of cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (“AOCI”) until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of foreign currency revenue are recognized as a component of net sales in the same period as the related revenue is recognized, and deferred gains and losses related to cash flow hedges of inventory purchases are recognized as a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related costs are recognized. Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of interest income or expense are recognized in other income/(expense), net in the same period as the related income or expense is recognized. For options designated as cash flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. The ineffective portions and amounts excluded from the effectiveness testing of cash flow hedges are recognized in other income/(expense), net. Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially identified time period or within a subsequent two-month time period. Deferred gains and losses in AOCI associated with such derivative instruments are reclassified into other income/(expense), net in the period of de-designation. Any subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are reflected in other income/(expense), net unless they are re-designated as hedges of other transactions. Net Investment Hedges The effective portions of net investment hedges are recorded in OCI as a part of the cumulative translation adjustment. The ineffective portions and amounts excluded from the effectiveness testing of net investment hedges are recognized in other income/(expense), net. For forward exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges, the Company excludes changes in fair value relating to changes in the forward carry component from its definition of effectiveness. Accordingly, any gains or losses related to this forward carry component are recognized in earnings in the current period. Fair Value Hedges Gains and losses related to changes in fair value hedges are recognized in earnings along with a corresponding loss or gain related to the change in value of the underlying hedged item in the same line in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. Non-Designated Derivatives Derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are adjusted to fair value through earnings in the financial statement line item to which the derivative relates. As a result, during the three months ended December 29, 2018 , the Company recognized a gain of $255 million in net sales, a gain of $175 million in cost of sales and a gain of $723 million in other income/(expense), net. The Company records all derivatives in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The Company’s accounting treatment for these derivative instruments is based on its hedge designation. The following tables show the Company’s derivative instruments at gross fair value as of December 29, 2018 and September 29, 2018 (in millions): December 29, 2018 Fair Value of Derivatives Designated as Hedge Instruments Fair Value of Derivatives Not Designated as Hedge Instruments Total Fair Value Derivative assets (1) : Foreign exchange contracts $ 1,110 $ 419 $ 1,529 Interest rate contracts $ 22 $ — $ 22 Derivative liabilities (2) : Foreign exchange contracts $ 701 $ 345 $ 1,046 Interest rate contracts $ 821 $ — $ 821 Apple Inc. | Q1 2019 Form 10-Q | 12 September 29, 2018 Fair Value of Derivatives Designated as Hedge Instruments Fair Value of Derivatives Not Designated as Hedge Instruments Total Fair Value Derivative assets (1) : Foreign exchange contracts $ 1,015 $ 259 $ 1,274 Derivative liabilities (2) : Foreign exchange contracts $ 543 $ 137 $ 680 Interest rate contracts $ 1,456 $ — $ 1,456 (1) The fair value of derivative assets is measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and is recorded as other current assets and other non-current assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. (2) The fair value of derivative liabilities is measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and is recorded as other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company classifies cash flows related to derivative financial instruments as operating activities in its Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The following table shows the pre-tax gains and losses of the Company’s derivative and non-derivative instruments designated as cash flow, net investment and fair value hedges in OCI and the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three months ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 (in millions): Three Months Ended December 29, 2018 December 30, 2017 Gains/(Losses) recognized in OCI – effective portion: Cash flow hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ (478 ) $ 153 Interest rate contracts — 1 Total $ (478 ) $ 154 Net investment hedges: Foreign currency debt $ (16 ) $ 2 Gains/(Losses) reclassified from AOCI into net income – effective portion: Cash flow hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ (118 ) $ (124 ) Interest rate contracts (1 ) 1 Total $ (119 ) $ (123 ) Gains/(Losses) on derivative instruments: Fair value hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ 402 $ — Interest rate contracts 657 (274 ) Total $ 1,059 $ (274 ) Gains/(Losses) related to hedged items: Fair value hedges: Marketable securities $ (402 ) $ — Fixed-rate debt (657 ) 274 Total $ (1,059 ) $ 274 Apple Inc. | Q1 2019 Form 10-Q | 13 The following table shows the notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments and credit risk amounts associated with outstanding or unsettled derivative instruments as of December 29, 2018 and September 29, 2018 (in millions): December 29, 2018 September 29, 2018 Notional Amount Credit Risk Amount Notional Amount Credit Risk Amount Instruments designated as accounting hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ 56,000 $ 1,110 $ 65,368 $ 1,015 Interest rate contracts $ 33,250 $ 22 $ 33,250 $ — Instruments not designated as accounting hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ 82,013 $ 419 $ 63,062 $ 259 The notional amounts for outstanding derivative instruments provide one measure of the transaction volume outstanding and do not represent the amount of the Company’s exposure to credit or market loss. The credit risk amounts represent the Company’s gross exposure to potential accounting loss on derivative instruments that are outstanding or unsettled if all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current currency or interest rates at each respective date. The Company’s exposure to credit loss and market risk will vary over time as currency and interest rates change. Although the table above reflects the notional and credit risk amounts of the Company’s derivative instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses associated with the exposures and transactions that the instruments are intended to hedge. The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments. The Company generally enters into master netting arrangements, which are designed to reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. The Company presents its derivative assets and derivative liabilities at their gross fair values in its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The net cash collateral posted by the Company related to derivative instruments under its collateral security arrangements was $56 million and $1.0 billion as of December 29, 2018 and September 29, 2018 , respectively, which were recorded as other current assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Under master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to the Company’s derivative contracts, the Company is allowed to net settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of December 29, 2018 and September 29, 2018 , the potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the Company’s derivative contracts, including the effects of collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $1.9 billion and $2.1 billion , respectively, resulting in a net derivative liability of $260 million and a net derivative asset of $138 million , respectively. Accounts Receivable Trade Receivables The Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, resellers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral or third-party credit support in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements. As of December 29, 2018 , the Company had no customers that individually represented 10% or more of total trade receivables. As of September 29, 2018 , the Company had one customer that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, which accounted for 10% . The Company’s cellular network carriers accounted for 45% and 59% of total trade receivables as of December 29, 2018 and September 29, 2018 , respectively. Vendor Non-Trade Receivables The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. As of December 29, 2018 , the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 56% and 15% . As of September 29, 2018 , the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 62% and 12% . Apple Inc. | Q1 2019 Form 10-Q | 14 Note 4 – Condensed Consolidated Financial Statement Details The following tables show the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statement details as of December 29, 2018 and September 29, 2018 (in millions): Property, Plant and Equipment, Net December 29, 2018 September 29, 2018 Land and buildings $ 16,352 $ 16,216 Machinery, equipment and internal-use software 66,823 65,982 Leasehold improvements 8,351 8,205 Gross property, plant and equipment 91,526 90,403 Accumulated depreciation and amortization (51,929 ) (49,099 ) Total property, plant and equipment, net $ 39,597 $ 41,304 Other Non-Current Liabilities December 29, 2018 September 29, 2018 Long-term taxes payable $ 30,948 $ 33,589 Other non-current liabilities 23,607 15,325 Total other non-current liabilities $ 54,555 $ 48,914 Other Income/(Expense), Net The following table shows the detail of other income/(expense), net for the three months ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 (in millions): Three Months Ended December 29, 2018 December 30, 2017 Interest and dividend income $ 1,307 $ 1,452 Interest expense (890 ) (734 ) Other income, net 143 38 Total other income/(expense), net $ 560 $ 756 Note 5 – Income Taxes U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”), which significantly changed U.S. tax law. The Act lowered the Company’s U.S. statutory federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, while also imposing a deemed repatriation tax on previously deferred foreign income. The Act also created a new minimum tax on certain future foreign earnings. The Company completed its accounting for the income tax effects of the Act during the first quarter of 2019, in accordance with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118. Uncertain Tax Positions As of December 29, 2018 , the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $14.7 billion , of which $8.2 billion , if recognized, would impact the Company’s effective tax rate. The Company had accrued $1.2 billion of gross interest and penalties as of December 29, 2018 . Both the unrecognized tax benefits and the associated interest and penalties that are not expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one year are classified as other non-current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. Apple Inc. | Q1 2019 Form 10-Q | 15 The Company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service concluded its review of the years 2013 through 2015 in 2018, and all years prior to 2016 are closed. Tax years subsequent to 2006 in certain major U.S. states and subsequent to 2010 in certain major foreign jurisdictions remain open, and could be subject to examination by the taxing authorities. The Company believes that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Company’s tax audits are resolved in a manner inconsistent with its expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs. Although timing of resolution and/or closure of audits is not certain, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that its gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease (either by payment, release or a combination of both) in the next 12 months by as much as $300 million . European Commission State Aid Decision On August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company (the “State Aid Decision”). The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. The recovery amount was calculated to be €13.1 billion , plus interest of €1.2 billion . Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The Company believes the State Aid Decision to be without merit and appealed to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union. Ireland has also appealed the State Aid Decision. The Company believes that any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision would be creditable against U.S. taxes, subject to any foreign tax credit limitations in the Act. As of December 29, 2018 , the entire recovery amount plus interest was funded into escrow, where it will remain restricted from general use pending conclusion of all appeals. Refer to Note 3, “Financial Instruments” for more information. Note 6 – Debt Commercial Paper The Company issues unsecured short-term promissory notes (“Commercial Paper”) pursuant to a commercial paper program. The Company uses net proceeds from the commercial paper program for general corporate purposes, including dividends and share repurchases. As of both December 29, 2018 and September 29, 2018 , the Company had $12.0 billion of Commercial Paper outstanding with maturities generally less than nine months . The weighted-average interest rate of the Company’s Commercial Paper was 2.39% as of December 29, 2018 and 2.18% as of September 29, 2018 . The following table provides a summary of cash flows associated with the issuance and maturities of Commercial Paper for the three months ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 (in millions): Three Months Ended December 29, 2018 December 30, 2017 Maturities 90 days or less: Proceeds from/(Repayments of) commercial paper, net $ 2,011 $ 1,621 Maturities greater than 90 days: Proceeds from commercial paper 2,166 3,441 Repayments of commercial paper (4,171 ) (5,060 ) Proceeds from/(Repayments of) commercial paper, net (2,005 ) (1,619 ) Total change in commercial paper, net $ 6 $ 2 Term Debt As of December 29, 2018 , the Company had outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $103.8 billion (collectively the “Notes”). The Notes are senior unsecured obligations, and interest is payable in arrears, quarterly for the U.S. dollar–denominated and Australian dollar–denominated floating-rate notes, semi-annually for the U.S. dollar–denominated, Australian dollar–denominated, British pound–denominated, Japanese yen–denominated and Canadian dollar–denominated fixed-rate notes and annually for the euro-denominated and Swiss franc–denominated fixed-rate notes.

Additionally, to manage foreign currency risk on certain of its foreign currency–denominated notes, the Company has entered into foreign currency swaps to effectively convert these notes to U.S. dollar–denominated notes. A portion of the Company’s Japanese yen–denominated notes is designated as a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of the Company’s net investment in a foreign operation. As of December 29, 2018 and September 29, 2018 , the carrying value of the debt designated as a net investment hedge was $1.0 billion and $811 million , respectively. For further discussion regarding the Company’s use of derivative instruments, refer to the Derivative Financial Instruments section of Note 3, “Financial Instruments.” The effective interest rates for the Notes include the interest on the Notes, amortization of the discount or premium and, if applicable, adjustments related to hedging. The Company recognized $809 million and $695 million of interest expense on its term debt for the three months ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 , respectively. As of December 29, 2018 and September 29, 2018 , the fair value of the Company’s Notes, based on Level 2 inputs, was $102.6 billion and $103.2 billion , respectively. Note 7 – Shareholders’ Equity Share Repurchase Program On May 1, 2018, the Company announced the Board of Directors had authorized a program to repurchase up to $100 billion of the Company’s common stock, of which $37.3 billion had been utilized as of December 29, 2018 . During the three months ended December 29, 2018 , the Company repurchased 38.0 million shares of its common stock for $8.2 billion . The Company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. Under this program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Apple Inc. | Q1 2019 Form 10-Q | 17 Note 8 – Comprehensive Income The Company’s OCI consists of foreign currency translation adjustments from those subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, net deferred gains and losses on certain derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges and unrealized gains and losses on marketable debt securities classified as available-for-sale. The following table shows the pre-tax amounts reclassified from AOCI into the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, and the associated financial statement line item, for the three months ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 (in millions): Three Months Ended Comprehensive Income Components Financial Statement Line Item December 29, 2018 December 30, 2017 Unrealized (gains)/losses on derivative instruments: Foreign exchange contracts Total net sales $ 63 $ 184 Total cost of sales (375 ) (27 ) Other income/(expense), net 396 (33 ) Interest rate contracts Other income/(expense), net 1 (1 ) 85 123 Unrealized (gains)/losses on marketable securities Other income/(expense), net 47 (116 ) Total amounts reclassified from AOCI $ 132 $ 7 The following table shows the changes in AOCI by component for the three months ended December 29, 2018 (in millions): Cumulative Foreign Currency Translation Unrealized Gains/Losses on Derivative Instruments Unrealized Gains/Losses on Marketable Securities Total Balances as of September 29, 2018 $ (1,055 ) $ 810 $ (3,209 ) $ (3,454 ) Other comprehensive income/(loss) before reclassifications (82 ) (472 ) 140 (414 ) Amounts reclassified from AOCI — 85 47 132 Tax effect 4 95 (40 ) 59 Other comprehensive income/(loss) (78 ) (292 ) 147 (223 ) Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle (1) — — 89 89 Balances as of December 29, 2018 $ (1,133 ) $ 518 $ (2,973 ) $ (3,588 ) (1) Refer to Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” for more information on the Company’s adoption of ASU 2016-01 at the beginning of the first quarter of 2019. Note 9 – Benefit Plans Stock Plans The Company had 237.9 million shares reserved for future issuance under its stock plans as of December 29, 2018 . Restricted stock units (“RSUs”) granted under the Company’s stock plans generally vest over four years , based on continued employment, and are settled upon vesting in shares of the Company’s common stock on a one -for-one basis. Each share issued with respect to RSUs granted under the Company’s stock plans reduces the number of shares available for grant under the plans by two shares. RSUs canceled and shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations increase the number of shares available for grant under the plans utilizing a factor of two times the number of RSUs canceled or shares withheld. Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans During the three months ended December 29, 2018 , Section 16 officers Angela Ahrendts, Timothy D. Cook, Chris Kondo, Luca Maestri and Jeffrey Williams had equity trading plans in place in accordance with Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) under the Exchange Act. An equity trading plan is a written document that pre-establishes the amounts, prices and dates (or formula for determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of the Company’s stock, including shares acquired pursuant to the Company’s employee and director equity plans. Apple Inc. | Q1 2019 Form 10-Q | 18 Restricted Stock Units A summary of the Company’s RSU activity and related information for the three months ended December 29, 2018 is as follows: Number of RSUs (in thousands) Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value Per RSU Aggregate Fair Value (in millions) Balance as of September 29, 2018 92,155 $ 134.60 RSUs granted 29,228 $ 223.41 RSUs vested (18,935 ) $ 124.36 RSUs canceled (1,147 ) $ 154.53 Balance as of December 29, 2018 101,301 $ 161.91 $ 15,826 The fair value as of the respective vesting dates of RSUs was $4.1 billion and $3.1 billion for the three months ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 , respectively. Share-Based Compensation The following table shows share-based compensation expense and the related income tax benefit included in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three months ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 (in millions): Three Months Ended December 29, 2018 December 30, 2017 Share-based compensation expense $ 1,559 $ 1,296 Income tax benefit related to share-based compensation expense $ (750 ) $ (631 ) As of December 29, 2018 , the total unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding RSUs and stock options was $14.0 billion , which the Company expects to recognize over a weighted-average period of 2.9 years . Note 10 – Commitments and Contingencies Accrued Warranty and Indemnification The following table shows changes in the Company’s accrued warranties and related costs for the three months ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 (in millions): Three Months Ended December 29, 2018 December 30, 2017 Beginning accrued warranty and related costs $ 3,692 $ 3,834 Cost of warranty claims (996 ) (982 ) Accruals for product warranty 1,123 1,471 Ending accrued warranty and related costs $ 3,819 $ 4,323 Agreements entered into by the Company may include indemnification provisions, which may subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. Except as disclosed under the heading “Contingencies” below, in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to indemnification of third parties. The Company offers an iPhone Upgrade Program, which is available to customers who purchase a qualifying iPhone in the U.S., the U.K. and mainland China. The iPhone Upgrade Program provides customers the right to trade in that iPhone for a specified amount when purchasing a new iPhone, provided certain conditions are met. The Company accounts for the trade-in right as a guarantee liability and recognizes arrangement revenue net of the fair value of such right, with subsequent changes to the guarantee liability recognized within net sales. Apple Inc. | Q1 2019 Form 10-Q | 19 The Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers. Under these agreements, the Company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers of the Company, and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim. While the Company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise. Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product Although most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. In addition, the Company competes for various components with other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices and personal computers. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that could materially adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and operating results. The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. If the Company’s supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company’s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. The Company’s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements. The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results. Substantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia, with some Mac computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland. A significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Certain of these outsourcing partners are single-sourced suppliers of components and manufacturers for many of the Company’s products. Although the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the Company’s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production commitments. The Company’s manufacturing purchase obligations typically cover its requirements for periods up to 150 days . Other Off–Balance Sheet Commitments Operating Leases The Company leases various equipment and facilities, including retail space, under noncancelable operating lease arrangements. The Company does not currently utilize any other off–balance sheet financing arrangements. As of December 29, 2018 , the Company’s total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases were $9.9 billion . The Company’s retail store and other facility leases typically have original terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multi-year renewal options. Unconditional Purchase Obligations The Company has entered into certain off–balance sheet commitments that require the future purchase of goods or services (“unconditional purchase obligations”). The Company’s unconditional purchase obligations primarily consist of payments for supplier arrangements, internet and telecommunication services, intellectual property licenses and content creation. As of December 29, 2018 , the Company’s total future payments under noncancelable unconditional purchase obligations having a remaining term in excess of one year were $7.4 billion . Apple Inc. | Q1 2019 Form 10-Q | 20 Contingencies The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully adjudicated, as further discussed in Part II, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q under the heading “Legal Proceedings” and in Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q under the heading “Risk Factors.” The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims, except for the following matters: VirnetX VirnetX, Inc. filed two lawsuits in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas (the “Eastern Texas District Court”) against the Company alleging that certain Company products infringe four patents (the “VirnetX Patents”) relating to network communications technology (“VirnetX I” and “VirnetX II”). On September 30, 2016, a jury returned a verdict in VirnetX I against the Company and awarded damages of $302 million , which later increased to $440 million in post-trial proceedings. The Company appealed the VirnetX I verdict to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (the “Federal Circuit”). On April 11, 2018, a jury returned a verdict in VirnetX II against the Company and awarded damages of $503 million . VirnetX II is currently on appeal. The Company has challenged the validity of the VirnetX Patents at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the “PTO”). In response, the PTO has declared the VirnetX Patents invalid. VirnetX appealed the invalidity decision of the PTO to the Federal Circuit. The Federal Circuit consolidated the Company’s appeal of the Eastern Texas District Court VirnetX I verdict and VirnetX’s appeals from the PTO invalidity proceedings. On January 15, 2019, the Federal Circuit affirmed the VirnetX I verdict, which the Company intends to further appeal. The remaining appeals from the PTO proceedings invalidating the VirnetX Patents remain pending. Qualcomm On January 20, 2017, the Company filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm Incorporated and affiliated parties (“Qualcomm”) in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California seeking, among other things, to enjoin Qualcomm from requiring the Company to pay royalties at the rate demanded by Qualcomm. As the Company does not believe the demanded royalty it has historically paid contract manufacturers for each applicable device is fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory, and believes it to be invalid and/or overstated in other respects as well, no Qualcomm-related royalty payments have been remitted by the Company to its contract manufacturers since the beginning of the second quarter of 2017. The Company believes it will prevail on the merits of the case and has accrued its best estimate for the ultimate resolution of this matter. Following the Company’s lawsuit, Qualcomm has filed patent infringement suits against the Company and its affiliates in the U.S. and various international jurisdictions, some of which seek to enjoin the sale of certain of the Company’s products in particular countries. In one matter pending in China, on November 30, 2018, a court issued an order enjoining the sale in China of certain iPhone models running iOS 10 or iOS 11. The Company has taken steps to comply with the order and has deployed a software update to address the functionality at issue. The Company has sought reconsideration and a declaration of compliance with the order and has appealed the decision. In another matter pending in Germany, on December 20, 2018, a court issued an order enjoining the sale in Germany by the Company and certain of its subsidiaries of iPhone 7, 7 Plus, 8, 8 Plus and X. The Company has taken steps to comply with the order and has appealed the decision. iOS Performance Management Cases Various civil litigation matters have been filed in state and federal courts in the U.S. and in various international jurisdictions alleging violation of consumer protection laws, fraud, computer intrusion and other causes of action related to the Company’s performance management feature used in its iPhone operating systems, introduced to certain iPhones in iOS updates 10.2.1 and 11.2. The claims seek monetary damages and other non-monetary relief. On April 5, 2018, several U.S. federal actions were consolidated through a Multidistrict Litigation process into a single action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. In addition to civil litigation, the Company is also responding to governmental investigations and requests for information relating to the performance management feature. The Company believes that its iPhones were not defective, that the performance management feature introduced with iOS updates 10.2.1 and 11.2 was intended to, and did, improve customers’ user experience, and that the Company did not make any misleading statements or fail to disclose any material information. The Company has accrued its best estimate for the ultimate resolution of these matters. Apple Inc. | Q1 2019 Form 10-Q | 21 Note 11 – Segment Information and Geographic Data The Company reports segment information based on the “management” approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company’s reportable segments. The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described in Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of the 2018 Form 10-K. The Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company’s retail stores located in those geographic locations. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the reportable segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as research and development, corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges and other separately managed general and administrative costs. The Company does not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes. The following table shows information by reportable segment for the three months ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 (in millions): Three Months Ended December 29, 2018 December 30, 2017 Americas: Net sales $ 36,940 $ 35,193 Operating income $ 11,200 $ 11,316 Europe: Net sales $ 20,363 $ 21,054 Operating income $ 6,658 $ 6,893 Greater China: Net sales $ 13,169 $ 17,956 Operating income $ 5,314 $ 6,908 Japan: Net sales $ 6,910 $ 7,237 Operating income $ 3,014 $ 3,082 Rest of Asia Pacific: Net sales $ 6,928 $ 6,853 Operating income $ 2,560 $ 2,575 Apple Inc. | Q1 2019 Form 10-Q | 22 A reconciliation of the Company’s segment operating income to the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three months ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 is as follows (in millions): Three Months Ended December 29, 2018 December 30, 2017 Segment operating income $ 28,746 $ 30,774 Research and development expense (3,902 ) (3,407 ) Other corporate expenses, net (1,498 ) (1,093 ) Total operating income $ 23,346 $ 26,274 Apple Inc. | Q1 2019 Form 10-Q | 23 Item 2.

Therefore, the Company’s strategy also includes building and expanding its own retail and online stores and its third-party distribution network to effectively reach more customers and provide them with a high-quality sales and post-sales support experience. The Company believes ongoing investment in research and development (“R&D”), marketing and advertising is critical to the development and sale of innovative products, services and technologies. Apple Inc. | Q1 2019 Form 10-Q | 24 Business Seasonality and Product Introductions The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product introductions can significantly impact product sales, product costs and operating expenses. Product introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new product inventory following a product introduction, and channel inventory of a particular product often declines as the next related major product launch approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction. However, neither historical seasonal patterns nor historical patterns of product introductions should be considered reliable indicators of the Company’s future pattern of product introductions, future net sales or financial performance. First Quarter Fiscal 2019 Highlights Total net sales decreased 5% or $4.0 billion during the first quarter of 2019 compared to the same quarter in 2018, driven by lower iPhone net sales, partially offset primarily by higher Wearables, Home and Accessories and Services net sales. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable impact on net sales during the first quarter of 2019. The Company began shipping iPhone X R in October 2018. During the first quarter of 2019, the Company introduced two new versions of iPad Pro ® as well as a new Apple Pencil ® and Smart Keyboard Folio™, all of which began shipping in November 2018. The Company also introduced a new version of MacBook Air ® and a new Mac mini ® , both of which began shipping in November 2018. The Company repurchased $8.2 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $3.6 billion during the first quarter of 2019 . Products and Services Performance Beginning in the first quarter of 2019, the Company classified the amortization of the deferred value of Maps, Siri and free iCloud services, which are bundled in the sales price of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products, in Services net sales. Historically, the Company classified the amortization of these amounts in Products net sales consistent with its management reporting framework. As a result, Products and Services net sales information for the first quarter of 2018 was reclassified to conform to the 2019 presentation. The following table shows net sales by category for the three months ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 (dollars in millions): Three Months Ended December 29, 2018 December 30, 2017 Change Net sales by category: iPhone (1) $ 51,982 $ 61,104 (15 )% Mac (1) 7,416 6,824 9 % iPad (1) 6,729 5,755 17 % Wearables, Home and Accessories (1)(2) 7,308 5,481 33 % Services (3) 10,875 9,129 19 % Total net sales $ 84,310 $ 88,293 (5 )% (1) Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are bundled in the sales price of the respective product. (2) Wearables, Home and Accessories net sales include sales of AirPods, Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats products, HomePod, iPod touch and Apple-branded and third-party accessories. (3) Services net sales include sales from Digital Content and Services, AppleCare, Apple Pay, licensing and other services. Services net sales also include amortization of the deferred value of Maps, Siri and free iCloud services, which are bundled in the sales price of certain products. iPhone iPhone net sales decreased during the first quarter of 2019 compared to the same quarter in 2018 due to lower iPhone unit sales in all the reportable geographic segments. Apple Inc. | Q1 2019 Form 10-Q | 25 Mac Mac net sales increased during the first quarter of 2019 compared to the same quarter in 2018 due primarily to higher net sales of MacBook Air. iPad iPad net sales increased during the first quarter of 2019 compared to the same quarter in 2018 due primarily to higher net sales of iPad Pro. Wearables, Home and Accessories Wearables, Home and Accessories net sales increased during the first quarter of 2019 compared to the same quarter in 2018 due primarily to higher net sales of Apple Watch and AirPods. Services Services net sales increased during the first quarter of 2019 compared to the same quarter in 2018 due primarily to licensing, the App Store and AppleCare. Segment Operating Performance The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. Further information regarding the Company’s reportable segments can be found in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 11, “Segment Information and Geographic Data.” The following table shows net sales by reportable segment for the three months ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 (dollars in millions): Three Months Ended December 29, 2018 December 30, 2017 Change Net sales by reportable segment: Americas $ 36,940 $ 35,193 5 % Europe 20,363 21,054 (3 )% Greater China 13,169 17,956 (27 )% Japan 6,910 7,237 (5 )% Rest of Asia Pacific 6,928 6,853 1 % Total net sales $ 84,310 $ 88,293 (5 )% Americas Americas net sales increased during the first quarter of 2019 compared to the same quarter in 2018 due primarily to higher Wearables, Home and Accessories and Services net sales, partially offset by lower iPhone net sales. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable impact on Americas net sales during the first quarter of 2019. Europe Europe net sales decreased during the first quarter of 2019 compared to the same quarter in 2018 due primarily to lower iPhone net sales, partially offset by higher Wearables, Home and Accessories and Services net sales. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable impact on Europe net sales during the first quarter of 2019. Greater China Greater China net sales decreased during the first quarter of 2019 compared to the same quarter in 2018 due primarily to lower iPhone net sales. Apple Inc. | Q1 2019 Form 10-Q | 26 Japan Japan net sales decreased during the first quarter of 2019 compared to the same quarter in 2018 due primarily to lower iPhone net sales, partially offset by higher Services and iPad net sales. Rest of Asia Pacific Rest of Asia Pacific net sales during the first quarter of 2019 were generally flat compared to the same quarter in 2018, as higher Wearables, Home and Accessories and Services net sales were offset by lower iPhone net sales. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable impact on Rest of Asia Pacific net sales during the first quarter of 2019. Gross Margin Products and services gross margin and gross margin percentage for the three months ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 were as follows (dollars in millions): Three Months Ended December 29, 2018 December 30, 2017 Gross margin: Products $ 25,197 $ 28,589 Services 6,834 5,323 Total gross margin $ 32,031 $ 33,912 Gross margin percentage: Products 34.3 % 36.1 % Services 62.8 % 58.3 % Total gross margin percentage 38.0 % 38.4 % Products Gross Margin Products gross margin decreased during the first quarter of 2019 compared to the same quarter in 2018 due primarily to lower iPhone unit sales and the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, partially offset by higher net sales of Mac, iPad and Wearables. Year-over-year products gross margin percentage decreased during the first quarter of 2019 due primarily to a different product mix and the impact of lower iPhone unit sales on the Company’s products fixed cost structure. Services Gross Margin Services gross margin increased during the first quarter of 2019 compared to the same quarter in 2018 due primarily to a different services mix. Year-over-year services gross margin percentage increased during the first quarter of 2019 due primarily to a favorable mix of services with higher margins and the impact of higher services net sales on the Company’s services fixed cost structure. The Company anticipates total gross margin percentage during the second quarter of 2019 to be between 37.0% and 38.0%. The foregoing statement regarding the Company’s expected total gross margin percentage in the second quarter of 2019 is forward-looking and could differ from actual results. The Company’s future gross margins can be impacted by multiple factors including, but not limited to, those set forth in Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q under the heading “Risk Factors” and those described in this paragraph. In general, the Company believes gross margins will be subject to volatility and remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in response to such pressures; increased competition; the Company’s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products; compressed product life cycles; potential increases in the cost of components and outside manufacturing services; the Company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix; fluctuations in exchange rates; and costs associated with the Company’s frequent introductions and transitions of products and services. Apple Inc. | Q1 2019 Form 10-Q | 27 Operating Expenses Operating expenses for the three months ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 were as follows (dollars in millions): Three Months Ended December 29, 2018 December 30, 2017 Research and development $ 3,902 $ 3,407 Percentage of total net sales 5 % 4 % Selling, general and administrative $ 4,783 $ 4,231 Percentage of total net sales 6 % 5 % Total operating expenses $ 8,685 $ 7,638 Percentage of total net sales 10 % 9 % Research and Development The growth in R&D expense during the first quarter of 2019 compared to the same quarter in 2018 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses and infrastructure-related costs. The Company continues to believe that focused investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace, and to the development of new and updated products and services that are central to the Company’s core business strategy. Selling, General and Administrative The growth in selling, general and administrative expense during the first quarter of 2019 compared to the same quarter in 2018 was driven primarily by increases in professional fees and headcount-related expenses. Other Income/(Expense), Net Other income/(expense), net for the three months ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 was as follows (dollars in millions): Three Months Ended December 29, 2018 December 30, 2017 Change Interest and dividend income $ 1,307 $ 1,452 Interest expense (890 ) (734 ) Other income, net 143 38 Total other income/(expense), net $ 560 $ 756 (26 )% The decrease in other income/(expense), net during the first quarter of 2019 compared to the same quarter in 2018 was due primarily to higher interest expense on debt, lower interest income and lower investment-related gains, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange–related items. The weighted-average interest rate earned by the Company on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was 2.19% and 2.11% in the first quarter of 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Apple Inc. | Q1 2019 Form 10-Q | 28 Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for the three months ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 were as follows (dollars in millions): Three Months Ended December 29, 2018 December 30, 2017 Provision for income taxes $ 3,941 $ 6,965 Effective tax rate 16.5 % 25.8 % Statutory federal income tax rate 21 % 24.5 % The Company’s effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2019 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate of 21% due primarily to the lower tax rate on foreign earnings and tax benefits from share-based compensation. The Company’s effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2019 was lower compared to the same quarter in 2018 due to higher taxes in 2018 as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”) and a lower statutory federal income tax rate in 2019, partially offset by higher taxes on foreign earnings in 2019. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Hedging In August 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities (“ASU 2017-12”). ASU 2017-12 expands component and fair value hedging, specifies the presentation of the effects of hedging instruments, and eliminates the separate measurement and presentation of hedge ineffectiveness. The Company will adopt ASU 2017-12 in its first quarter of 2020 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method and is currently evaluating the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements. Financial Instruments In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“ASU 2016-13”), which modifies the measurement of expected credit losses on certain financial instruments. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-13 in its first quarter of 2021 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. Based on the composition of the Company’s investment portfolio, current market conditions, and historical credit loss activity, the adoption of ASU 2016-13 is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. Leases In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (“ASU 2016-02”), which modifies lease accounting for lessees to increase transparency and comparability by recording lease assets and liabilities for operating leases and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-02 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method through a cumulative-effect adjustment at the beginning of its first quarter of 2020. While the Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2016-02, based on the lease portfolio as of December 29, 2018 , the Company anticipates recording lease assets and liabilities of approximately $9.1 billion on its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, with no material impact to its Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. However, the ultimate impact of adopting ASU 2016-02 will depend on the Company’s lease portfolio as of the adoption date. Apple Inc. | Q1 2019 Form 10-Q | 29 Liquidity and Capital Resources The following tables present selected financial information and statistics as of December 29, 2018 and September 29, 2018 and for the first three months of 2019 and 2018 (in millions): December 29, 2018 September 29, 2018 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities (1) $ 245,035 $ 237,100 Property, plant and equipment, net $ 39,597 $ 41,304 Commercial paper $ 11,969 $ 11,964 Total term debt $ 102,761 $ 102,519 Working capital $ 32,545 $ 15,410 Three Months Ended December 29, 2018 December 30, 2017 Cash generated by operating activities $ 26,690 $ 28,293 Cash generated by/(used in) investing activities $ 5,844 $ (13,590 ) Cash used in financing activities $ (13,676 ) $ (7,501 ) (1) As of December 29, 2018 and September 29, 2018 , total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities included $19.9 billion and $20.3 billion , respectively, that was restricted from general use, related to the State Aid Decision (refer to Note 5, “Income Taxes” in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q) and other agreements. The Company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, along with commercial paper and other short-term liquidity arrangements, will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital asset purchases, dividends, share repurchases, debt repayments and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months. In connection with the State Aid Decision, as of December 29, 2018 , the entire recovery amount of €13.1 billion plus interest of €1.2 billion was funded into escrow, where it will remain restricted from general use pending conclusion of all appeals. The Company’s marketable securities investment portfolio is primarily invested in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company’s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. During the three months ended December 29, 2018 , cash generated by operating activities of $26.7 billion was a result of $20.0 billion of net income, non-cash adjustments to net income of $5.0 billion and an increase in the net change in operating assets and liabilities of $1.8 billion . Cash generated by investing activities of $5.8 billion during the three months ended December 29, 2018 consisted primarily of proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities, net of purchases, of $9.8 billion , partially offset by cash used to acquire property, plant and equipment of $3.4 billion . Cash used in financing activities of $13.7 billion during the three months ended December 29, 2018 consisted primarily of cash used to repurchase common stock of $8.8 billion and cash used to pay dividends and dividend equivalents of $3.6 billion . During the three months ended December 30, 2017 , cash generated by operating activities of $28.3 billion was a result of $20.1 billion of net income and an increase in the net change in operating assets and liabilities of $37.9 billion , partially offset by non-cash adjustments to net income of $29.7 billion . Cash used in investing activities of $13.6 billion during the three months ended December 30, 2017 consisted primarily of cash used for purchases of marketable securities, net of sales and maturities, of $10.4 billion and cash used to acquire property, plant and equipment of $2.8 billion . Cash used in financing activities of $7.5 billion during the three months ended December 30, 2017 consisted primarily of cash used to repurchase common stock of $10.1 billion and cash used to pay dividends and dividend equivalents of $3.3 billion , partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of term debt, net of $7.0 billion . Capital Assets The Company’s capital expenditures were $1.5 billion during the first three months of 2019 . The Company anticipates utilizing approximately $12.0 billion for capital expenditures during 2019 , which includes product tooling and manufacturing process equipment; data centers; corporate facilities and infrastructure, including information systems hardware, software and enhancements; and retail store facilities. Apple Inc. | Q1 2019 Form 10-Q | 30 Debt The Company issues unsecured short-term promissory notes (“Commercial Paper”) pursuant to a commercial paper program. The Company uses the net proceeds from the commercial paper program for general corporate purposes, including dividends and share repurchases. As of December 29, 2018 , the Company had $12.0 billion of Commercial Paper outstanding, with a weighted-average interest rate of 2.39% and maturities generally less than nine months . As of December 29, 2018 , the Company had outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $103.8 billion (collectively the “Notes”). The Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on the Notes. In addition, the Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into foreign currency swaps to manage foreign currency risk on the Notes. Further information regarding the Company’s debt issuances and related hedging activity can be found in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 3, “Financial Instruments” and Note 6, “Debt.” Capital Return Program On May 1, 2018, the Company announced the Board of Directors had authorized a program to repurchase up to $100 billion of the Company’s common stock, of which $37.3 billion had been utilized as of December 29, 2018 . During the three months ended December 29, 2018 , the Company repurchased 38.0 million shares of its common stock for $8.2 billion . The Company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. Under this program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act. On May 1, 2018, the Company also announced the Board of Directors raised the Company’s quarterly cash dividend from $0.63 to $0.73 per share, beginning with the dividend paid during the third quarter of 2018. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. Contractual Obligations Operating Leases As of December 29, 2018 , the Company’s total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases were $9.9 billion . The Company’s retail store and other facility leases typically have original terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multi-year renewal options. Manufacturing Purchase Obligations The Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture sub-assemblies for the Company’s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. These outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days . The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. As of December 29, 2018 , the Company expects to pay $30.2 billion under manufacturing-related supplier arrangements, which are primarily noncancelable. Other Purchase Obligations The Company’s other purchase obligations consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and noncancelable obligations related to advertising, licensing, R&D, internet and telecommunications services, content creation and other activities. As of December 29, 2018 , the Company had other purchase obligations of $6.3 billion. Other Non-Current Liabilities As of December 29, 2018 , a significant portion of the other non-current liabilities in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet consisted of the $30.9 billion deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the Act. The Company plans to pay the deemed repatriation tax payable in installments in accordance with the Act. The Company’s remaining other non-current liabilities primarily consist of items for which the Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments. Apple Inc. | Q1 2019 Form 10-Q | 31 Indemnification Agreements entered into by the Company may include indemnification provisions, which may subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. Except as disclosed in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, “Commitments and Contingencies” under the heading “Contingencies,” in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to indemnification of third parties. The Company offers an iPhone Upgrade Program, which is available to customers who purchase a qualifying iPhone in the U.S., the U.K. and mainland China. The iPhone Upgrade Program provides customers the right to trade in that iPhone for a specified amount when purchasing a new iPhone, provided certain conditions are met. The Company accounts for the trade-in right as a guarantee liability and recognizes arrangement revenue net of the fair value of such right, with subsequent changes to the guarantee liability recognized within net sales. The Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers. Under these agreements, the Company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers of the Company, and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim. While the Company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates, and such differences may be material. Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of the 2018 Form 10-K, and “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in Part II, Item 7 of the 2018 Form 10-K describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements. With the exception of Revenue Recognition and Impairment of Marketable Debt Securities, there have been no material changes to the Company’s critical accounting policies and estimates since the 2018 Form 10-K. Revenue Recognition The Company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud, Siri and Maps. The third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (“SSP”). Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company’s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided. The Company’s process for determining estimated SSPs involves management’s judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. Should future facts and circumstances change, the Company’s SSPs and the future rate of related amortization for unspecified software upgrades and services related to future sales of these devices could change. Factors subject to change include the nature of the unspecified software upgrade rights and product-related bundled services offered, their estimated value and the estimated period they are expected to be provided. Apple Inc. | Q1 2019 Form 10-Q | 32 Impairment of Marketable Debt Securities The Company’s investments in marketable debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value. The Company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine if any security is other-than-temporarily impaired, which would require the Company to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made. In making this determination, the Company evaluates, among other things, the duration and extent to which the fair value of a security is less than its cost; the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto; and the Company’s intent to sell, or whether it will more likely than not be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. The Company’s assessment of whether an available-for-sale debt security is other-than-temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular security, which would have an adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk There have been no material changes to the Company’s market risk during the first three months of 2019 . For a discussion of the Company’s exposure to market risk, refer to the Company’s market risk disclosures set forth in Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” of the 2018 Form 10-K. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act were effective as of December 29, 2018 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the first quarter of 2019 , which were identified in connection with management’s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Apple Inc. | Q1 2019 Form 10-Q | 33 PART II — OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings The Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. Except as described in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, “Commitments and Contingencies” under the heading “Contingencies,” in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Refer to the risk factor “ The Company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings, such as being found to have infringed on intellectual property rights ” in Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q under the heading “Risk Factors.” The Company settled certain matters during the first quarter of 2019 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating results. Item 1A. Risk Factors The following description of risk factors includes any material changes to, and supersedes the description of, risk factors associated with the Company’s business previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of the 2018 Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.” The business, financial condition and operating results of the Company can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described below, any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly, cause the Company’s actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from past, or from anticipated future, financial condition and operating results. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, operating results and stock price. The following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. These risk factors may be important to understanding other statements in this Form 10-Q. The following information should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part I, Item 1, “Financial Statements” and Part I, Item 2, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Form 10-Q. Because of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company’s financial condition and operating results, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. Global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and growth . The Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’s total net sales. In addition, a majority of the Company’s supply chain, and its manufacturing and assembly activities, are located outside the U.S. As a result, the Company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions. Adverse macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, slower growth or recession, new or increased tariffs, changes to fiscal and monetary policy, tighter credit, higher interest rates, high unemployment and currency fluctuations could materially adversely affect demand for the Company’s products and services. In addition, consumer confidence and spending could be adversely affected in response to financial market volatility, negative financial news, conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets, declines in income or asset values, changes to fuel and other energy costs, labor and healthcare costs and other economic factors. In addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company’s products, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic conditions could have a significant impact on the Company’s suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners. Potential effects include financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance operations and purchases of the Company’s products; and insolvency. A downturn in the economic environment could also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company’s trade receivables; the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the Company’s ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair value of the Company’s financial instruments. These and other economic factors could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and growth. Apple Inc. | Q1 2019 Form 10-Q | 34 Global markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets. The Company’s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price/performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. The Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in R&D. There can be no assurance that these investments will achieve expected returns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully. The Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to register, numerous patents, trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and emulating the Company’s products and infringing on its intellectual property. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the Company’s intellectual property, the Company’s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be adversely affected. The Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, tablet and personal computer markets. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors may have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. Additionally, the Company faces significant competition as competitors attempt to imitate the Company’s product features and applications within their own products or, alternatively, collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the Company’s approach to providing components seamlessly within their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions. Some of the markets in which the Company competes, including the market for personal computers, have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted. In addition, an increasing number of internet-enabled devices that include software applications and are smaller, simpler and cheaper than traditional personal computers compete with some of the Company’s existing products. The Company’s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company’s financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the Company’s ability to continually improve its products and services in order to maintain their functional and design advantages. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively. To remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services. Due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services. The success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors including, but not limited to, timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company’s ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for new products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies. Accordingly, the Company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product and service introductions and transitions. Apple Inc. | Q1 2019 Form 10-Q | 35 The Company depends on the performance of carriers, wholesalers, retailers and other resellers. The Company distributes its products through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers, many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers. The Company also sells its products and third-party products in most of its major markets directly to education, enterprise and government customers and consumers and small and mid-sized businesses through its retail and online stores. Some carriers providing cellular network service for iPhone offer financing, installment payment plans or subsidies for users’ purchases of the device. There is no assurance that such offers will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the Company’s agreements with these carriers or in agreements the Company enters into with new carriers. The Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers’ stores with Company employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays. These programs could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental sales. The financial condition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Company’s products, or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the Company’s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company’s products. The Company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk. The Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers’ facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable, no assurance can be given that the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes. The Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. Manufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company’s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for periods up to 150 days . Because the Company’s markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments. Future operating results depend upon the Company’s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms. Because the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that could materially adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and operating results. While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms. The effects of global or regional economic conditions on the Company’s suppliers, described in “ Global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and growth ” above, also could affect the Company’s ability to obtain components . Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results. The Company’s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements. If the Company’s supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company’s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. The Company’s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Apple Inc. | Q1 2019 Form 10-Q | 36 The Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of which are located outside of the U.S. Substantially all of the Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia. A significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements may lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company’s direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished control may have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products or services, or the Company’s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, the Company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect or warranty liability. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, material violations of the supplier code of conduct could occur. The Company relies on single-sourced outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many components, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company’s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform may have a negative impact on the Company’s cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations may be disrupted for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, military actions, economic, business, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, or international trade disputes. The Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply could be reduced or terminated and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments could be negatively impacted. The Company’s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the Company’s business and result in harm to the Company’s reputation. The Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the Company, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products. Defects may also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects could make the Company’s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the Company’s products are introduced into specialized applications, including healthcare. In addition, the Company’s service offerings may have quality issues and from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, the Company’s services may not perform as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software and services it offers. Failure to do so could result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the Company’s products and services. In addition, the Company may be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property, plant and equipment, and/or intangible assets, and significant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems could also adversely affect the experience for users of the Company’s products and services, and result in harm to the Company’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and services introductions and lost sales. The Company relies on access to third-party digital content, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell currently available music, movies, TV shows and books. The licensing or other distribution arrangements with these third parties are for relatively short terms and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on reasonable terms, if at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content in the future. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company’s access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules, or continue to expand its geographic reach. Failure to obtain the right to make third-party digital content available, or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results. Some third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. If requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There is no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner. In addition, certain countries have passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force the Company to license its digital rights management, which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could negatively affect arrangements with the Company’s content providers. Apple Inc. | Q1 2019 Form 10-Q | 37 The Company’s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers. The Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications and services. There is no assurance that third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the Company’s products. If third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company’s products, customers may choose not to buy the Company’s products. The Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers’ perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the Company’s products compared to competitors’ platforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets and Windows for personal computers. This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of product sales and the costs of developing such applications and services. The Company’s minority market share in the global smartphone, tablet and personal computer markets could make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company’s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors’ products with larger market share. If developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company’s devices may suffer. The Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products. The Company’s products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and if third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, third-party applications might not take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences or might not operate correctly and may result in dissatisfied customers. The Company sells and delivers third-party applications for its products through the App Store, Mac App Store and TV App Store. The Company retains a commission from sales through these platforms. If developers reduce their use of these platforms to distribute their applications and offer in-app purchases to customers, then the volume of sales, and the commission that the Company earns on those sales, would decrease. The Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Many of the Company’s products include third-party intellectual property, which requires licenses from those third parties. Based on past experience and industry practice, the Company believes such licenses generally can be obtained on reasonable terms. There is, however, no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, could preclude the Company from selling certain products or services, or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results. The Company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings, such as being found to have infringed on intellectual property rights . The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved, and new claims may arise in the future. In addition, agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which may subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. Claims against the Company based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights have generally increased over time and may continue to increase. In particular, the Company has historically faced a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled products, and new claims may arise in the future. For example, technology and other patent-holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in a number of U.S. jurisdictions and before the U.S. International Trade Commission, as well as internationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages. Regardless of the merit of particular claims, litigation may be expensive, time consuming, disruptive to the Company’s operations and distracting to management. In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into licensing agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such disputes. No assurance can be given that such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These agreements may also significantly increase the Company’s cost of sales and operating expenses. Apple Inc. | Q1 2019 Form 10-Q | 38 Except as described in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, “Commitments and Contingencies” under the heading “Contingencies,” in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims, including matters related to infringement of intellectual property rights. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome could result in significant compensatory, punitive or trebled monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results. While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise. The Company is subject to laws and regulations worldwide, changes to which could increase the Company’s costs and individually or in the aggregate adversely affect the Company’s business. The Company is subject to laws and regulations affecting its domestic and international operations in a number of areas. These U.S. and foreign laws and regulations affect the Company’s activities in areas including, but not limited to, labor, advertising, digital content, consumer protection, real estate, billing, e-commerce, promotions, quality of services, telecommunications, mobile communications and media, television, intellectual property ownership and infringement, tax, import and export requirements, anti-corruption, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy and data localization requirements, anti-competition, environmental, health and safety. By way of example, laws and regulations related to mobile communications and media devices in the many jurisdictions in which the Company operates are extensive and subject to change. Such changes could include, among others, restrictions on the production, manufacture, distribution and use of devices, locking devices to a carrier’s network, or mandating the use of devices on more than one carrier’s network. These devices are also subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies, as well as by cellular network carriers for use on their networks. These certification processes are extensive and time consuming, and could result in additional testing requirements, product modifications, or delays in product shipment dates, or could preclude the Company from selling certain products. Compliance with these laws, regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive, and they may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, further increasing the cost of compliance and doing business. Any such costs, which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation, could individually or in the aggregate make the Company’s products and services less attractive to the Company’s customers, delay the introduction of new products in one or more regions, or cause the Company to change or limit its business practices. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that the Company’s employees, contractors, or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company’s policies and procedures. The Company’s business is subject to the risks of international operations. The Company derives a majority of its net sales and earnings from its international operations. Compliance with applicable U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, such as import and export requirements, anti-corruption laws, tax laws, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy and data localization requirements, environmental laws, labor laws and anti-competition regulations, increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. Although the Company has implemented policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations, a violation by the Company’s employees, contractors or agents could nevertheless occur. In some cases, compliance with the laws and regulations of one country could violate the laws and regulations of another country. Violations of these laws and regulations could materially adversely affect the Company’s brand, international growth efforts and business. The Company also could be significantly affected by other risks associated with international activities including, but not limited to, economic and labor conditions, increased duties, taxes and other costs, political instability and international trade disputes. Gross margins on the Company’s products in foreign countries, and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, could be materially adversely affected by international trade regulations, including duties, tariffs and antidumping penalties. The Company is also exposed to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables with customers in certain international markets. There can be no assurance the Company can effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses. Apple Inc. | Q1 2019 Form 10-Q | 39 The Company’s retail stores have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. The Company’s retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory and personnel. The Company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space. Certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than the Company’s more typical retail stores. Due to the high cost structure associated with the Company’s retail stores, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance costs. The Company’s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the Company’s financial condition and operating results, including macro-economic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity. Other factors include, but are not limited to, the Company’s ability to manage costs associated with retail store construction and operation; manage relationships with existing retail partners; manage costs associated with fluctuations in the value of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost. Investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company’s ongoing business and present risks not originally contemplated. The Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater than expected liabilities and expenses, inadequate return of capital and unidentified issues not discovered in the Company’s due diligence. These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful. The Company’s business and reputation may be impacted by information technology system failures or network disruptions. The Company may be subject to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, or other events or disruptions. System redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company’s business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions could adversely impact the Company’s business by, among other things, preventing access to the Company’s online services, interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the Company’s products. These events could materially adversely affect the Company’s reputation, financial condition and operating results. There may be losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personally identifiable information, that could subject the Company to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences. The Company’s business requires it to use and store confidential information including, among other things, personally identifiable information (“PII”) with respect to the Company’s customers and employees. The Company devotes significant resources to network and data security, including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data. But these measures cannot provide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the Company’s reputation, financial condition and operating results. The Company’s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties. Although the Company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to third parties, such measures are not always effective and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the Company’s reputation, financial condition and operating results. For example, the Company may experience a security breach impacting the Company’s information technology systems that compromises the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential information. Such an incident could, among other things, impair the Company’s ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services, impact the Company’s stock price, materially damage supplier relationships, and expose the Company to litigation or government investigations, which could result in penalties, fines or judgments against the Company. Although malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information, including PII, affect many companies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and processes. Apple Inc. | Q1 2019 Form 10-Q | 40 The Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data, including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies. As with all companies, these security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty password management or other irregularities. For example, third parties attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names, passwords or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access the Company’s information technology systems. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, may result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the Company’s products and services. In addition to the risks relating to general confidential information described above, the Company may also be subject to specific obligations relating to health data and payment card data. Health data may be subject to additional privacy, security and breach notification requirements, and the Company may be subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the Company’s compliance with these obligations. If the Company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements, or if health data is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the Company’s agreements with healthcare institutions, the Company could be subject to litigation or government investigations, may be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and could also incur significant fees or fines. Under payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder information is potentially compromised, the Company could be liable for associated investigatory expenses and could also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards. The Company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards, which would materially adversely affect the Company’s reputation, financial condition and operating results. While the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise. The Company’s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding data protection. The Company is subject to federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of PII. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also may restrict transfers of PII among the Company and its international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the Company to incur substantial costs or require the Company to change its business practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability. The Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of PII through its privacy policy, information provided on its website and press statements. Any failure by the Company to comply with these public statements or with other federal, state or international privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. In addition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability. The Company’s success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key personnel. Much of the Company’s future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly skilled employees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley, where most of the Company’s key personnel are located. The Company’s business may be impacted by political events, international trade disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions. Political events, international trade disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions could harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners. International trade disputes could result in tariffs and other protectionist measures that could adversely affect the Company’s business. Tariffs could increase the cost of the Company’s products and the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs could adversely impact the gross margin that the Company earns on its products. Tariffs could also make the Company’s products more expensive for customers, which could make the Company’s products less competitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also adopt other protectionist measures that could limit the Company’s ability to offer its products and services. Political uncertainty surrounding international trade disputes and protectionist measures could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company’s business. Apple Inc. | Q1 2019 Form 10-Q | 41 Many of the Company’s operations and facilities as well as critical business operations of the Company’s suppliers and contract manufacturers are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, labor disputes, public health issues and other events beyond the Company’s control. Global climate change could result in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Such events could make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company’s supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company’s service offerings. Following an interruption to its business, the Company could require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures in order to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company. The Company’s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While the Company’s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in disruption to the Company’s business and harm to the Company’s reputation. Should major public health issues, including pandemics, arise, the Company could be adversely affected by more stringent employee travel restrictions, additional limitations in freight services, governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions, delays in production ramps of new products and disruptions in the operations of the Company’s suppliers and contract manufacturers. The Company expects its quarterly net sales and operating results to fluctuate. The Company’s profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For example, gross margins on the Company’s hardware products vary across product lines and can change over time as a result of product transitions, pricing and configuration changes, and component, warranty and other cost fluctuations. The Company’s financial results may be materially adversely impacted as a result of shifts in the mix of products and services that the Company sells; shifts in the geographic, currency or channel mix of the Company’s sales; component cost increases; price competition; or the introduction of new products, including new products with higher cost structures. The Company has typically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product introductions can significantly impact net sales, product costs and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a majority of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company’s products, issues with new product introductions, information technology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company’s logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners. The Company’s stock price is subject to volatility. The Company’s stock price has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, the Company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies’ operating performance. Price volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its own stock to exceed the stock’s price at a given point in time. The Company believes its stock price should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability. The Company also believes its stock price should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow, and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Company’s Board of Directors, and the Company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, its stock price may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention. The Company’s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies. The Company’s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non–U.S. dollar–denominated sales, cost of sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company’s products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company’s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar’s strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency–denominated sales. Apple Inc. | Q1 2019 Form 10-Q | 42 Conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Company’s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins. The Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place. The Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio. The Company’s investments can be negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and economic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results. The Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen. The Company distributes its products through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. The Company also sells its products directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the Company’s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance. The Company’s exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of December 29, 2018 , a significant portion of the Company’s trade receivables was concentrated within cellular network carriers, and its vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses. The Company could be subject to changes in its tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. The Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland, where a number of the Company’s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. The Company’s effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including in the U.S. and Ireland. The Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company’s effective tax rates were to increase, particularly in the U.S. or Ireland, or if the ultimate determination of the Company’s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company’s financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.
