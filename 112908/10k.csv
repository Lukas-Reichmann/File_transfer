B USINESS General Overview Skyline Champion Corporation, an Indiana corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries are referred to herein as ""Skyline Champion,"" ""us,"" ""we,"" ""our,"" the ""Company,"" and any other similar terms, unless otherwise indicated in this Annual Report. We are a leading producer of factory-built housing in North America with net sales for the year ended April 1, 2023 (“fiscal 2023”) of approximately $2.6 billion. We have more than 70 years of homebuilding experience, approximately 7,700 employees and 43 manufacturing facilities located in 19 states across the United States and three provinces in western Canada. We offer a leading portfolio of manufactured and modular homes, park model RVs, accessory dwelling units (“ADUs”) and modular buildings for the multi-family and hospitality sectors. Our facilities are strategically located to serve strong regions in the United States and western Canada. We operated 19 manufacturing facilities in the top ten states with the highest number of manufactured homes shipped in fiscal 2023, as well as 18 manufacturing facilities in the ten states with the greatest growth in the number of manufactured homes shipped in the last ten years. We believe that we maintained the following leading positions in the factory-built housing industry in the United States and western Canada (based on units) in calendar year 2022: We believe our leading positions are driven by our comprehensive product offering, strong brand reputation, broad manufacturing footprint, and our complementary retail, construction services, and logistics businesses. Our market share in the United States total housing market is approximately 2.4%. We design and build a range of manufactured and modular homes, park model RVs, ADUs, and commercial structures. We believe that the high quality and broad scope of our product and service offerings provide us a competitive advantage relative to other factory-built and certain site-built homes. With our award-winning product designs, we seek to meet the needs of our localized customers, while also providing them with an array of pre-designed options. Our leading brands are marketed and distributed through a network of independent and company-owned retailers, community operators, government agencies, and builder/developers. We build homes under some of the most well-known brand names in the factory-built housing industry including Skyline Homes, Champion Home Builders, Genesis Homes, Athens Park Models, Dutch Housing, Atlantic Homes, Excel Homes, Homes of Merit, New Era, Redman Homes, ScotBilt Homes, Shore Park, Silvercrest, and Titan Homes in the U.S., and Moduline and SRI Homes in western Canada. In addition to our core home building business, we provide construction services to install and set-up factory-built homes; we operate a factory-direct manufactured home retail business, marketed under the Titan Factory Direct and Champion Homes Center brands, with 31 sales centers spanning the United States; and we operate Star Fleet Trucking, which provides transportation services to the manufactured housing and other industries from several dispatch locations across the United States. 4 Our principal executive offices are located at 755 West Big Beaver Road, Suite 1000, Troy, Michigan 48084. Our website is located at www.skylinechampion.com. Our website and the information contained on our website is not incorporated by reference and is not a part of this Annual Report. We make available on our website, as soon as reasonably practicable, all of the reports required to be filed with the SEC. Our SEC filings are also available to the public on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. Business Strategy We will continue to pursue opportunities to grow our revenue and earnings by constructing quality-built, sustainable, and innovatively designed homes and other modular structures in an environmentally friendly factory setting. In connection with executing this business strategy, we are focused on the following four initiatives: Increasing the Operating Capacity and Profitability of our Existing Facilities We are currently focused on a number of ongoing operational initiatives to further enhance our operating margins and increase production capacity including: Investing in our Customers’ Digital Experience The Company continues to invest in the design and testing of an enhanced digital customer experience. We are piloting an end-to-end platform where consumers can shop, design, configure, and price their homes online, which we believe will further drive revenue growth for Skyline Champion and our channel partners. We are experiencing tremendous online interest from consumers and believe a digital platform to customize and purchase homes will continue to grow. Implementing Production Automation and Enterprise-wide Digital Technology Continuing a Balanced Organic and Acquisition-Based Growth Strategy The Company continues to focus on growing in strong markets through a combination of business acquisitions and plant start-ups. In July 2022, we acquired 12 Factory Expo retail sales centers from Alta Cima Corporation, which expanded our internal retail network across a broader portion of the U.S. In May 2022, we acquired Manis Custom Builders, Inc. (""Manis""), which operated a manufacturing facility and retail sales center in North Carolina, in order to expand our manufacturing footprint and further streamline our product offerings in the southeast region. In February 2021, we acquired ScotBilt Homes, LLC and related companies from SHI Group Holdings, Inc. (collectively, “ScotBilt”). ScotBilt operated two manufacturing facilities in Georgia providing affordable housing throughout Alabama, Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas. The acquisition complemented our existing manufacturing footprint in the attractive mid-south region. We are also focused on streamlining our U.S. manufacturing production capacity through various plant start-ups. In June 2021, we acquired two idle facilities in Navasota, Texas in order to increase our production capabilities in the Texas market, and began production at one of these facilities in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. In January 2021, we purchased two idled manufacturing facilities in Pembroke, North Carolina, one of the strongest growth states in the U.S., and began production at one of these facilities in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. We are also in the process of opening previously idled facilities in Bartow, Florida and Decatur, Indiana, both of which are expecting to begin production in fiscal 2024. 5 We have demonstrated our ability to broaden our manufacturing and retail presence through the successful execution of a balanced organic growth and acquisition-based strategy. As demand for affordable housing grows, we will continue to execute on this growth strategy. We believe our idle manufacturing plants provide us with the ability to grow with demand over the longer term. We also continue to explore opportunities to acquire value-enhancing retail locations, manufacturing facilities, and factory-built housing competitors to supplement our organic growth initiatives. We have a proven track-record of executing and integrating acquisitions. Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) We demonstrate our commitment to ESG through company-wide and plant-specific programs and through our everyday business practices when providing high-quality, yet affordable homes to U.S. and Canadian homebuyers. Manufactured and modular homes cost up to 50% less per square foot than conventional site-built homes, expanding the opportunity for individuals to own a home despite an ever-growing housing affordability gap. The Board of Directors has formal responsibility for the oversight and integration of all of the Company’s sustainability programs and policies, and the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, and Nominating and Governance Committee have lead responsibility for the Company’s strategy, policies and practices with respect to environmental sustainability, social and human capital matters, and governance, respectively. Our five ESG tenets include: (1) Environmental Focus, (2) Health & Safety, (3) Human Capital, (4) Community Outreach, and (5) Governance. Skyline Champion manages its operations to minimize resource consumption and environmental impacts. We continue to identify opportunities to reduce our environmental impact across our operations by reducing raw material waste, designing and constructing energy efficient homes, conserving our natural resources through recycling programs and reducing our carbon footprint by producing our homes in factories close to where our customers and employees live. Many of our U.S. manufacturing facilities are certified to produce Energy Star® energy efficient rated homes through a special EPA program for manufactured housing. Environmental sustainability is at the forefront of what we do every day. We construct manufactured homes in controlled environments. Our efficient construction process results in less energy usage and material waste compared to traditional site-built construction. In many of our plants, we have transitioned to LED lighting, and we recycle insulation material, lumber, metals, plastics, paper and many other products. In the course of executing our expansion plans, we have repurposed older buildings, both revitalizing the local community and preserving vacant land. This reduces the need for new building materials and extensive deployment of construction equipment, and thus reduces carbon emissions. We participate in a reforestation program with Arbor Day Foundation. With forestry products central to the construction of homes, we participate in a program to plant one tree for every tree used in construction of our homes. Reforestation contributes to the environment by replenishing forests, reducing greenhouses gases (""GHG"") emissions, and protecting local watersheds. As a nationwide provider of affordable housing, we have a social responsibility to not only the buyers of our homes, our retail and community customers and our employees, but also to the communities in which they live and work. Many of our manufacturing facilities participate locally to support programs such as Habitat for Humanity and other local charities as well as work-study programs with local community colleges and high schools. Skyline Champion is committed to ensuring sound corporate governance. We strive to maintain strong governance practices that protect and enhance accountability for the benefit of Skyline Champion, its shareholders, customers, employees and other business stakeholders. We regularly review and refine our governance practices and policies to align with evolving issues. Our internal risk management team oversees compliance with applicable laws and regulations and coordinates with subject matter experts throughout the business to identify, monitor and mitigate risk including information security risk management and cyber defense programs. Skyline Champion’s Corporate Governance Guidelines, the charters of committees of our Board and our Code of Conduct can be found in the Governance Documents section under the Governance tab on our website at www.skylinechampion.com. Additional information on our Corporate Governance policies can be found in our Proxy Statement filed with the SEC. 6 Human Capital and Diversity The Skyline Champion team manages the business in accordance with the Company’s Core Operating Principles: We appreciate each member of the Skyline Champion team and the unique skills and diversity of thought that each employee contributes to the overall success of the Company. We strive for an inclusive environment and reward individual contributions that foster innovative ideas for improving our products and workplace. We do not tolerate discrimination or harassment of any kind including but not limited to discrimination or harassment on the basis of gender identity, race, religion, age or disabilities. We are committed to the development of our employees. The Company follows standard onboarding and training protocols for our direct labor team members and also offers management and OSHA training for our supervisors. We are committed to improving employee engagement and reducing turnover through these onboarding, training and mentoring activities. Depending on availability, our plants participate in local outreach programs and hire disadvantaged members of the local community. We have built a diverse team with a wide range of experiences. As of April 1, 2023, we employed approximately 7,700 full and part time employees. Our human capital resource objectives include identifying, recruiting, training, retaining and incentivizing our employees. We are proud of the strong relationship we maintain with our employees and seek to support them through a competitive compensation package and comprehensive suite of benefits. As of April 1, 2023, our manufacturing facilities in Canada employed approximately 750 workers of which the majority belong to trade associations that operate under collective bargaining agreements. There are five collective bargaining agreements (one for each Canadian manufacturing facility) and each has separate expiration dates. The agreements are set to expire at various dates between November 2023 and December 2025. We are committed to conducting our business with integrity and in compliance with all applicable laws of the cities, states and countries in which we operate. We have adopted a written Code of Conduct and Ethics and in fiscal 2022 implemented a new company wide training program to assist employees in this regard. We encourage employees to report concerns through a variety of channels, including a compliance and ethics line which allows for anonymous reporting. All reports are investigated and resolved. We also maintain an anti-retaliation policy such that any employee who reports a concern in good faith is protected from harassment, retaliation or adverse employment consequences. We take the health and safety of our employees seriously. We provide a variety of Company sponsored healthcare programs, including health, dental, and vision, that allow employees to manage their and their family's health and wellbeing. We expect each employee to follow our safety standards and protocols. Our corporate Environmental Health and Safety (“EHS”) team works to benchmark and implement EHS best practices at our plants. Each of our locations performs regular safety audits to ensure that proper safety policies are in place and appropriate safety training is provided. In addition to training and development, we measure and report monthly safety metrics and regularly review our safety performance with our Board of Directors. Factory-Built Housing A majority of our manufactured products are constructed in accordance with the regulations and rules of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) and the National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974, as amended (""HUD code""). We produce a broad range of manufactured and modular homes under a variety of brand names and in a variety of floor plans and price ranges. While most of the homes we build are single-family, multi-section, ranch-style homes, we also build two-story and single-section homes, as well as multi-family units such as town homes, apartments, duplexes, and triplexes. The single-family homes that we manufacture generally range in size from 400 to 4,000 square feet and typically include two to four bedrooms, a living room or family room, a dining room, a kitchen and typically two full bathrooms. We also build park model RVs for resorts and campgrounds, ADUs for backyard or recreational living, and commercial modular structures. We regularly introduce homes with new floor plans, exterior designs and elevations, decors and features. Our corporate architecture, marketing, and engineering departments work with our manufacturing facilities to design homes that appeal to consumers’ changing tastes at appropriate price points for their respective markets. We design and build homes with a traditional residential or site-built appearance through the use of, among other features, dormers and higher pitched roofs. We offer our Genesis brand of homes which have features similar to site-built home amenities such as porches and garages. These homes are designed to be 7 eligible for financing programs with terms similar to traditional mortgages. We are also very active in the design and construction of energy-efficient homes. The components and products used in factory-built housing are generally of the same quality as those used by other homebuilders, including conventional site-builders. The primary components include lumber, plywood, OSB, drywall, steel, floor coverings, insulation, exterior siding (vinyl, composites, wood and metal), doors, windows, shingles, kitchen appliances, furnaces, plumbing and electrical fixtures and hardware. These components are presently available from a variety of sources and we are not dependent upon any single supplier. Prices of certain materials such as lumber, insulation, steel, and drywall can fluctuate significantly due to changes in demand and supply. We endeavor to mitigate the impact of supply chain challenges through sourcing alternative materials, where appropriate, and exploring alternative supply options. We generally have been able to pass higher material costs on to customers in the form of surcharges and price increases, although that ability fluctuates over time and by market depending on demand trends. Typically, a one to three-week supply of raw materials is maintained, but supply chain volatility has caused our manufacturing operations to increase the amount of frequently used raw materials on hand versus what is typically carried. Most completed factory-built homes have components consistent with conventional site-builders, such as cabinets, wall and floor coverings, appliances, and electrical, heating and plumbing systems. Optional factory installed features include fireplaces, dormers, entertainment centers and skylights. Upon completion of the home at the factory, homes sold to retailers are transported to a retail sales center or directly to the home site. Homes sold to builders and developers are generally transported directly to the home site. At the home site, the home is placed on a foundation or otherwise affixed to the property and readied for occupancy, either by our employee set crews or third-party contractors. The sections (also referred to as floors) of a multi-section home are joined and the interior and exterior seams are finished at the home site. The consumer purchase of the home may also include retailer or contractor supplied items such as additional appliances, air conditioning, furniture, porches, decks, and garages. We construct homes in indoor facilities using an assembly-line process employing approximately 100 to 200 production employees at each facility. Factory-built HUD code homes are constructed in one or more sections affixed to a steel support frame that allows the sections to be moved through the assembly line and transported upon sale. The sections of many of the modular homes we produce are built on wooden floor systems and transported on carriers that are removed upon placement of the home at the home site. Each section or floor is assembled in stages, beginning with the construction of the frame and the floor, then adding the walls, ceiling and roof assembly, and other constructed and purchased components, and ending with a final quality control inspection. The efficiency of the assembly-line process, protection from the weather, and favorable pricing of materials resulting from our substantial purchasing power enables us to produce homes more quickly, with less material waste and often at a lower cost than a conventional site-built home of similar quality. The production schedules of our homebuilding facilities are based upon customer orders. Orders are generally subject to cancellation at any time up to the commencement of production without penalty and are not necessarily an indication of future business. Retailers place orders for retail stocking (inventory) purposes and for homebuyer orders. Before scheduling homes for production, orders and availability of financing are confirmed with our customer and, where applicable, their customer's lender. Because we produce homes to fulfill wholesale orders, our factories generally do not carry finished goods inventories, except for homes awaiting delivery. We manage our production levels, capacity and workforce size based upon current market demands. Historically, orders were generally filled within 90 days of receipt; however, delivery times were extended in the previous two years due to the increase in our sales backlog caused by strong demand for affordable housing. In fiscal 2023, our order volume decreased and material supply improved. As a result, we were able to make significant progress to reduce delivery times back to historic levels. At April 1, 2023, we had a manufacturing backlog of home orders with wholesale sales value of approximately $308.1 million. After production of a particular home has commenced, the order becomes noncancelable and the customer is obligated to take delivery of the home. Although factory-built homes can be produced throughout the year in indoor facilities, demand for homes is usually affected by inclement weather and by the cold winter months in northern areas of the U.S. and in Canada. Charges to transport homes increase with the distance from the factory to the retailer or home site. As a result, most of the retailers and builders/developers we sell to are located within a 500-mile radius of our manufacturing plants. In addition to our traditional channels of distribution, we are one of a limited number of manufactured homebuilders that have been approved for contracts with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (“FEMA”) and have historically provided housing assistance requirements following natural disasters and other housing emergencies. On February 7, 2022, we received a Delivery Disaster Relief Order from FEMA for approximately $200 million in revenue which was completed in the first half of fiscal 2023. We offer a wide selection of manufactured and modular homes as well as park model RVs at company-owned retail locations marketed under the Titan Factory Direct and Champion Homes Center brands. We maintain our company-owned retail presence through 31 retail sales centers across the U.S. Our captive retail distribution enhances the reach of our factory-built housing products directly to the homebuyers. Each of our full-service retail sales centers has a sales office and a variety of model homes of various sizes, floor plans, features, and prices that are displayed in a residential setting with sidewalks and landscaping. Customers may purchase a home from an inventory of homes maintained at the location, including a model home, or may order a home that will be built to their specifications. 8 Our retail organization provides industry leadership with the expertise to be responsive to local economic conditions and ultimately provide affordable homes to value-conscious homebuyers. During fiscal 2023, the average selling price of our factory-built homes in the U.S. was $97,500 and in Canada was $122,900. Manufactured home wholesale prices ranged from $20,000 to over $350,000. Retail sales prices of the homes, without land, generally ranged from $50,000 to over $350,000, depending upon size, floor plan, features, and options. Logistics We operate a logistics business, Star Fleet Trucking, specializing in the transportation of manufactured homes and recreational vehicles from manufacturing facilities to retailers. Star Fleet’s delivery logistics are coordinated through dispatch terminals located throughout the U.S. Star Fleet has strong relationships with its customer base, which includes some of the largest manufactured housing companies (including our own factory-built housing operations), and recreational vehicle manufacturers in the U.S. Market Overview General. Since July 2020, U.S. and Canadian housing demand has been robust. The limited availability of existing homes for sale and the broader need for newly built affordable, single-family housing has continued to drive demand for new homes in these markets. In the second half of fiscal 2023 the demand environment slowed in response to a higher inflationary environment and rising interest rates. As a result, incoming orders from our manufacturing customers in fiscal 2023 decreased compared to the prior fiscal year. In addition, our independent retail customers cancelled stock-model orders in response to the increase in floor plan carrying costs and the desire to optimize their model home inventory based on rising interest rates. In inflationary and higher interest rate environments, factory-built housing provides an affordable alternative to other types of housing such as site-built housing and condominiums, and to existing housing such as pre-owned homes and apartments. According to statistics published by the Institute for Building Technology and Safety (""IBTS"") and the United States Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, for the 2022 calendar year, manufactured housing wholesale shipments of homes constructed in accordance with the HUD code accounted for an estimated 11% of all new single-family homes starts. According to data reported by the Manufactured Housing Institute (“MHI”), industry manufactured home shipments were 104,374, 108,964, and 95,588 units during fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Annual shipments have generally increased each year since calendar year 2009 when only 50,000 HUD-coded manufactured homes were shipped, the lowest level since the industry began recording statistics in 1959. While shipments of HUD-coded manufactured homes have improved modestly in recent years, manufactured housing’s most recent annual shipment levels still operate at lower levels than the long-term historical average of over 200,000 units annually. The market for factory-built housing is affected by a number of factors, including the availability, cost and credit underwriting standards of consumer financing, consumer confidence, employment levels, general housing market, interest rates and other economic conditions and the overall affordability of factory-built housing versus other forms of housing. In the past, a number of factors have restricted demand for factory-built housing, including, in some cases, less-favorable financing terms compared to site-built housing, the effects of restrictive zoning on the availability of certain locations for home placement and, in some cases, an unfavorable public image. Certain of these adverse factors have lessened considerably in recent years with the improved quality and appearance of factory-built housing. Home Buyer Demographics. We believe the segment of the housing market in which manufactured housing is most competitive includes consumers with household incomes under $60,000. This segment has a high representation of young single persons and married couples, first time home buyers, and homebuyers age 55 and older. The comparatively low cost of manufactured homes is attractive to these consumers. People in rural areas, where fewer housing alternatives exist, and those who presently live in factory-built homes, also make up a significant portion of the demand for new factory-built housing. We believe higher-priced, multi-section manufactured and modular homes are attractive to households with higher incomes as an alternative to rental housing and condominiums and are well suited to meet the needs of the retiree buyer in many markets. The two largest manufactured housing consumer demographics are Millennials (generally defined as those born between 1981 – 1996) and Baby Boomers (generally defined as those born between 1946 – 1964). Millennials are generally first-time home buyers who may be attracted by the affordability and diversity of style choices of factory-built homes. Baby Boomers are similarly interested in the value proposition; however, they are also motivated by the energy efficiency and low maintenance requirements of factory-built homes, and by the lifestyle offered by planned communities that are specifically designed for homeowners that fall into this age group. More recently, we have seen a number of market trends pointing to increased sales of ADUs and urban-to-rural migration as customers accommodate working from home patterns as well as people seeking rent-to-own single-family options. Financing Commercial Financing. Independent retailers of factory-built homes generally finance their inventory purchases from manufacturers with floor plan financing provided by third-party lending institutions and secured by a lien on the homes. The availability and cost of floor plan financing can affect the amount of retailer new home inventory, the number of retail sales centers 9 and related wholesale demand. Under a typical floor plan financing arrangement, an independent financial institution specializing in this line of business provides the retailer with a loan for the purchase price of the home and maintains a security interest in the home as collateral. The financial institution customarily requires us, as the manufacturer of the home, to enter into a separate repurchase agreement with the financial institution that, upon default by the retailer and under certain other circumstances, obligates us to repurchase the financed home at declining prices over the term of the repurchase agreement (which, in most cases, is 24 months but under certain circumstances can be until the home is sold by the retailer). The price at which we may be obligated to repurchase a home under these agreements is based upon the amount financed, plus certain administrative and shipping expenses. Our obligation under these repurchase agreements ceases upon the purchase of the home by the retail customer. The maximum amount of our contingent obligations under such repurchase agreements was approximately $386.6 million as of April 1, 2023. The risk of loss under these agreements is spread over many retailers and is further reduced by the resale value of the homes. During fiscal 2023, approximately 34% of our sales to independent retailers were financed under floor plan agreements with national lenders, while the remaining 66% were financed under various arrangements with local or regional banks or paid in cash. We generally receive payment from the lending institution 5 to 10 days after a home is sold and invoiced. Consumer Financing. Sales of factory-built homes are significantly affected by the availability, credit underwriting standards, and cost of consumer financing. There are three basic types of consumer financing in the factory-built housing industry: 1) conforming mortgage loans which comply with the requirements of the Federal Housing Administration (“FHA”), Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Agriculture or Government-Sponsored Enterprise (“GSE”) loans which include Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loans; 2) non-conforming mortgage loans for purchasers of the home and the land on which the home is placed; and 3) personal property loans (often referred to as home-only or chattel loans) for consumers where the home is the sole collateral for the loan (generally HUD-coded homes). Industry trade associations are working towards favorable legislative and GSE action to address the mortgage financing needs of potential buyers of affordable homes, and some progress has been achieved. Many moderate-income families cannot afford to buy a home due to the increasing costs of newly constructed homes, rising interest rates, and decreasing supply of existing, affordable homes. Federal law required the GSEs to issue a regulation to implement the Duty to Serve (“DTS”) requirements specified in the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992, as amended by the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac released their final Underserved Markets Plan for 2022 – 2024 that describes, with specificity, the actions they will take over that three-year period to fulfill the DTS obligation. These plans became effective on January 1, 2022. The GSEs' Underserved Markets Plan's current areas of focus are as follows: 1) purchase more loans used to finance manufactured homes titled as real property; 2) enhance current products and create new offerings; and 3) enhance tenant protections in manufactured housing communities. In 2020, the GSEs rolled out financing programs specifically for homes built to the HUD code, which include CHOICEHome® from Freddie Mac and MH Advantage® from Fannie Mae. HUD-coded homes manufactured for these programs have features comparable to site-built homes, including, drywall throughout, higher-pitch roof line, energy-efficient features, lower profile foundation, plus additional options such as a garage or carport. These products aim to promote quality manufactured homes as an acceptable alternative to site-built homes and will allow moderate-income families to purchase a manufactured home with lending terms similar to those for site-built homes. Our Genesis brand of homes is built to these specifications. We continue to work with builder/developers to cultivate strategies to bring these products to the marketplace. The DTS plans also explored the potential for the GSEs to provide liquidity to the chattel lending market. The GSEs could potentially serve as additional sources of funding as there is unmet demand in the chattel loan industry, and GSE involvement could increase volume substantially. Freddie Mac has indicated that it plans to develop requirements and a process to support loan purchases of manufactured homes titled as real property. The Fannie Mae DTS plan includes a provision indicating that it is exploring a pilot to establish a secondary market for chattel or home-only loans and an objective to explore ways to manage risks in the market. The Fannie Mae DTS plan also includes an objective to explore opportunities to facilitate financing of loans secured by manufactured homes titled as real property in certain manufactured housing communities. Expansion of the secondary market for home-only lending through the GSEs could provide further demand for housing, as lending options would likely become more available to homebuyers. Separate from the GSE involvement in chattel markets, there have been several secondary market chattel private placement offerings over the last three years. Although some limited progress has been made in this area, a meaningful positive impact in the form of increased home orders has yet to be realized. Competition The housing industry is highly competitive based upon several factors, including price, product features, reputation for service and quality, depth of distribution or location, and financing. Capital requirements for entry into the industry are relatively low. Factory-built housing is also very competitive. According to MHI, in March 2023, there were 35 producers of manufactured homes in the U.S. operating an estimated 146 production facilities. For calendar 2022, the top three companies had a combined market share for HUD code homes of approximately 80%. We estimate that there were approximately 3,750 industry retail locations throughout the U.S. during calendar 2022. 10 Based on industry data reported by IBTS, in fiscal 2023 our U.S. wholesale market share of HUD code homes sold was 20.4%, compared to 19.3% in fiscal 2022. We compete with the other producers of manufactured homes, as well as companies selling homes repossessed from wholesalers or consumers. In addition, manufactured homes compete with new and existing site-built homes, as well as apartments, townhouses, and condominiums. Collectively, manufactured housing represents approximately 11% of annual U.S. single family home starts. There are a number of other national and regional manufacturers competing for a significant share of the manufactured housing market in the U.S. Certain of these competitors may possess greater financial, manufacturing, distribution, and marketing resources. Government Regulation Our manufactured homes are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws, codes and regulations. The majority of our homes are built to comply with the HUD code which includes regulations that cover all aspects of manufactured home construction and installation, including structural integrity, fire safety, wind loads, thermal protection and ventilation. To the extent state and local regulations conflict with the HUD code, they are pre-empted. Our modular homes and commercial structures are built to comply with applicable state and local building codes. Our park model RVs are built in conformity with the applicable standards approved by the American National Standards Institute, a private, non-profit organization that administers and coordinates voluntary standards and conformity programs. A variety of laws affect the financing of the homes we manufacture. The Federal Consumer Credit Protection Act and Regulation Z promulgated thereunder require written disclosure of information relating to such financing, including the amount of the annual percentage interest rate and the finance charge. A variety of state laws also regulate the form of financing documents and the allowable deposits, finance charge and fees charged. Federal laws permit manufactured housing retailers to assist home buyers with securing financing for the purchase of homes; however, they are prohibited from negotiating the financing terms. Governmental authorities enforcing these numerous laws and regulations can impose fines and/or seek injunctive relief for violations. We believe that our operations are in compliance with the requirements of the applicable laws and regulations. Seasonality The housing industry is subject to seasonal fluctuations based on home buyer purchasing patterns. We typically experience decreased home buyer traffic during holidays and popular vacation periods. Demand for our core single-family new home products typically peaks each spring and summer before declining in the winter, consistent with the overall housing industry. Available Information Our website address is www.skylinechampion.com and we make available, free of charge, on or through our website all of our periodic reports, including our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K, as soon as reasonably practicable after we file such reports with the SEC. 11 ITEM 1A. RI SK FACTORS Our business involves a number of risks and uncertainties. You should carefully consider the following risks, together with the information provided elsewhere in this Annual Report. The items described below are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks that are currently unknown to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial may also impair our business or adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Market, Industry and Supply Chain Risks Raw material shortages and price increases could delay or increase the cost of construction of our products which could materially and adversely impact our results of operations and our cash flows. Certain materials used in the construction of homes such as lumber, insulation, steel, drywall, oil-based products and fuel, among others, can become scarce during periods of high demand for new home construction as well as renovation and remodeling of existing homes. We depend on timely and sufficient delivery of raw materials from our suppliers. In addition, a few key components of our products are produced by a small group of quality suppliers that have the capacity to supply large quantities. Disruption to the supply chain of these key components could have an adverse impact on our production output. Raw material shortages from these and other suppliers can be more severe during periods following natural disasters or broader economic disruptions. Pricing for raw materials can also be affected by the factors mentioned above as well as national, regional, local, economic and political factors, including tariffs and periods of high inflation. As a result, we may continue to see raw material cost pressures in future periods. We may attempt to pass the higher material costs on to customers, but it is not certain that we will be able to achieve this without adversely affecting demand. Raw material shortages and price increases could cause delays in and increases to our costs of construction which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The factory-built housing industry is cyclical, is affected by seasonality and is sensitive to changes in general economic or other business conditions. The factory-built housing industry is affected by seasonality. Sales during the period from March to November are typically higher than in other months. As a result, our sales and operating results sometimes fluctuate and may continue to fluctuate in the future. The factory-built housing industry is also sensitive to changes in economic conditions and other factors, such as pandemics, employment rates, job growth, population growth, consumer confidence, consumer income, availability of financing, interest rate levels, and an oversupply of homes for sale. Changes in any of these conditions generally, or in the markets where we operate, could reduce demand and constrain pricing for new factory-built homes in these areas or result in customer cancellations of pending shipments. Reductions in the number of homes shipped by us, or constraints on the prices we can charge, could result in a decrease in our net sales and earnings, which could adversely affect our financial condition. We are subject to demand fluctuations in the housing industry. Changes in demand could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Demand for our homes is subject to fluctuations in the housing market generally. In a housing market downturn, our sales and results of operations could be adversely affected; there might be significant inventory impairments and other write-offs; our gross margins could decline significantly from historical levels; and we might incur losses from operations. We cannot predict the future demand for housing. If it were to decline significantly, our financial condition could be adversely affected. Rapid or significantly increasing demand can also adversely affect our business. Longer periods of time between order acceptance and production introduce a risk that we may not be able to construct homes profitably if material and labor costs increase. Although we have generally been able to pass along price increases to our customers in periods of rising costs, we may not be able to in the future, or the price increases may cause consumers to explore other housing alternatives and/or exit the home buying process, negatively impacting demand for our homes. Factory-built housing operates in the highly competitive housing industry, and, if other homebuilders are more successful or offer better value to our customers, then our business could decline. We operate in a very competitive environment and face competition from a number of other homebuilders in each market in which we operate. We compete with large national and regional home building companies and with smaller local homebuilders for financing, raw materials, and skilled management and labor resources. Some of our manufacturing competitors have captive retail distribution systems and consumer finance and insurance operations. In addition, there are independent factory-built housing retail locations that sell competitors’ products in most areas where our homes are sold and in most areas where we have Company-owned retail operations. Because barriers to entry to the industry at both the manufacturing and retail levels are low, we believe that it is 12 relatively easy for new competitors to enter our markets. In addition, our products compete within the housing industry more broadly with other forms of low to moderate-cost housing, including site-built homes, panelized homes, apartments, townhouses, condominiums, and repossessed homes. We also compete with resale homes, also referred to as “previously owned” or “existing” homes, as well as rental housing. An oversupply of homes available for sale or the heavy discounting of home prices by our competitors could adversely affect demand for our homes and the results of our operations. An increase in competitive conditions could have any of the following impacts on us: sale of fewer homes or higher cancellations by our homebuyers; an increase in selling incentives or reduction of prices; and realization of lower gross margins due to lower selling prices or an inability to increase selling prices to offset increased costs of the homes delivered. If we are unable to compete effectively in our markets, then our business could decline disproportionately to that of our competitors. As a result, our sales could decline and our results of operations and cash flows could suffer. Changes in consumer preferences for our products or our failure to gauge those preferences could lead to reduced sales. We cannot be certain that historical consumer preferences for factory-built homes in general, and for our products in particular, will remain unchanged. Our ability to remain competitive depends heavily on our ability to provide a continuing and timely introduction of innovative product offerings. We believe that the introduction of new features, designs, and models will be critical to the future success of our operations. Managing frequent product introductions poses inherent risks. Delays in the introduction or market acceptance of new models, designs, or product features could have a material adverse effect on our business. Products may not be accepted for a number of reasons, including changes in consumer preferences or our failure to properly gauge consumer preferences. Further, we cannot be certain that new product introductions will not reduce net sales from existing models and adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, our net sales may be adversely affected if our new models and products are not introduced to the market on time or are not successful when introduced. Finally, our competitors’ products may obtain better market acceptance despite our efforts to lead the market. Increases in tax rates or fees on developers by local government authorities could deter potential customers from buying our products and adversely affect our business or results of operations. Increases in property tax rates or fees on developers by local governmental authorities, as experienced in response to reduced federal and state funding or to fund local initiatives, such as funding schools or road improvements, or increases in home insurance premiums, can adversely affect the ability of potential customers to obtain financing or their desire to purchase new homes, and in turn can have adverse impacts on our business and results of operations. Any changes to individual tax rules concerning the deductibility of mortgage interest expenses and real estate taxes could deter customers from home ownership. Natural disasters and severe weather conditions could delay deliveries, increase costs, and decrease demand for new factory-built homes in affected areas. Our operations are located in many areas that are subject to natural disasters and severe weather. The occurrence of natural disasters or severe weather conditions can delay factory-built home deliveries, increase costs by damaging inventories, reduce the availability of materials, and negatively impact the demand for new factory-built homes in affected areas. Furthermore, if our insurance does not fully cover business interruptions or losses resulting from these events, then our earnings, liquidity, or capital resources could be adversely affected. Increased attention to environmental, social and governance matters may impact our business, financial results or stock price. Increased attention continues to be directed to publicly traded companies and their activities related to environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) matters, including proposed rules by the SEC regarding climate-related disclosures. Advocacy groups have campaigned for action to promote change at public companies related to ESG matters. These activities include increasing action related to climate change and the use of energy efficient building products. A failure, or perceived failure, to respond to investor or customer expectations related to ESG concerns could cause harm to our business and reputation. In addition, organizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and other matters have developed ratings systems for evaluating companies on their approach to ESG. Unfavorable ESG ratings may lead to negative investor sentiment which could have a negative impact on our stock price. Our results of operations may be adversely affected by public health issues, such as an epidemic or pandemic, and resulting governmental actions. An epidemic, pandemic or other public health issue, or fear of such an event, and the actions taken by governmental authorities to address it, could significantly disrupt or prevent us from operating our business and, along with any associated economic factors, have a material adverse effect on our business. The United States and Canada have experienced, and may experience in the future, outbreaks of contagious diseases that affect public health and have necessitated government intervention. The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures undertaken by governmental authorities to address it, initially disrupted or prevented us from operating parts of our 13 business in the ordinary course. The extent to which public health issues impact our results will depend on future developments, which cannot be predicted. If an epidemic, pandemic or similar public health issue has a significant adverse effect on the U.S. or Canadian economies, our business, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. Regulatory Risks Environmental laws and regulations relating to climate change and energy efficiency can have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations. Federal, state, and local government regulations proposed or enacted in response to climate change could result in raw material and other cost increases as well as impact the availability of raw materials necessary to manufacture our products. In 2021, the U.S. Department of Energy proposed regulations to enact new energy efficiency building specifications for manufactured homes. If adopted, these proposed regulations would result in changes to the HUD-code requiring more robust energy efficiency specifications and require the use of energy-saving construction material in our products. New building code requirements that impose stricter energy efficiency standards could significantly increase our costs. Compliance with these new standards may also cause an increase in our costs, including investments in testing equipment and the use of human capital resources. As climate change and energy efficiency remains a global focus, energy-related initiatives will impact many companies including our raw material suppliers. The initiatives undertaken by our suppliers could adversely impact our results of operations to the extent our suppliers raise their prices to cover energy and climate related initiatives. Increases in costs may make our products less affordable and as a result, negatively impact demand for those products. If the factory-built housing industry is not able to secure favorable local zoning ordinances, our sales could decline and our results of operations and cash flows could suffer. Limitations on the number of sites available for placement of factory-built homes or on the operation of factory-built housing communities could reduce the demand for factory-built homes and, as a result, our sales. Factory-built housing communities and individual home placements are subject to local zoning ordinances and other local regulations relating to utility service and construction of roadways. In the past, some property owners have resisted the adoption of zoning ordinances permitting the use of factory-built homes in residential areas, which we believe has restricted the growth of the industry. Factory-built homes may not receive widespread acceptance and localities may not adopt zoning ordinances permitting the development of factory-built home communities. If the factory-built housing industry is unable to secure favorable local zoning ordinances, then our sales could decline and our results of operations and cash flows could suffer. We are subject to extensive regulation affecting the production and sale of factory-built housing, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We are subject to a variety of federal, state, and local laws and regulations affecting the production and sale of factory-built housing. Our failure to comply with such laws and regulations could expose us to a wide variety of sanctions, including closing one or more manufacturing facilities. Regulatory matters affecting our operations are under regular review by governmental bodies and we cannot predict what effect, if any, new laws and regulations would have on us or on the factory-built housing industry. Failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or the passage in the future of new and more stringent laws, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The transportation industry is subject to government regulation, and regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Our Star Fleet Trucking subsidiary provides transportation services. The transportation industry is subject to legislative or regulatory changes, including potential limits on carbon emissions under climate change legislation and Department of Transportation regulations regarding, among other things, driver breaks, classification of independent drivers, “restart” rules, and the use of electronic logging devices that can affect the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or influencing the demand for, and cost of providing, transportation services. We may become subject to new or more restrictive regulations relating to fuel emissions or limits on vehicle weight and size. Future laws and regulations may be more stringent and require changes in operating practices, influence the demand for transportation services or increase the cost of providing transportation services, any of which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Operational Risks Our results of operations can be adversely affected by labor shortages, turnover and labor cost inflation. The homebuilding industry has from time-to-time experienced labor shortages and other labor-related issues. These labor shortages can be more severe during periods of strong demand for housing, during periods following natural disasters or as a result of broader economic disruptions. A number of factors may adversely affect the labor force available to us and our subcontractors in one 14 or more of our markets, including high employment levels, federal unemployment subsidies, changing work preferences of the labor force, and other government regulations, which include laws and regulations related to workers’ health and safety, wage and hour practices and immigration. These factors can also increase the cost of labor. We have historically experienced high turnover rates among our direct labor employees, which can lead to increased spending on training and retention and, as a result, increased costs of production. An overall labor shortage or lack of skilled labor, increased turnover or labor inflation could cause significant increases in costs or delays in construction and delivery of homes, which could have a material adverse effect on our net sales and results of operations. Increased costs of transportation may adversely affect our operating results and cash flows. We rely on qualified drivers to deliver homes from our manufacturing facilities to retail centers and customer home sites. A lack of qualified drivers to deliver manufactured homes could result in an increase in our cost of goods sold and operating expenses. Additionally, delays in the shipment of completed homes due to lack of qualified drivers could impact our ability to meet customer demand on a timely basis. Customer cancellations could have a negative impact on our revenue and margins. Our backlog represents home orders from customers that will be produced in future periods. Orders in the backlog may be cancelled by customers at any time without penalty. Orders in the backlog may be impacted by rising interest rates as retailers utilize floor plan financing arrangements to purchase stock inventory. Orders in backlog may also be impacted by inflation since customers obtain financing approval prior to ordering a home. Significant increases in prices may prevent customers from being able to qualify for financing at the time the home is ready to be produced causing the customer to cancel their order in our backlog which would negatively impact our revenue and margins. Complications with the implementation of our new enterprise-wide information system could adversely impact our business and operations. We rely on information systems and technology to manage our business and summarize and report our operating results. In fiscal 2022, we began a multi-year replacement of our current information systems with a suite of cloud-based functionality. With the new system, we expect to improve decision-making capabilities through real-time data and analytics, simplify and standardize business processes, reduce manual effort, improve value-added activities, and improve transparency and accountability all while enhancing the customer experience making our company easier to do business with. The system selection and implementation process has required, and will continue to require, a significant investment of personnel and financial resources. We may not be able to successfully implement the new system without experiencing delays, increased costs, interruption to operations, or other difficulties. If we are unable to successfully implement the system as planned, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted. We have capitalized significant costs related to the development of the new system. A write-off of all or part of our capitalized costs could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, if we do not effectively implement the system as planned or it does not operate as intended, the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting could be adversely affected or our ability to assess those controls adequately could be delayed. If we are unable to establish or maintain relationships with independent distributors that sell our homes, our sales could decline and our results of operations and cash flows could suffer. Although we maintain our own factory direct retail business in select markets, we conduct a majority of our business through independent distributors. Over 90% of our shipments of homes in fiscal 2023 were made to independent distributors throughout the U.S. and western Canada. We may not be able to establish relationships with new independent distributors or maintain good relationships with independent distributors that sell our homes. Even if we establish and maintain relationships with independent distributors, these customers are not obligated to sell our homes exclusively and may choose to sell competitors’ homes instead. The independent distributors with whom we have relationships can cancel these relationships on short notice. In addition, these customers may not remain financially solvent, as they are subject to industry, economic, demographic, and seasonal trends similar to those faced by us. If we do not establish and maintain relationships with solvent independent distributors in the markets we serve, sales in those markets, if we cannot offset by sales through an expanded factory-direct retail business, could decline and our results of operations and cash flows could suffer. When we introduce new products into the marketplace, we may incur expenses that we did not anticipate, which, in turn, can result in reduced earnings. The introduction of new models, floor plans, and features are critical to our future success, but we may incur unexpected expenses when we make such introductions. For example, we may experience unexpected engineering or design flaws that may cause increased warranty costs. The costs resulting from these types of problems could be substantial and could have a significant adverse effect on our earnings. Estimated warranty costs are accrued at the time of product sale to reflect our best estimate of the amounts 15 necessary to settle existing and future claims on products. An increase in actual warranty claims costs as compared to our estimates could result in increased warranty reserves and expense, which could have adverse impacts on our earnings. Product liability claims and litigation and warranty claims that arise in the ordinary course of business may be costly, which could adversely affect our results of operations. As a homebuilder, we are subject to construction defect and home warranty claims arising in the ordinary course of business. These claims are common in the homebuilding industry and can be costly. In addition, the costs of insuring against construction defect and product liability claims are high. There can be no assurance that this coverage will not be restricted and become more costly. If the limits or coverages of our current and former insurance programs prove inadequate, or we are unable to obtain adequate or reasonably priced insurance against these types of claims in the future, or the amounts currently provided for future warranty or insurance claims are inadequate, then we may experience losses that could negatively impact our results of operations. We record expenses and liabilities based on the estimated costs required to cover our self-insured liability under our insurance policies, and estimated costs of potential claims and claim adjustment expenses that are above our coverage limits or that are not covered by our insurance policies. These estimated costs are based on an analysis of our historical claims and industry data and include an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. Due to the degree of judgment required and the potential for variability in the underlying assumptions when deriving estimated liabilities, our actual future costs could differ from those estimated, and the difference could be material to our results of operations. Our products and services may experience quality problems from time to time that can result in decreased sales and gross margin and can harm our reputation. Our products contain thousands of parts, many of which are supplied by a network of approved vendors. Product defects may occur, including components purchased from material vendors. There is no assurance that all such defects will be detected prior to the distribution of our products. In addition, although we endeavor to compel suppliers to maintain appropriate levels of insurance coverage, there is no assurance that if a defect in a vendor-supplied part were to occur that the vendor would have the financial ability to rectify the defect. Failure to detect defects in our products, including vendor-supplied parts, could result in lost revenue, increased warranty and related costs, and could harm our reputation. We may not be able to manage our business effectively if we cannot retain current management team members or if we are unable to attract and motivate key personnel. Our success depends upon the skills, experience, and active participation of our senior management and key employees, many of whom have been with us for a significant number of years. Changes in our senior management team or other key employees may result in operational disruptions and changes to the strategy of our business, and our business might be harmed as a result. Our business could be further disrupted and harmed if we were unable to find appropriate replacements on a timely basis following future departures. We may not be able to attract or motivate qualified management and operations personnel in the future. Inability to do so would result in constraints that would significantly impede the achievement of our objectives. We may also have difficulty attracting experienced personnel and may be required to expend significant financial resources in our employee recruitment efforts. Data security breaches, cybersecurity attacks, and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer. In the ordinary course of our business, we collect, use, and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our suppliers and business partners, as well as personally identifiable information of our customers and employees. We also have outsourced elements of our information technology structure and, as a result, we are managing independent vendor relationships with third parties who may or could have access to our confidential information. Similarly, our business partners and other third-party providers possess certain of our sensitive data. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Our ability to conduct our business may be negatively impacted if our or our service providers’ computer resources or connectivity are compromised, degraded, damaged, or if they fail. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance, or other disruptions, particularly with employees and others on data networks working increasingly from home. We, our partners, vendors, and other third-party providers could be susceptible to third-party attacks on our and their information security systems, which attacks are of ever-increasing levels of sophistication and are made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise, including criminal groups. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost, or stolen. Any such access, disclosure, or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, disrupt our operations, and damage our reputation, any of which could adversely affect our business. 16 Engaging in mergers, acquisitions, and start-up operations involves risks that could adversely affect our business. As part of our growth strategy, we may choose to engage in discussions and negotiations regarding mergers, acquisitions, start-ups, and other business combinations. The purchase price for possible acquisitions of businesses and assets might be paid from cash, borrowings, or through the issuance of common stock or other securities, or a combination of these methods. Business combinations and start-up operations entail numerous risks, including: We cannot be certain that we will be able to identify, consummate and successfully integrate business combinations, and no assurance can be given with respect to the timing, likelihood or business effect of any possible transaction. For example, we could begin negotiations that we subsequently decide to suspend or terminate for a variety of reasons. Also, business combinations are typically subject to closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and the absence of a material adverse change. Therefore, if and when we enter into a business combination agreement, there can be no guarantee that the transaction will close when expected, or at all. If a material transaction does not close, then our stock price could decline. Nevertheless, opportunities arise from time to time that we choose to evaluate. Any transactions that we pursue and consummate would involve these risks and uncertainties, as well as others. The risks of a business combination or startup of a greenfield or idled facility could result in the failure of the anticipated benefits of that particular transaction to be realized, which in turn could have adverse effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Our risk management practices may leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risk. Our management team is responsible for managing risk, subject to oversight by our Board of Directors. Our risk management methods may not identify all future risk exposures and may not be completely effective in mitigating all key risks. Furthermore, our risk management methods may not properly identify and mitigate the aggregation of risks across the Company or the interdependency of our risk mitigation efforts. In addition, some of our risk management methods may be based on assumptions that will prove to be inaccurate. Failure to manage risk effectively could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Financial Risks Further increases in interest rates, more stringent credit standards, tightening of financing terms, or other increases in the effective costs of owning a factory-built home (including those related to regulation or other government actions) have limited and could continue to limit the purchasing power of our potential customers and could continue to adversely affect our business and financial results. A large portion of the people who buy our homes finance their home purchases through third-party lenders. Increases in interest rates or decreases in the availability of consumer financing have affected and could continue to adversely affect the market for homes. Interest rates were near historical lows for several years, which made purchasing new factory-built homes more affordable. However, since early 2022, the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee has continuously raised the target rate for the federal funds rate and could effectuate additional increases in that rate in response to inflation. Potential manufactured housing customers have been and may continue to be less willing or able to pay the increased monthly costs that result from higher loan rates. In addition, recent increases in the prices of homes resulting from inflation, combined with higher loan rates, have limited and may continue to limit consumers’ ability to obtain financing to purchase a home. In addition, lenders may increase the qualifications needed for financing or adjust their terms to address any increased credit risk. These factors could continue to adversely affect the sales or pricing of our factory-built homes. These developments have historically had, and may once again have, an adverse effect on the overall demand for factory-built housing and its competitiveness with other forms of housing and could continue to adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. The liquidity provided by the GSEs and the FHA is also critical in insuring or purchasing home mortgages and creating or insuring investment securities that are either sold to investors or held in their portfolios. Any limitations or restrictions on the availability of financing by these agencies could adversely affect interest rates, financing, and our sales of new homes. 17 Inflation has and could continue to adversely affect our business and financial results. Inflation adversely affects us by increasing costs of raw materials, labor and transportation. The U.S. economy has been experiencing a period of higher inflation, stemming from efforts by the U.S. government to stimulate the economy, combat the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and other factors. The increased rate of inflation has also lead to higher interest rates, which has had and continue to have a negative impact on the housing industry, as well as increases in our borrowing rates. While we have historically been able to pass along price increases to our customers, in a persistently inflationary environment, we may not be able to raise prices sufficiently in order to maintain our margins. The availability of wholesale financing for retailers is limited due to a limited number of floor plan lenders and reduced lending limits. Factory-built housing retailers generally finance their inventory purchases with wholesale floor plan financing provided by lending institutions. The availability of wholesale financing is significantly affected by the number of floor plan lenders and their lending limits. Limited availability of floor plan lending negatively affects the inventory levels of our independent retailers, the number of retail sales center locations and related wholesale demand, and adversely affects the availability of and access to capital on an ongoing basis. As a result, if the availability of wholesale financing is reduced, we could experience sales declines or a higher level of customer defaults and our operating results and cash flows could suffer. We have contingent repurchase obligations related to wholesale financing provided to industry retailers. As is customary in the factory-built housing industry, a significant portion of our manufacturing sales to independent retailers are financed under floor plan agreements with financing companies. In connection with those floor plan financing programs, we generally have separate agreements with the financing companies that require us to repurchase homes upon default by the retailer and repossession of the homes by the financing companies. These repurchase agreements are applicable for various periods of time, generally up to 24 months after the sale of the home to the retailer. However, certain homes are subject to repurchase until the home is sold by the retailer. Our contingent repurchase obligation as of April 1, 2023, was estimated to be approximately $386.6 million, without reduction for the resale value of the homes. We may be required to honor contingent repurchase obligations in the future and may incur additional expense and reduced cash flows because of these repurchase agreements. Industry conditions and future operating results could limit our sources of capital. If we are unable to locate suitable sources of capital when needed, we may be unable to maintain or expand our business. We depend on our cash balances, cash flows from operations, and our revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) to finance our operating requirements, capital expenditures, and other needs. If our cash balances, cash flows from operations, and availability under the Credit Facility are insufficient to finance our operations and alternative capital is not available, then we may not be able to expand our business and make acquisitions, or we may need to curtail or limit our existing operations. Changes in foreign exchange rates could adversely affect the value of our investments in Canada and cause foreign exchange losses. We have substantial investments in businesses in Canada. Unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates could adversely affect the value of our investments in these businesses. An impairment of all or part of our goodwill could adversely affect our operating results and net worth. As of April 1, 2023, 12.6% of our total assets consisted of goodwill, all of which is allocated to reporting units included in the U.S. Factory-built Housing segment. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") Accounting Standards Codification (""ASC"") 350, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other (""ASC 350""), we test goodwill at least annually for impairment or more often than annually if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment is more likely than not to have occurred. If goodwill has become impaired, we charge the impairment as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs. See Item 7, ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" and Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. A write-off of all or part of our goodwill could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could harm our business and financial results. Our management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that we would prevent or detect a misstatement of our financial statements or fraud. We anticipate paying no cash dividends for the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, for the foreseeable future, to fund the development and growth of our business. As a result, capital appreciation in the price of our common stock, if any, will be investors’ only source of gain on an investment in our common stock. Any future determination to pay dividends to shareholders will be at the sole discretion of our Board 18 of Directors and will depend upon many factors, including general economic conditions, our financial condition and results of operations, our available cash and current and anticipated cash needs, capital requirements, contractual, legal, tax and regulatory restrictions, the implications of the payment of dividends by us to our shareholders or by our subsidiaries to us, and any other factors that the Board of Directors may deem relevant. 19 ITEM 1B.

We also have 31 retail sales centers located across the U.S. and nine terminals for our logistics operations across four states in the U.S. The corporate offices, some of our retail sales centers, and logistics terminals are leased properties. The contractual lease for our Troy, Michigan office expires in December 2027 and the contractual lease for our Elkhart, Indiana office expires in September 2028. Two of the manufacturing facilities are encumbered by industrial revenue bonds. In the opinion of management, our properties have been well maintained, are in sound operating condition, and contain all equipment and facilities necessary to operate at present levels. We also own or lease eight idle manufacturing facilities which could be utilized for additional production capacity. Those facilities would likely require capital investments in order to secure and equip them for operations. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS We are party to certain legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course and are incidental to our business. Certain of the claims pending against us in these proceedings allege, among other things, breach of express and implied warranties, and in various governmental agency proceedings arising from occupational safety and health, wage and hour, and similar employment and workplace regulations. Although litigation is inherently uncertain, based on past experience and the information currently available, management does not believe that the currently pending and threatened litigation or claims will have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations. However, future events or circumstances, currently unknown to us, will determine whether the resolution of pending or threatened litigation or claims will ultimately have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of operations in any future reporting periods.

Overview The Company is a leading producer of factory-built housing in the U.S. and Canada. The Company serves as a complete solutions provider across complementary and vertically integrated businesses including manufactured construction, company-owned retail locations, construction services, and transportation logistics. The Company is the largest independent publicly traded factory-built solutions provider in North America based on revenue, and markets its homes under several nationally recognized brand names including Skyline Homes, Champion Home Builders, Genesis Homes, Athens Park Models, Dutch Housing, Atlantic Homes, Excel Homes, Homes of Merit, New Era, Redman Homes, ScotBilt Homes, Shore Park, Silvercrest, and Titan Homes in the U.S. and Moduline and SRI Homes in western Canada. The Company operates 38 manufacturing facilities throughout the U.S. and five manufacturing facilities in western Canada that primarily construct factory-built, timber-framed manufactured and modular houses that are sold primarily to independent retailers, builders/developers, and manufactured home community operators. The Company’s retail operations consist of 31 sales centers that sell manufactured homes to consumers across the U.S. The Company’s transportation business engages independent owners/drivers to transport manufactured homes, recreational vehicles, and other products throughout the U.S. and Canada. Acquisitions and Expansions Over the last several years, demand for affordable housing in the U.S. has increased. As a result, the Company focused on operational improvements to increase capacity utilization and profitability at its existing manufacturing facilities as well as executed measured expansion of its manufacturing footprint through facility and equipment investments and acquisitions. During fiscal 2023, robust demand began to slow as inflation and higher interest rates made housing less affordable. Even though the housing markets have slowed, the Company continues to focus on growing in strong housing markets across the U.S. and Canada, as well as expanding products and services to provide more holistic solutions to homebuyers. In July 2022, the Company acquired 12 Factory Expo retail sales centers from Alta Cima Corporation, which expanded the internal retail network across a broader portion of the U.S. In May 2022, the Company acquired Manis Custom Builders, Inc. (""Manis"") in order to expand its manufacturing footprint and further streamline its product offering in the Southeast U.S. In February 2021, the Company acquired ScotBilt Homes, LLC and related companies (collectively, ""ScotBilt""), which operated two manufacturing facilities in Georgia providing affordable housing throughout Alabama, Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas. The ScotBilt acquisition complemented the Company’s existing manufacturing footprint in the attractive mid-south region. The Company is also focused on streamlining its U.S. manufacturing production capacity through various plant start-ups. In June 2021, the Company acquired two idle facilities in Navasota, Texas in order to increase its production capabilities in the Texas market. The Company began production at one of those facilities during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. In January 2021, the Company acquired two idle facilities in Pembroke, North Carolina, and began production at one of those facilities in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. The Company is also in the process of opening previously idled facilities in Bartow, Florida and Decatur, Indiana, both of which are expecting to begin production in fiscal 2024. The Company's acquisitions and investments are part of a strategy to grow and diversify revenue with a focus on increasing the Company’s homebuilding presence in the U.S. as well as improving the results of operations through streamlining production of similar product categories. These acquisitions and investments are included in the Company's consolidated results for periods subsequent to their respective acquisition dates. Industry and Company Outlook 24 Since July 2020, U.S. and Canadian housing industry demand has been robust. The limited availability of existing homes for sale and the broader need for newly built affordable, single-family housing has continued to drive demand for new homes in these markets. In recent years, manufactured home construction experienced revenue growth due to a number of favorable demographic trends and demand drivers in the United States, including underlying growth trends in key homebuyer groups, such as the population over 55 years of age, the population of first-time home buyers, and the population of households earning less than $60,000 per year. More recently, we have seen a number of market trends pointing to increased sales of ADUs and urban-to-rural migration as customers accommodate working-from-home patterns, as well as people seeking rent-to-own single-family options. The recent increases in interest rates in response to inflation have impacted the demand for the Company's products in both the U.S. and Canada. As a result, incoming orders from our manufacturing customers in fiscal 2023 decreased compared to the prior fiscal year. In addition, our independent retail customers have cancelled stock-model orders in response to the increase in floor plan carrying costs and the desire to optimize their model home inventory based on rising interest rates. The Company's backlog at the end of fiscal 2023 was $308.1 million compared to $1.6 billion at the end of fiscal 2022. The decrease in backlog was primarily driven by lower net orders. Cancellation of end-consumer orders, at the retail level, have been minimal. For fiscal 2023, approximately 87% of the Company’s U.S. manufacturing sales were generated from the manufacture of homes that comply with the Federal HUD code construction standard in the U.S. According to data reported by MHI, HUD-code industry home shipments were 104,374, 108,964, and 95,588 units during fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Based on industry data, the Company’s U.S. wholesale market share of HUD code homes sold was 20.4%, 19.3%, and 16.9% in fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Annual industry shipments have generally increased each year since calendar year 2009 when only 50,000 HUD-coded manufactured homes were shipped, the lowest level since the industry began recording statistics in 1959. While shipments of HUD-coded manufactured homes have improved modestly in recent years, current manufactured housing shipments are still at lower levels than the long-term historical average of over 200,000 units per year. Manufactured home sales represent approximately 11% of all U.S. single family home starts. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR FISCAL 2023 VS. 2022 Year Ended (Dollars in thousands) April 1, 2023 April 2, 2022 Results of Operations Data: Net sales $ 2,606,560 $ 2,207,229 Cost of sales 1,787,879 1,618,106 Gross profit 818,681 589,123 Selling, general, and administrative expenses 300,396 256,218 Operating income 518,285 332,905 Interest (income) expense, net (14,977 ) 2,512 Other income, net (634 ) (36 ) Income from operations before income taxes 533,896 330,429 Income tax expense 132,094 82,385 Net income $ 401,802 $ 248,044 Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA: Net income $ 401,802 $ 248,044 Income tax expense 132,094 82,385 Interest (income) expense, net (14,977 ) 2,512 Depreciation and amortization 26,726 20,936 Transaction costs 338 — Other (972 ) — Adjusted EBITDA $ 545,011 $ 353,877 As a percent of net sales: Gross profit 31.4 % 26.7 % Selling, general and administrative expenses 11.5 % 11.6 % Operating income 19.9 % 15.1 % Net income 15.4 % 11.2 % Adjusted EBITDA 20.9 % 16.0 % 25 FISCAL PERIODS The Company’s fiscal year is a 52- or 53-week period that ends on the Saturday nearest March 31. Fiscal 2023 and 2022 were each 52-week periods. NET SALES The following table summarizes net sales for fiscal 2023 and 2022: Year Ended (Dollars in thousands) April 1, 2023 April 2, 2022 $ Change % Change Net sales $ 2,606,560 $ 2,207,229 $ 399,331 18.1 % U.S. manufacturing and retail net sales $ 2,411,342 $ 1,991,066 $ 420,276 21.1 % U.S. homes sold 24,736 24,686 50 0.2 % U.S. manufacturing and retail average home selling price $ 97.5 $ 80.7 $ 16.8 20.8 % Canadian manufacturing net sales $ 144,289 $ 159,124 $ (14,835 ) (9.3 %) Canadian homes sold 1,174 1,479 (305 ) (20.6 %) Canadian manufacturing average home selling price $ 122.9 $ 107.6 $ 15.3 14.2 % Corporate/Other net sales $ 50,929 $ 57,039 $ (6,110 ) (10.7 %) U.S. manufacturing facilities in operation at year end 38 36 2 6 % U.S. retail sales centers in operation at year end 31 18 13 72 % Canadian manufacturing facilities in operation at year end 5 5 — — % Net sales for fiscal 2023 were $2.6 billion an increase of $399.3 million, or 18.1%, over fiscal 2022. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. U.S. Factory-built Housing: Fiscal 2023 net sales for the Company’s U.S. manufacturing and retail operations increased by $420.3 million, or 21.1%, over fiscal 2022. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the average home selling price of 20.8%. The average selling price increased in fiscal 2023 compared to the prior fiscal year due to pricing actions enacted in response to rising material, freight, and labor costs as well as the impact of sales to FEMA of $200.3 million. FEMA units generally have more specifications than our typical products and therefore drive a higher average selling price per home. Canadian Factory-built Housing: The Canadian Factory-built Housing segment net sales decreased by $14.8 million, or 9.3% for fiscal 2023 compared to the prior year, primarily due to a 20.6% decrease in homes sold, partially offset by a 14.2% increase in average selling price per new home. The increase in average selling price was due to pricing actions taken in response to rising material and labor costs and a change in product mix. The decrease in homes sold is due to slowing demand in certain regions of Canada and a shift in mix. Net sales for the Canadian segment were also unfavorably impacted by approximately $6.6 million as the Canadian dollar weakened relative to the U.S. dollar during fiscal 2023 as compared to the prior year. Corporate/Other: Net sales for Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation business and the elimination of intersegment sales. During fiscal 2023, net sales for the segment decreased by $6.1 million, or 10.7%, compared to fiscal 2022. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in shipments of recreational vehicles due to a decrease in that industry's demand. 26 GROSS PROFIT The following table summarizes gross profit for fiscal 2023 and 2022: Year Ended (Dollars in thousands) April 1, 2023 April 2, 2022 $ Change % Change Gross profit: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 757,521 $ 530,252 $ 227,269 42.9 % Canadian Factory-built Housing 44,640 43,493 1,147 2.6 % Corporate/Other 16,520 15,378 1,142 7.4 % Total gross profit $ 818,681 $ 589,123 $ 229,558 39.0 % Gross profit as a percent of net sales 31.4 % 26.7 % Gross profit as a percent of sales during fiscal 2023 was 31.4% compared to 26.7% during fiscal 2022. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. U.S. Factory-built Housing: Gross profit for the U.S. Factory-built Housing segment increased by $227.3 million, or 42.9%, during fiscal 2023 compared to the prior year. The increase in gross profit was primarily driven by the increase in revenue in fiscal 2023. As a percent of net sales, gross profit was 31.4% for fiscal 2023 compared to 26.6% in the prior fiscal year. Sales to FEMA during the first half of fiscal 2023 increased gross profit and gross profit as a percent of sales since FEMA units are generally at higher prices and have more specifications than our core products, which helps offset the disruption to our operations and our customers. In addition, input costs primarily related to forest products decreased while price increases for our products were still in effect. In the second half of fiscal 2023, we lowered certain material surcharges in response to lower input costs, we saw a decrease in volume allowing less leverage of fixed costs and we saw a shift to smaller, less optioned homes which lowered gross profit margins to more normal levels. Canadian Factory-built Housing: Gross profit for the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment increased by $1.1 million, or 2.6%, during fiscal 2023 compared to the prior year. Gross profit increased to 30.9% as a percent of segment net sales from 27.3% in the prior year. The increase in gross profit was due to the increase in average selling prices of new homes and lower material input costs. However, demand in Canada declined in the second half of fiscal 2023 which has put pressure on gross profit margins due to less leverage of fixed costs at lower production volumes. Corporate/Other: Gross profit for the Corporate/Other segment increased by $1.1 million, or 7.4%, during fiscal 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year. Corporate/Other gross profit improved as a percent of segment net sales to 32.4% from 27.0%. Gross margin for the Company’s transportation business improved due to a change in revenue mix. SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Selling, general, and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses include foreign currency transaction gains and losses, equity compensation, and intangible amortization expense. The following table summarizes SG&A expenses for fiscal 2023 and 2022: Year Ended (Dollars in thousands) April 1, 2023 April 2, 2022 $ Change % Change Selling, general, and administrative expenses: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 221,498 $ 187,697 $ 33,801 18.0 % Canadian Factory-built Housing 12,932 12,912 20 0.2 % Corporate/Other 65,966 55,609 10,357 18.6 % Total selling, general, and administrative expenses $ 300,396 $ 256,218 $ 44,178 17.2 % Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales 11.5 % 11.6 % SG&A expenses were $300.4 million during fiscal 2023, an increase of $44.2 million compared to the prior year. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. 27 U.S. Factory-built Housing: SG&A expenses for the U.S. Factory-built Housing segment increased by $33.8 million, or 18.0%, during fiscal 2023 as compared to the prior year. SG&A expenses, as a percent of segment net sales, declined to 9.2% in fiscal 2023 compared to 9.4% during fiscal 2022. SG&A costs increased due to a combination of factors, primarily (i) additional expenses for acquisitions and new plant startups (ii) higher sales commissions and incentive compensation, which is generally based on sales volume or a measure of profitability; (iii) and increased marketing and trade-show expense. Canadian Factory-built Housing: SG&A expenses for the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment remained consistent compared to the prior year. SG&A expenses, as a percent of segment net sales, were 9.0% during fiscal 2023 compared to 8.1% in fiscal 2022. The increase in SG&A as a percent of net sales is a the result of the decrease in net sales for the segment. Corporate/Other: SG&A expenses for Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation operations, corporate costs incurred for all segments, and intersegment eliminations. SG&A expenses for Corporate/Other increased by $10.4 million, or 18.6%, during fiscal 2023 as compared to the prior year. The increase is mainly due to increased equity compensation and investments made to enhance our online customer experience and support systems. INTEREST (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET The following table summarizes the components of interest (income) expense, net for fiscal 2023 and 2022: Year Ended (Dollars in thousands) April 1, 2023 April 2, 2022 $ Change % Change Interest expense $ 3,276 $ 3,245 $ 31 1.0 % Interest income (18,253 ) (733 ) (17,520 ) 2,390.2 % Interest (income) expense, net $ (14,977 ) $ 2,512 $ (17,489 ) (696.2 %) Average outstanding floor plan payable $ 25,756 $ 31,485 Average outstanding long-term debt $ 12,430 $ 19,155 Interest (income) expense, net was $15.0 million of income for fiscal 2023, compared to $2.5 million of expense in the prior year. The change was primarily due to higher interest income from higher average invested cash balances and higher interest rates in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. Interest expense was flat for the year as a result of higher interest rates offsetting the benefit of paying off our outstanding floor plan payable balance in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. OTHER INCOME, NET The following table summarizes other income, net for fiscal 2023 and 2022: Year Ended (Dollars in thousands) April 1, 2023 April 2, 2022 $ Change % Change Other income, net $ (634 ) $ (36 ) $ (598 ) 1,661.1 % Other income, net increased $0.6 million during fiscal 2023 compared to the prior year. During the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company received insurance proceeds for partial settlement of certain Champion Homes Builders' pre-bankruptcy workers' compensation claims, which was partially offset by transaction costs incurred for the acquisition of Manis. INCOME TAX EXPENSE The following table summarizes income tax expense for fiscal 2023 and 2022: Year Ended (Dollars in thousands) April 1, 2023 April 2, 2022 $ Change % Change Income tax expense $ 132,094 $ 82,385 $ 49,709 60.3 % Effective tax rate 24.7 % 24.9 % 28 Income tax expense during fiscal 2023 was $132.1 million, representing an effective tax rate of 24.7%, compared to income tax expense of $82.4 million, representing an effective tax rate of 24.9%, in fiscal 2022. The Company’s effective tax rate for both fiscal 2023 and 2022 differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of 21.0%, due primarily to the effect of non-deductible expenses, state and local income taxes, and foreign rate differential, partially offset by tax credits. ADJUSTED EBITDA The following table reconciles net income, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, to Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, for fiscal 2023 and 2022: Year Ended (Dollars in thousands) April 1, 2023 April 2, 2022 $ Change % Change Net income $ 401,802 $ 248,044 $ 153,758 62.0 % Income tax expense 132,094 82,385 49,709 60.3 % Interest (income) expense, net (14,977 ) 2,512 (17,489 ) (696.2 %) Depreciation and amortization 26,726 20,936 5,790 27.7 % Transaction costs 338 — 338 * Other (972 ) — (972 ) * Adjusted EBITDA $ 545,011 $ 353,877 $ 191,134 54.0 % * indicates that the calculated percentage is not meaningful Adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2023 was $545.0 million, an increase of $191.1 million over fiscal 2022. The increase is primarily a result of increased operating income due to increases in net sales and gross profits, partially offset by higher SG&A expenses. See the definition of Adjusted EBITDA under “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for additional information regarding the definition and use of this metric in evaluating the Company’s results. BACKLOG Although orders from customers can be cancelled at any time without penalty, and unfilled orders are not necessarily an indication of future business, the Company’s unfilled U.S. and Canadian manufacturing orders at April 1, 2023 totaled $308.1 million compared to $1.6 billion at April 2, 2022. The decrease in backlog was primarily driven by lower net orders. Increases in interest rates in response to inflation during this fiscal year has impacted the demand for the Company's products in both the U.S. and Canada. Incoming gross orders from our customers decreased compared to last year. In addition, our independent retail customers have cancelled stock-model orders in response to the increase in floor plan carrying costs and the desire to optimize their model home inventory. Cancellation of end-consumer orders, at the retail level, has been minimal. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The following table presents summary cash flow information for fiscal 2023 and 2022: Year Ended (Dollars in thousands) April 1, 2023 April 2, 2022 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 416,225 $ 224,479 Investing activities (61,179 ) (31,967 ) Financing activities (37,019 ) (19,936 ) Effect of exchange rate changes (5,987 ) 256 Net increase in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash 312,040 172,832 Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash at beginning of period 435,413 262,581 Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash at end of period $ 747,453 $ 435,413 The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and existing cash balances. Cash balances and cash flows from operations for the next year are expected to be adequate to cover working capital requirements, capital expenditures, and strategic initiatives and investments. The Company does not have any scheduled long-term debt maturities in the next twelve months. The Company has an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement which provides for a $200.0 million revolving credit facility, including a $45.0 million letter of credit sub-facility (""Amended Credit Agreement""). At April 1, 2023, there were no borrowings 29 under the Amended Credit Agreement and letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement totaled $32.1 million. Total available borrowings under the Credit Agreement as of April 1, 2023 were $167.9 million. The Company’s revolving credit facility includes (i) a maximum consolidated total net leverage ratio of 3.25 to 1.00, subject to an upward adjustment upon the consummation of a material acquisition, and (ii) a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.00 to 1.00. The Company anticipates compliance with its debt covenants and projects its level of cash availability to be in excess of cash needed to operate the business for the next year and beyond. In the event operating cash flow and existing cash balances were deemed inadequate to support the Company’s liquidity needs, and one or more capital resources were to become unavailable, the Company would revise its operating strategies. Cash provided by operating activities was $416.2 million in fiscal 2023 compared to $224.5 million in fiscal 2022. The majority of the increase in cash provided by operating activities was a result of the $154.8 million increase in net income. However, the change in other working capital items also contributed to higher cash provided by operating activities. Cash required for working capital items increased in fiscal 2022 in response to consumer demand and supply chain issues. Those factors began to normalize in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, requiring less investment and improving cash flow. Cash used in investing activities was $61.2 million in fiscal 2023 versus $32.0 million in fiscal 2022. The increase in the use of cash is related primarily to a $20.3 million increase in purchases of property, plant, and equipment to support the start up of new manufacturing facilities, the acquisition of Manis, and cash paid for an equity method investment. In fiscal 2023, cash used in financing activities was $37.0 million, versus $19.9 million in the prior fiscal year. The increase in cash used for financing activities was related to floor plan financing repayments totaling $35.5 million during fiscal 2023 compared to $17.2 million of net repayments in fiscal 2022 on the revolving debt facility and floor plan financing arrangements. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS Credit Facility The Amended Credit Agreement matures in July 2026 and has no scheduled amortization. The interest rate on borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement is based on either the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (""LIBOR""), or the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (""SOFR"") plus a benchmark Replacement Rate Adjustment (""Replacement Rate""), plus an interest rate spread. The interest rate spread adjusts based on the consolidated total net leverage of the Company from a high of 1.875% when the consolidated total net leverage ratio is equal to or greater than 2.25:1.00, to a low of 1.125% when the consolidated total net leverage is below 0.50:1.00. Alternatively for same day borrowings, the interest rate is based on an Alternative Base Rate (""ABR"") plus an interest rate spread that ranges from a high of 0.875% to a low of 0.125% based on the consolidated total net leverage ratio. In addition, the Company is obligated to pay an unused line fee ranging between 0.15% and 0.30% depending on the consolidated total net leverage ratio, in respect of unused commitments under the Amended Credit Agreement. Letter of Credit Facility The Company has a letter of credit sub-facility under the Amended Credit Agreement. At April 1, 2023, letters of credit issued under the sub-facility totaled $32.1 million. Industrial Revenue Bonds Obligations under industrial revenue bonds are supported by letters of credit and bear interest based on a municipal bond index rate. The industrial revenue bonds require lump-sum payments of principal upon maturity in 2029. Floor Plan Payable At April 1, 2023, the Company had no outstanding borrowings on floor plan financing arrangements. The Company repaid the outstanding balance of $38.5 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The Company’s retail operations historically utilized floor plan financing to fund the acquisition of manufactured homes for display or resale. The arrangements provide for borrowings up to $43.0 million. Floor plan payables are secured by the homes acquired and are required to be repaid when the Company sells the financed home to a customer. 30 Contingent Obligations The Company has contingent liabilities and obligations at April 1, 2023, including surety bonds and letters of credit totaling $31.0 million and $32.1 million, respectively. Additionally, the Company is contingently obligated under repurchase agreements with certain lending institutions that provide floor plan financing to independent retailers. The contingent repurchase obligation as of April 1, 2023 is approximately $386.6 million, without reduction for the resale value of the homes collateralizing the potential repurchases. The Company has the ability to resell the repurchased collateral to other retailers, and losses incurred on repurchased homes have been insignificant in recent periods. The reserve for estimated losses under repurchase agreements was $2.5 million at April 1, 2023. See “ Critical Accounting Polices and Estimates – Reserve for Repurchase Commitments ” below. The Company has provided various representations, warranties, and other standard indemnifications in the ordinary course of its business in agreements to acquire and sell business assets and in financing arrangements. The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of its business. The Company has received claims for damage related to water intrusion in homes built in one of its manufacturing facilities. The Company is investigating the cause of the damage and assessing its responsibility to remediate. While it is reasonably possible that the Company will receive future claims that could result in additional costs to repair that could be significant in the aggregate, the Company is unable to estimate the number of such claims or the amount or range of any potential losses associated with such claims at this time. In the normal course of business, the Company’s subsidiaries historically provided certain parent company guarantees to two U.K. customers. These guarantees provided contractual liability for proven construction defects up to 12 years from the date of delivery of the units. The guarantees remain a contingent liability subsequent to the fiscal 2017 disposition of the U.K. operations, which declines over time through October 2027. As of the date of this report, no claims have been reported under the terms of the guarantees. Management believes the ultimate liability with respect to these contingent obligations will not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES - ADJUSTED EBITDA The Company defines Adjusted Earnings Before Interest Taxes and Depreciation and Amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”) as net income or loss plus expenses or minus income: (a) the provision for income taxes; (b) interest (income) expense, net; (c) depreciation and amortization; (d) gain or loss from discontinued operations; (e) non-cash restructuring charges and impairment of assets; and (f) other non-operating income or expense including but not limited to those costs for the acquisition and integration or disposition of businesses and idle facilities. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of earnings calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income or loss prepared on a U.S. GAAP basis. Adjusted EBITDA does not purport to represent cash flow provided by, or used in, operating activities as defined by U.S. GAAP, which is presented in the Statement of Cash Flows. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is presented as a supplemental measure of the Company’s financial performance that management believes is useful to investors, because the excluded items may vary significantly in timing or amounts and/or may obscure trends useful in evaluating and comparing the Company’s operating activities across reporting periods. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA is useful to an investor in evaluating operating performance for the following reasons: (i) Adjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors to measure a company’s operating performance without regard to items such as interest income and expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization and equity-based compensation, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and the book value of assets, capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired; and (ii) analysts and investors use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to evaluate the overall operating performance of companies in the industry. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA for planning purposes, including the preparation of internal annual operating budget and periodic forecasts: (i) in communications with the Board of Directors and investors concerning financial performance; (ii) as a factor in determining bonuses under certain incentive compensation programs; and (iii) as a measure of operating performance used to determine the ability to provide cash flows to support investments in capital assets, acquisitions and working capital requirements for operating expansion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1, ""Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,"" to the consolidated financial statements included in this Report. Certain of our accounting policies require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Assumptions and estimates of future earnings and cash flow are used in the periodic analyses of the recoverability of goodwill, intangible assets, deferred tax assets and property, plant, and equipment. Historical experience and trends 31 are used to estimate reserves, including reserves for self-insured risks, warranty costs, and wholesale repurchase losses. The Company considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the estimate would have had a significant impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. The Company believes that the following discussion addresses the Company’s critical accounting estimates. Acquisitions We allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the assets and liabilities, if any, is recorded as goodwill. We use all available information to estimate fair values. We typically engage outside appraisal firms to assist in the fair value determination of identifiable intangible assets and any other significant assets or liabilities. We adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation, as necessary, up to one year after the acquisition closing date as we obtain more information regarding asset valuations and liabilities assumed. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but that are inherently uncertain, and therefore, may not be realized. Unanticipated events or circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy of our fair value estimates, including assumptions regarding industry economic factors and business strategies. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the estimates, assumptions, and values reflected in the valuations will be realized, and actual results could vary materially. Reserves for Self-Insured Risks The Company is self-insured for a significant portion of its general insurance, product liability, workers’ compensation, auto, health, and property insurance. Insurance coverage is maintained for catastrophic exposures and those risks required to be insured by law. The Company is liable for the first $150,000 of incurred losses for each workers’ compensation and auto liability claim and is responsible for losses up to the first $500,000 per occurrence for general, product liability, and property insurance. Generally catastrophic losses are insured up to $80 million. The Company establishes reserves for reported and unreported losses and insurance company reimbursements under these programs using an actuarial determined value which takes into consideration prior claim experience, estimates of losses for known occurrences and the respective volume of business activity for a given period. The health plan is currently subject to a stop-loss limit of $600,000 per occurrence. Estimated self-insurance costs are accrued for all expected future expenditures for reported and unreported claims based on historical experience. Warranty Reserves The Company’s factory-built housing operations generally provide each retail homebuyer with a 12-month assurance warranty from the date of retail purchase. Estimated warranty costs are accrued as cost of sales at the time of sale. Warranty provisions and reserves are based on various factors, including estimates of the amounts necessary to settle existing and future claims on homes sold as of the balance sheet date. Factors used in the estimation of the warranty liability include the estimated amount of warranty and customer service costs incurred for homes that remain in retailers’ inventories before delivery to the consumer, homes purchased by consumers still within the warranty period, the timing in which work orders were completed, and the historical average costs incurred to service a home. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets It is the Company’s policy to evaluate the recoverability of property, plant, and equipment whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable, primarily based on estimated selling price, appraised value, or projected undiscounted future cash flows. Impairment of Goodwill Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually. Impairment testing is required more often if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment is more likely than not to have occurred. In conducting its annual impairment testing, the Company may first perform a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount. If not, no further goodwill impairment testing is required. If it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount, or if the Company elects not to perform a qualitative assessment of a reporting unit, the Company then compares the fair value of the reporting unit to the related net book value. If the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is measured and recognized. As the analysis depends upon judgments, estimates and assumptions, such testing is subject to inherent uncertainties, which could cause the fair value to fluctuate from period to period. 32 In fiscal 2023, the Company performed qualitative assessments of its reporting units. The annual assessment was completed on of the first day of fiscal March. The assessments indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded its respective carrying value. The Company does not believe that any reporting units are at risk for impairment. Income Taxes and Deferred Tax Assets Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided when the Company determines that it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Reserve for Repurchase Commitments As is customary in the factory-built housing industry, a significant portion of the home sales to independent retailers are made pursuant to repurchase agreements with lending institutions that provide wholesale floor plan financing to the retailers. Certain homes sold pursuant to repurchase agreements are subject to repurchase, generally up to 24 months after the sale of the home to the retailer. Certain other homes sold pursuant to repurchase agreements are subject to repurchase until the home is sold by the retailer. For those homes with an unlimited repurchase period, the Company’s risk of loss upon repurchase declines due to required monthly principal payments by the retailer. After 18 to 36 months from the date of the Company’s sale of the home, the risk of loss on these homes is low, and by the 46th month, most programs require that the home be paid in full, at which time the Company no longer has risk of loss. Pursuant to these agreements, during the repurchase period, generally upon default by the retailer and repossession by the financial institution, the Company is obligated to repurchase the homes from the floor plan lenders. The contingent repurchase obligation as of April 1, 2023 was estimated to be approximately $386.6 million, without reduction for the resale value of the homes. Losses under repurchase obligations represent the difference between the repurchase price and net proceeds from the resale of the homes, less accrued rebates, which will not be paid. Losses incurred on homes repurchased have been insignificant in recent periods. The reserve for estimated losses under repurchase agreements was $2.5 million at April 1, 2023. OTHER MATTERS Inflation Inflation of raw materials, especially forest products, was significant in fiscal 2022 and 2021, and generally stabilized in fiscal 2023. The raw material price increases have generally been passed on to customers or mitigated through working with supply chain partners, sourcing alternative materials or other operational improvements to minimize the effect on our profitability. However, continued, frequent and sudden increases in specific costs, as well as price competition, can affect the ability to pass on costs and adversely impact results of operations. Therefore, there is no assurance that inflation or the impact of rising material costs will not have a significant impact on revenue or results of operations in the future. Seasonality The housing industry, which includes factory-built homes, is affected by seasonality. Sales during the period from March to November are traditionally higher than other months. As a result, quarterly results of a particular period are not necessarily representative of the results expected for the year. Recently Issued Accounting Standards Refer to Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” in our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding new accounting pronouncements. 33 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITAT IVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Risk Debt obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement are subject to variable rates of interest based on LIBOR, SOFR, or an ABR, at the election of the Company. Changes in interest rates will affect interest payments on outstanding debt balances. At April 1, 2023 there were no outstanding borrowings on the Amended Credit Agreement. Obligations under industrial revenue bonds are subject to variable rates of interest based on a municipal bond index rate. A 100 basis point increase in the underlying interest rates would result in additional annual interest expense of approximately $0.1 million, assuming related debt of $12.4 million, which is the amount of outstanding borrowings on industrial revenue bonds at April 1, 2023. Obligations under floor plan financing arrangements are subject to variable rates of interest based on terms negotiated with the floor plan lenders. Changes in interest rates will affect interest payments on outstanding floor plan balances. At April 1, 2023 there were no outstanding floor plan borrowings. The Company’s approach to interest rate risk is to balance borrowings between fixed rate and variable rate debt as management deems appropriate. At April 1, 2023, the Company’s borrowings under the industrial revenue bonds were at variable rates. Foreign Exchange Risk The Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk with its factory-built housing operations in Canada. The Canadian operations had fiscal 2023 net sales of $189.2 million Canadian dollars. Assuming future annual Canadian net sales equivalent to fiscal 2023, a change of 1.0% in exchange rates between the U.S. and Canadian dollars would change consolidated sales by $1.9 million. The Company also has foreign exchange risk for cash balances maintained in Canadian dollars that are subject to fluctuating values when exchanged into U.S. dollars. The Company does not financially hedge its investment in the Canadian operations or in Canadian denominated bank deposits. ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMEN TS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Financial statements, exhibits and schedules are filed herewith under Item 15. ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCO UNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES The Company’s management, with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of April 1, 2023. Based on that evaluation, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of April 1, 2023. The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, internal controls over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 34 Because of their inherent limitations, the Company's controls and procedures may not prevent or detect misstatements. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all controls systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (""2013 Framework""). Management excluded Factory Expo, which was acquired on July 11, 2022, from its assessment of the internal control over financial reporting. This acquired business comprised approximately 2% of total assets as of April 1, 2023 and approximately 2% of net sales for the year ended April 1, 2023. Based on management's evaluation under the criteria in the 2013 Framework, management concluded that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of April 1, 2023. Ernst & Young LLP, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, audited the Company’s consolidated financial statements set forth in this Annual Report and issued an attestation report regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of April 1, 2023, and the attestation report is set forth in Item 15, ""Financial Statement Schedules,"" under the caption ""Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"" and is incorporated herein by reference. There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended April 1, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at April 1, 2023 and April 2, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the fiscal years ended April 1, 2023, April 2, 2022, and April 3, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of April 1, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated May 30, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts and disclosures to which it relates. Workers’ Compensation Description of the Matter The Company had workers’ compensation reserves of $23.8 million as of April 1, 2023. As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company is self-insured for a significant portion of its workers’ compensation obligations. Workers’ compensation costs are accrued for incurred claims and estimated claims incurred but not yet reported. Auditing the Company’s workers’ compensation reserve is complex and requires the involvement of actuarial specialists due to the measurement uncertainty associated with the estimate of the ultimate loss projection and the use of various actuarial methods. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company’s controls over the workers’ compensation reserve process. For example, we tested controls over management’s F- 2 review of the workers’ compensation reserve calculations, the appropriateness of the assumptions management used in the calculation and controls pertaining to the completeness and accuracy of the claim data underlying the reserve. To evaluate the reserve for workers’ compensation, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, testing the completeness and accuracy of the incurred claims underlying the reserve, obtaining legal confirmation letters to evaluate reserves in consideration of litigated matters, and reviewing the Company’s reinsurance contracts to assess the Company’s self-insurance retentions. Furthermore, we involved our actuarial specialists to assist in our evaluation of methodologies and assumptions applied by management to establish the workers’ compensation reserve. We compared the Company’s reserve to a range developed by our actuarial specialists based on assumptions independently developed by our specialists. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP We have served as the Company‘s auditor since 2006. Detroit, Michigan May 30, 2023 F- 3 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Skyline Champion Corporation Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have audited Skyline Champion Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of April 1, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Skyline Champion Corporation (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of April 1, 2023, based on the COSO criteria. As indicated in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management’s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Factory Expo, which is included in the 2023 consolidated financial statements of the Company and constituted approximately 2% of total assets as of April 1, 2023 and approximately 2% of revenues for the fiscal year then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Factory Expo. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of April 1, 2023 and April 2, 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the fiscal years ended April 1, 2023, April 2, 2022, and April 3, 2021, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) and our report dated May 30, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

See accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. F- 10 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Nature of Operations: The Company’s operations consist of manufacturing, retail, construction services, and transportation activities. At April 1, 2023 , the Company operated 38 manufacturing facilities throughout the United States (“U.S.”) and five manufacturing facilities in western Canada that primarily construct factory-built, timber-framed manufactured and modular houses that are sold primarily to independent retailers, builders/developers, and manufactured home community operators. The Company’s retail operations consist of 31 sales centers that sell manufactured houses to consumers throughout the U.S. The Company’s transportation business engages independent owners/drivers to transport recreational vehicles throughout the U.S. and Canada and manufactured houses in certain regions of the U.S. The Company also has a holding company located in the Netherlands. Principles of Consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Accounting Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“US. GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto. Estimates made in preparing the accompanying consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, business combinations, reserves for obsolete inventory, accrued warranty costs, useful lives of fixed and intangible assets, asset impairment analyses, insurance reserves, legal reserves, repurchase reserves, share-based compensation and deferred tax valuation allowances. Actual results could differ from those estimates, making it reasonably possible that a change in these estimates could occur within one year. Fiscal Year: The Company’s fiscal year is a 52- or 53-week period that ends on the Saturday nearest March 31. Fiscal 2023 and 2022 include the 52-weeks ended April 1, 2023 and April 2, 2022, respectively. Fiscal 2021 includes the 53-weeks ended April 3, 2021 . Revenue Recognition: Revenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of a contract are satisfied which generally occurs at a point in time through the transfer of control of promised goods to the Company's customers. Control transfers once a customer has the ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the benefits from, the product. This includes the transfer of legal title, physical possession, the risks and rewards of ownership, and customer acceptance. Sales revenue is reported net of applicable sales tax. See Note 8, Revenue Recognition, for additional information. Cost of Sales: Cost of sales includes manufacturing costs such as: (i) materials; (ii) compensation and employee benefits for direct and indirect labor; (iii) fixed and variable manufacturing overhead costs; (iv) warranty costs; (v) inbound delivery costs; and (vi) depreciation of buildings and equipment. Manufacturing overhead costs include costs such as: (i) utilities; (ii) workers’ compensation and product liability self-insurance; (iii) real and personal property taxes on buildings and equipment; (iv) manufacturing supplies; (v) repairs and maintenance; and (vi) rents and leases for buildings and equipment. Cost of sales also includes certain post-manufacturing costs, to the extent such costs are the Company’s responsibility. Post-manufacturing costs may include delivery and setup, foundations, craning, roofing, exterior cladding, interior finishing, utility connections and other miscellaneous site costs. Generally, subcontractors are engaged to perform post-manufacturing activities. Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses: Selling, general, and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) include costs such as (i) salaries, wages, incentives and employee benefits for executive, management, sales, engineering, accounting, information technology (“IT”) and administrative employees; (ii) sales commissions; (iii) marketing and advertising costs; (iv) legal and professional fees; (v) depreciation, rents and leases for administrative facilities, office equipment, IT equipment and computer software; and (vi) postage, office supplies, travel and telephone expenses. Advertising Costs and Delivery Costs and Revenue : Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and are included in selling, general, and administrative expenses. Total advertising expense was approximately $ 3.6 million , $ 1.8 million , and $ 1.7 million for fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021 , respectively. Delivery costs are included in cost of sales and delivery revenue is included in net sales. Foreign Currency: Translation adjustments of the Company’s international subsidiaries for which the local currency is the functional currency are reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. F air Value: The Company estimates the fair value of its financial instruments in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement , which establishes a fair value hierarchy and requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. As such, the fair value of financial instruments is estimated using available market information and other valuation methods. F- 11 The Company groups assets and liabilities at fair value in three levels, based on the inputs and assumptions used to determine fair value. These levels are: The Company records accounts receivable, accounts payable and other current liabilities at cost. The carrying value of these instruments approximate their fair value due to their short-term maturities. Cash and Cash Equivalents : Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments that have original maturities less than 90 days at the time of their purchase. These investments are carried at cost, which approximates market value because of their short maturities. Allowance for Credit Losses: The Company extends credit terms on a customer-by-custo mer basis in the normal course of business and, as such, trade accounts receivable are subject to customary credit risk. The Company’s allowance for credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost reflects management’s estimate of credit losses over the remaining expected life of such assets, measured primarily using historical experience, as well as current economic conditions and forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. Expected credit losses for newly recognized financial assets, as well as changes to expected credit losses during the period, are recognized in earnings. At both April 1, 2023 and April 2, 2022, accounts receivable were reflected net of reserves of $ 1.7 million . Inventories : Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost determined under the first-in, first-out method. Capitalized manufacturing costs include the cost of materials, labor and manufacturing overhead. Retail inventories of new manufactured homes built by the Company are valued at manufacturing cost, including materials, labor and manufacturing overhead, or net purchase price if acquired from unaffiliated third parties. Property, Plant, and Equipment : Property, plant, and equipment are stated at acquisition date cost. Depreciation is provided principally on the straight-line method, generally over the following estimated useful lives: land improvements— 3 to 10 years ; buildings and improvements— 8 to 25 years ; and vehicles and machinery and equipment— 3 to 8 years . At April 1, 2023 , the Company owned or leased eight i dle manufacturing facilities. The net book value of idle facilities was $ 10.5 million at April 1, 2023. These properties are accounted for as long-lived assets to be held and used. It is the Company’s policy to evaluate the recoverability of property, plant, and equipment whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable. If impairment indicators exist, the Company performs the required impairment analysis by comparing the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the long-lived assets to the related net book values. If the net book value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is measured and recognized. An impairment loss is measured as the difference between the net book value and the fair value of the long-lived assets. Fair value is estimated based upon a combination of market and cost approaches, as appropriate. No impairment losses were recorded in fiscal 2023, 2022, or 2021. Leases: The Company has operating leases for land, manufacturing and office facilities, and equipment. The Company’s lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such option. The Company's leases do not contain material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease terms. The Company has elected not to recognize any right of use asset or lease liability for leases with an initial term of 12 months or less and has elected not to separate lease and non-lease components. The discount rate used to measure a lease obligation should be the rate implicit in the lease; however, the Company’s operating leases generally do not provide an implicit rate. Accordingly, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate at lease commencement to determine the present value of lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is an entity-specific rate which represents the rate of interest a lessee would pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term with similar payments. Assets held for sale: Long-lived assets expected to be sold or otherwise disposed of within one year are classified as assets held for sale and included in other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company had no assets classified as held for sale at April 1, 2023 and April 2, 2022. Goodwill : The Company tests goodwill for impairment in accordance with ASC 350. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment on at least an annual basis. Impairment testing is required more often than annually if an event or circumstance indicates F- 12 that an impairment is more likely than not to have occurred. In conducting its annual impairment testing, the Company may first perform a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount. If not, no further goodwill impairment testing is required. If it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount, or if the Company elects not to perform a qualitative assessment of a reporting unit, the Company then compares the fair value of the reporting unit to the related net book value. If the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is measured and recognized. In fiscal 2023 , the Company performed qualitative assessments of its reporting units. The annual assessment was completed on the first day of fiscal March. The assessment indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded its respective carrying value. The Company does not believe that any reporting units are at risk for impairment. Business combinations: The Company accounts for its business combinations in accordance with the accounting guidance in ASC 805. The purchase price of an acquired business is allocated to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the assets and liabilities, if any, is recorded as goodwill. Determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management’s judgment, the utilization of independent appraisal firms and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the timing and amount of future cash flows, market rate assumptions, actuarial assumptions, and appropriate discount rates, among other items. In May 2022, the Company acquired certain operating assets from Manis Custom Builders, Inc. (""Manis""). In July 2022, the Company acquired 12 Factory Expo retail sales centers from Alta Cima Corporation. The purchase price and net assets acquired for both transactions were not material to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. Amortizable Intangible Assets : Amortizable intangible assets consist primarily of fair values assigned to customer relationships and trade names. Trade names were valued based upon the relief-from-royalty method and customer relationships were valued based upon the multi-period excess earnings method. Amortization is provided over the useful lives of the intangible assets, generally up to ten years , using the straight-line method. The recoverability of amortizable intangible assets is evaluated whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recovered, in accordance with the recognition and measurement provisions of ASC 360. Unconsolidated affiliates: The Company analyzes its investments in non-wholly owned subsidiaries to determine whether they are unconsolidated affiliates, consolidated affiliates, or variable interest entities (“VIEs”) and, if so, whether the Company is the primary beneficiary in accordance with ASC 810 Consolidation. If the Company is determined to be the primary beneficiary, it must consolidate the VIE. In determining whether it is the primary beneficiary, the Company considers whether it has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance. The Company also considers whether it has the obligation to absorb losses of, or the right to receive benefits from, the VIE. The Company uses the equity method to account for its investment in a variable interest entity made in fiscal 2023 in which the Company is not deemed to be th e primary beneficiary. The Company's net investment in its unconsolidated affiliate was $ 2.5 million at April 1, 2023. Warranty Obligations : The Company’s manufactured housing operations generally provides the homebuyer with an assurance warranty from the date of respective purchase. Estimated warranty costs are accrued as cost of sales at the time of sale. Warranty provisions and reserves are based on estimates of the amounts necessary to settle existing and future claims on homes sold by the manufacturing segment as of the balance sheet date. Factors used to calculate the warranty obligation include the estimated number of homes still under warranty, the timing of workorder completion, and the historical average costs incurred to service a home. Dealer Volume Rebates : The Company’s manufacturing operations sponsors volume rebate programs under which sales to retailers and builder/developers can qualify for cash rebates generally based on the level of sales attained during a twelve-month period. Volume rebates are accrued at the time of sale and are recorded as a reduction of net sales. Repurchase Agreements: The Company is contingently liable under terms of repurchase agreements with lending institutions that provide wholesale floor plan financing to retailers. These arrangements, which are customary in the industry, provide for the repurchase of products sold to retailers in the event of default by the retailer on their agreement to pay the financial institution. The risk of loss from these agreements is spread over numerous retailers. The repurchase price is generally determined by the original sales price of the product less contractually defined curtailment payments. The Company accounts for the guarantee under its repurchase agreements with the retailers’ financing institutions by estimating and deferring a portion of the related product sale that represents the estimated fair value of the guarantee. Accrued Self-Insurance : The Company is self-insured for a significant portion of its workers’ compensation, general and product liability, auto liability, health, and property insurance. Insurance coverage is maintained for catastrophic exposures and those risks required to be insured by law. Estimated self-insurance costs are accrued for incurred claims and estimated claims incurred but not yet reported. At April 1, 2023 and April 2, 2022, the Company had gross reserves for estimated losses related to workers’ compensation obligations of $ 23.8 million and $ 19.8 million, respectively. The Company also recorded expected reimbursements for F- 13 the portion of those losses above respective program limits of $ 11.0 millio n and $ 7.4 million at April 1, 2023 and April 2, 2022 , respectively. Equity-Based Compensation: Stock-based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is generally recognized as expense ratably on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. Forfeitures are recognized in the period in which they occur. Comprehensive Income and Loss: Components of comprehensive income and loss are changes in equity other than those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners. The aggregate amount of such changes to equity that have not yet been recognized in net income or loss are reported in the equity section of the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, net of tax. Income Taxes : The provision for income taxes is calculated using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent upon the generation of future taxable income. In determining the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns, judgment is required. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Pending Adoption: There were no accounting standards recently issued that are expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations. The components of inventory, net of reserves for obsolete inventory, were as follows: (Dollars in thousands) April 1, 2023 April 2, 2022 Raw materials $ 100,379 $ 141,238 Work in process 23,157 26,523 Finished goods and other 78,702 73,573 Total inventories $ 202,238 $ 241,334 At April 1, 2023 and April 2, 2022, reserves for obsolete inventory were $ 7.9 million and $ 4.8 million , respectively. The components of property, plant, and equipment were as follows: (Dollars in thousands) April 1, 2023 April 2, 2022 Land and improvements $ 41,749 $ 39,815 Buildings and improvements 119,226 104,085 Machinery and equipment 91,007 69,518 Construction in progress 30,010 10,280 Property, plant, and equipment, at cost 281,992 223,698 Less accumulated depreciation ( 104,867 ) ( 90,713 ) Property, plant, and equipment, net $ 177,125 $ 132,985 Depreciation expense for the fiscal years ended April 1, 2023, April 2, 2022, and April 3, 2021 was $ 16.1 million , $ 13.4 million , and $ 12.1 million , respectively. Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. At April 1, 2023 and April 2, 2022, the Company had goodwill of $ 196.6 million and $ 192.0 million , respectively. Goodwill is allocated to reporting units included in the U.S. Factory-built Housing segment, which include the Company’s U.S. manufacturing and retail operations. The change in the goodwill balance for fiscal 2023 was the result of acquisitions during the period. At April 1, 2023 there are no accumulated impairment losses related to goodwill. F- 14 Intangible Assets The components of amortizable intangible assets were as follows: (Dollars in thousands) April 1, 2023 April 2, 2022 Customer Relationships & Other Trade Names Total Customer Relationships & Other Trade Names Total Gross carrying amount $ 66,013 $ 21,497 $ 87,510 $ 61,986 $ 21,419 $ 83,405 Accumulated amortization ( 32,103 ) ( 10,064 ) ( 42,167 ) ( 23,819 ) ( 8,303 ) ( 32,122 ) Amortizable intangibles, net $ 33,910 $ 11,433 $ 45,343 $ 38,167 $ 13,116 $ 51,283 Weighted average remaining amortization period, in years 5.4 6.3 5.6 6.8 6.9 6.8 Amortization of intangible assets for the fiscal years ended April 1, 2023, April 2, 2022, and April 3, 2021 was $ 10.6 million , $ 7.6 million , and $ 5.6 million respectively. Estimated amortization expense of intangible assets over the next five years is estimated to be (dollars in thousands): Fiscal 2024 $ 8,613 Fiscal 2025 7,388 Fiscal 2026 7,388 Fiscal 2027 7,346 Fiscal 2028 7,317 Cloud Computing Arrangements The Company capitalizes costs associated with the development of cloud computing arrangements in a manner consistent with internally developed software. At April 1, 2023 and April 2, 2022, the Company had capitalized cloud computing costs of $ 25.0 million and $ 20.5 million, respectively. Cloud computing costs are included in other noncurrent assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Amortization of capitalized cloud computing costs was $ 0.8 million and $ 0.2 million for the fiscal year ended April 1, 2023 and April 2, 2022. The components of other current liabilities were as follows: (Dollars in thousands) April 1, 2023 April 2, 2022 Customer deposits $ 69,285 $ 67,396 Accrued volume rebates 25,084 23,505 Accrued warranty obligations 28,576 25,806 Accrued compensation and payroll taxes 41,422 64,888 Accrued insurance 15,075 13,569 Other 24,773 27,329 Total other current liabilities $ 204,215 $ 222,493 Changes in the accrued warranty obligations were as follows: Year Ended (Dollars in thousands) April 1, 2023 April 2, 2022 Balance at the beginning of the period $ 32,832 $ 30,469 Warranty expense 54,021 43,314 Cash warranty payments ( 50,892 ) ( 40,951 ) Balance at end of period 35,961 32,832 Less noncurrent portion in other long-term liabilities ( 7,385 ) ( 7,026 ) Total current portion $ 28,576 $ 25,806 F- 15 Long-term debt consisted of the following: (Dollars in thousands) April 1, 2023 April 2, 2022 Obligations under industrial revenue bonds due 2029 $ 12,430 $ 12,430 Revolving credit facility maturing in 2026 — — Total long-term debt $ 12,430 $ 12,430 On July 7, 2021, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with a syndicate of banks that provides for a revolving credit facility of up to $ 200.0 million, including a $ 45.0 million letter of credit sub-facility (“Amended Credit Agreement”). The Amended Credit Agreement replaced the Company’s previously existing $ 100.0 million revolving credit facility. Outstanding borrowings of $ 26.9 million on the Company’s previous revolving credit facility were repaid in July 2021. The Amended Credit Agreement allows the Company to draw down, repay and re-draw loans on the available funds during the term, subject to certain terms and conditions, matures in July 2026 and has no scheduled amortization. The Company capitalized $ 1.1 million of deferred financing fees associated with the Amended Credit Agreement, which is included in other noncurrent assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The Company wrote off $ 0.3 million of deferred financing fees associated with the previously existing credit facility, which is included in interest expense, net in fiscal 2022. The interest rate on borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement is based on either LIBOR, or SOFR plus a Replacement Rate, plus an interest rate spread. The interest rate spread adjusts based on the consolidated total net leverage of the Company from a high of 1.875 % when the consolidated total net leverage ratio is equal to or greater than 2.25 :1.00, to a low of 1.125 % when the consolidated total net leverage ratio is below 0.50:1.00. Alternatively for same day borrowings, the interest rate is based on ABR plus an interest rate spread that ranges from a high of 0.875 % to a low of 0.125 % based on the consolidated total net leverage ratio. In addition, the Company is obligated to pay an unused line fee ranging between 0.15 % and 0.3 % depending on the consolidated total net leverage ratio, in respect of unused commitments under the Amended Credit Agreement. At April 1, 2023 the interest rate under the Credit Agreement was 6.04 % and letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement totaled $ 32.1 million . Total available borrowings under the Credit Agreement were $ 167.9 million. Obligations under industrial revenue bonds are supported by letters of credit and bear interest based on a municipal bond index rate. The weighted-average interest rate at April 1, 2023 and April 2, 2022, including related costs and fees, was 5.76 % and 2.18 %, respectively. The industrial revenue bonds require lump-sum payments of principal upon maturity in 2029 and are secured by the assets of certain manufacturing facilities. The Amended Credit Agreement contains covenants that restrict the amount of additional debt, liens and certain payments, including equity buybacks, investments, dispositions, mergers and consolidations, among other restrictions as defined. The Company was in compliance with all covenants of the Amended Credit Agreement as of April 1, 2023. Floor Plan Payable The Company’s retail operations historically utilized floor plan financing to fund the acquisition of manufactured homes for display or resale. At April 2, 2022, the Company had outstanding borrowings on floor plan financing agreements of $ 35.5 million. All outstanding borrowings were repaid in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 and there were no outstanding borrowings at April 1, 2023. The financing arrangements allow for borrowings up to $ 43.0 million. Borrowings are secured by the homes and are required to be repaid when the Company sells the home to a customer. The Company’s revenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of a contract are satisfied which generally occurs with the transfer of control of products. The Company enters into contracts with its customers to provide manufactured homes, modular homes, park model RVs, ADUs, commercial structures and transportation services. Generally, the Company’s contracts may be terminated by the Company’s customers at any time prior to initiation of construction of the respective home. Historically, terminations of these contracts have been minimal. The Company receives signed sales quotes from its customers, which provide the terms for a specific home, including price. The Company also has agreements with certain customers that provide for certain variable consideration, such as volume discounts, that are deducted from the contract price and accrued at the time of sale. In certain situations, the Company may receive payment in advance of completion of its contractual obligations. In these situations, the arising contract liability is classified within customer deposits and receipts in excess of revenues. Following the receipt of the customer deposit, the Company typically completes its performance obligation within a twelve-month period. F- 16 For sales to independent wholesale customers, revenue is recognized at the point in time when wholesale floor plan financing or retailer credit approval has been received, the home has shipped and title has transferred, which occurs when the Company has satisfied its contractual obligations and the control of its products has been transferred. The Company does not have an enforceable right to payment prior to shipment. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration that the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those products. The Company’s customers pay for products received in accordance with payment terms that are customary within the industry. As is customary in the factory-built housing industry, a significant portion of the Company’s sales to independent retailers are financed under floor plan financing programs with certain third-party lenders. Floor plan financing arrangements are generally identified prior to shipment of products and payment for sales financed under floor plan programs is generally received 5 to 10 business days from the date of invoice. For retail sales to consumers from Company-owned retail sales centers, revenue is recognized when the home has been delivered, set up and accepted by the consumer, and title has transferred. The Company recognizes revenue and related cost of sales for long-term construction contracts (“Commercial”) over time as performance obligations are satisfied using the percentage-of-completion method (input method). Management estimates the stage of completion on each construction project based on progress and costs incurred. Unbilled revenue on long-term construction contracts are classified as a contract asset in accounts receivable. Receipts in excess of billings are classified as contract liabilities and included in other current liabilities. At April 2, 2022 uncollected billings related to long-term construction contracts totaled $ 1.4 million. There were no uncollected billings related to long-term construction contracts at April 1, 2023 and no unbilled revenue or receipts in excess of billings for long-term contracts at either April 1, 2023 or April 2, 2022. Revenue for the Company’s transportation operations is recognized when a shipment has been delivered to its final destination. Amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling costs are included in net sales. Shipping and handling costs are accounted for as fulfillment costs and are included in cost of sales.

F- 19 Deferred tax assets and liabilities at April 1, 2023 and April 2, 2022 consisted of the following: (Dollars in thousands) April 1, 2023 April 2, 2022 ASSETS Warranty reserves $ 8,889 $ 8,043 Intangible assets 8,763 9,833 Lease assets 7,487 2,774 Employee compensation 7,320 12,042 Foreign net operating loss carryforwards 6,343 6,470 Self-insurance reserves 5,851 5,396 Equity-based compensation 3,258 2,206 Dealer volume discounts 2,749 2,077 Inventory reserves and impairments 2,599 1,750 Other 3,987 6,032 Gross deferred tax assets $ 57,246 $ 56,623 LIABILITIES Property, plant, and equipment $ 13,367 $ 9,901 Lease liabilities 7,487 2,774 Intangible assets 5,974 7,834 Foreign tax basis difference in investments 5,964 5,124 Other 958 5,623 Gross deferred tax liabilities 33,750 31,256 Valuation allowance ( 12,038 ) ( 12,741 ) Net deferred tax assets $ 11,458 $ 12,626 The Company anticipates periodically repatriating the earnings of its Netherlands and Canadian subsidiaries. A deferred tax liability is recognized for income tax withholding which may be incurred upon the reversal of basis differences in investments in its foreign subsidiaries. The Company periodically evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets based on whether it is “more likely than not” that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Our evaluation considers available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit use of the existing deferred tax assets. The Company’s valuation allowance principally consists of valuation allowances for certain state NOL carryforwards, certain Canadian deferred tax assets, and the Company’s deferred tax assets in the Netherlands. As of April 1, 2023 , the Company has state NOL carryforwards in various jurisdictions which expire primarily in 2023 through 2042 . Unrecognized tax benefits represent the differences between tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return and the benefits recognized for financial statement purposes. There were no unrecognized tax benefits at April 1, 2023 and April 2, 2022. The Company is no longer subject to foreign tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to fiscal 2019. The Company’s U.S. subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal tax examinations for fiscal 2020 through fiscal 2023 , and U.S. state tax examinations by tax authorities for fiscal 2019 through fiscal 2023. The Company has equity incentive plans under which the Company has been authorized to grant share-based awards to key employees and non-employee directors. Equity-based compensation expense of $ 14.2 million, $ 9.8 million, and $ 6.0 million, was recognized in fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Equity-based compensation expense is included in SG&A expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. The total associated income tax benefit recognized was $ 3.3 million , $ 2.8 million, and $ 1.0 million in fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Total unrecognized equity-based compensation for all share-based awards was $ 29.8 million at April 1, 2023 , of which $ 13.1 million is expected to be recognized in fiscal 2024, $ 10.4 million in fiscal 2025, and $ 6.3 million thereafter, or a weighted-average period of 1.77 ye ars. F- 20 Time-Vesting and Performance-Vesting Restricted Share Awards The Company granted awards to its officers, management employees, and certain members of the Board of Managers under an equity-classified management incentive plan (the “MIP”). In accordance with the provisions of the MIP, as modified on June 1, 2018, unvested units granted under the MIP were exchanged for unregistered, time-vesting restricted shares and performance-vesting restricted shares of the Company subject to stock restriction agreements (the “SRAs”). The exchange was accounted for as a modification. The fair value of the awards that vested during fiscal 2021 was $ 4.2 million. A summary of the activity associated with these awards is as follows, there was no activity in fiscal 2022 or 2023. (amounts in thousands) Time Based Restricted Share Awards Outstanding at March 28, 2020 145 Vested ( 145 ) Outstanding at April 3, 2021 — On September 26, 2018, the Company’s shareholders approved the Company’s 2018 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Equity Plan”) which provides for grants of options, stock appreciation rights, restricted and unrestricted stock and stock units, performance awards, and other awards convertible into or otherwise based on shares of the Company’s common stock. General terms and methods of valuation for the Company’s share-based awards granted under the Equity Plan are described below. Stock Options Stock options generally have terms of 10 years, with one-third of each grant vesting each year for three years , and are assigned an exercise price that is equal to or greater than the closing market price of a share of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. When determining expected volatility, the Company considered volatility of guideline public companies. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant, based on the options’ expected term. The expected term of the options is based on the time period to exercise for each vesting tranche, which is calculated based on the average of: (i) the full option contractual term; and (ii) the starting vest date. There were no stock options granted in fiscal 2023. A summary of the activity associated with these awards is as follows: Shares (in thousands) Weighted Average Exercise Price Per Share Weighted Average Remaining Term (in years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value (in thousands) Outstanding at March 28, 2020 403 $ 26.29 Granted 138 $ 31.21 Exercised ( 5 ) $ 15.00 Outstanding at April 3, 2021 536 $ 27.50 Granted 13 $ 53.06 Exercised ( 61 ) $ 25.04 Forfeitures ( 1 ) $ 31.68 Outstanding at April 2, 2022 487 $ 28.50 Exercised ( 89 ) $ 27.64 Outstanding at April 1, 2023 398 $ 28.68 6.7 $ 18,525 Vested and expected to vest at April 1, 2023 398 $ 28.68 6.7 $ 18,525 Exercisable at April 1, 2023 343 $ 27.97 6.5 $ 16,223 F- 21 The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model along with the weighted average grant date fair value for awards granted in the periods presented are as follows: Option Award Assumptions Fiscal 2022 Fiscal 2021 Weighted-average assumptions used: Expected volatility 50.0 % 45.0 % Dividend yield — — Risk-free interest rate 1.0 % 0.5 % Expected term, in years 6.00 6.00 Weighted average grant date fair value per share $ 25.29 $ 12.48 Performance Share Units In fiscal 2023 and 2022, the Company issued performance share units that contain market vesting conditions, performance vesting conditions, and service conditions. The performance condition is based on the Company's market share of single family home completions (""SFC Market Share""). The SFC Market Share component of the awards are valued at the market price of a share of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. The market condition is based on the Company’s total shareholder return (“TSR”) compared to the median TSR of certain companies over a three year performance period. The Company used a Monte-Carlo simulation to determine the grant date fair value for the awards, which takes into consideration the possible outcomes pertaining to the TSR market condition. Per the terms of the awards, 0 % to 200 % of the Company’s performance share units vest on the third anniversary of the vesting commencement date based upon achievement of the performance and market conditions as specified in the performance share unit agreement. In fiscal 2021 , the Company issued performance share units that contain market vesting conditions and service conditions. The market condition is based on the Company’s TSR compared to the median TSR of certain companies over a three year performance period. The Company used a Monte-Carlo simulation to determine the grant date fair value for the awards. Per the terms of the awards, 0 % to 150 % of the Company’s performance share units vest on the third anniversary of the vesting commencement date based upon achievement of the market condition as specified in the performance share unit agreement. A summary of the activity associated with these awards based on the maximum potential achievement is as follows: Shares (in thousands, Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Per Unit, at maximum achievement) (at maximum achievement) Outstanding at March 28, 2020 345 $ 9.23 Granted 92 $ 18.92 Outstanding at April 3, 2021 437 $ 11.27 Granted 188 $ 42.23 Vested ( 84 ) $ 6.38 Forfeitures ( 134 ) $ 3.01 Outstanding at April 2, 2022 407 $ 29.26 Granted 254 $ 42.17 Vested ( 128 ) $ 33.22 Forfeitures ( 3 ) $ 35.88 Outstanding at April 1, 2023 530 $ 26.20 The assumptions used in the Monte-Carlo simulation for the performance condition of performance share units along with the weighted-average grant date fair value for awards granted in the periods presented are as follows: Performance Unit Assumptions Fiscal 2023 Fiscal 2022 Fiscal 2021 Weighted-average assumptions used: Expected volatility 57.6 % 54.8 % 50.0 % Dividend yield — — — Risk-free interest rate 3.7 % 1.1 % 2.0 % Expected term, in years 3.00 2.98 3.00 Weighted average grant date fair value per share $ 84.34 $ 83.04 $ 28.38 Restricted Stock Units Restricted stock units are valued at the market price of a share of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. In general, these awards have graded vesting conditions in which a portion of awards vest ratably in three equal installments on the anniversary of F- 22 the vesting commencement date. The total fair value of restricted stock which vested was approximately $ 4.9 million, $ 8.0 million, and $ 2.5 million during fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The weighted average grant date fair value for restricted stock units granted in fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021 wa s $ 61.92 , $ 67.90 , and $ 28.33 , respectively. (units and shares in thousands) Restricted Stock Units Outstanding at March 30, 2019 194 Granted 87 Forfeitures ( 98 ) Outstanding at April 3, 2021 183 Granted 109 Vested ( 126 ) Forfeitures ( 1 ) Outstanding at April 2, 2022 165 Granted 267 Vested ( 91 ) Forfeitures ( 11 ) Outstanding at April 1, 2023 330 Basic net income per share (“EPS”) attributable to the Company was computed by dividing net income attributable to the Company by the average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Certain of the Company’s time-vesting restricted share awards are considered participating securities. Diluted earnings per common share is computed based on the more dilutive of: (i) the two-class method, assuming the participating securities are not exercised or converted; or (ii) the treasury stock method. During fiscal 2021, the two-class method was more dilutive. The two-class method was not applicable to the computation for fiscal 2023 or 2022 as the time-vested restricted share awards were fully vested and no longer considered participating securities. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share: Year Ended (Dollars and shares in thousands, except per share data) April 1, 2023 April 2, 2022 April 3, 2021 Numerator: Net income $ 401,802 $ 248,044 $ 84,899 Undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities — — ( 77 ) Net income attributable to the Company's common shareholders $ 401,802 $ 248,044 $ 84,822 Denominator: Basic weighted average shares outstanding 56,987 56,816 56,648 Dilutive securities 408 490 325 Diluted weighted average shares outstanding 57,395 57,306 56,973 Basic net income per share: $ 7.05 $ 4.37 $ 1.50 Diluted net income per share: $ 7.00 $ 4.33 $ 1.49 Securities that could potentially dilute basic EPS in the future that were considered antidilutive in the periods presented are shown below: Type of security (in thousands) April 1, 2023 April 2, 2022 April 3, 2021 Stock options 13 11 358 Restricted share units - 20 - Performance share units 93 20 - Total dilutive securities 106 51 358 The Company’s U.S. subsidiary sponsors a defined contribution savings plan covering most U.S. employees. Full-time employees covered by the plan are eligible to participate. Participating employees may contribute from 1 % to 25 % of their F- 23 compensation to the plan, with the Company matching 50 % of the first 6 % of pay contributed. The Company match vests after three years of employment or immediately for employees age 50 and over. The Company recognized expense o f $ 5.9 million , $ 4.2 million , and $ 2.6 million related to this plan during fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Full-time employees of the Company’s subsidiaries in Canada are generally covered by employer-sponsored defined contribution plans that require employee contributions and employer matching contributions. The Company recognized expense of $ 0.7 million in both fiscal 2023 and 2022 and $ 0.5 million in fiscal 2021 . Financial results for the Company's reportable segments have been prepared using a management approach, which is consistent with the basis and manner in which financial information is evaluated by the Company's chief operating decision maker in allocating resources and in assessing performance. The Company’s chief operating decision maker, the Chief Executive Officer, evaluates the performance of the Company’s segment primarily based on net sales, before elimination of inter-company shipments, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) and operating assets. The Company operates in two reportable segments: (i) U.S. Factory-built Housing, which includes manufacturing and retail housing operations and (ii) Canadian Factory-built Housing. Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation operations, corporate costs directly incurred for all segments and intersegment eliminations. Segments are generally determined by geography. Segment data includes intersegment revenues and corporate office costs that are directly and exclusively incurred for each segment. Total assets for Corporate/Other primarily include cash and certain deferred tax items not specifically allocated to another segment. F- 24 Selected financial information by reportable segment was as follows: Year Ended (Dollars in thousands) April 1, 2023 April 2, 2022 April 3, 2021 Net sales: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 2,411,342 $ 1,991,066 $ 1,266,308 Canadian Factory-built Housing 144,289 159,124 101,328 Corporate/Other 50,929 57,039 53,245 Consolidated net sales $ 2,606,560 $ 2,207,229 $ 1,420,881 Operating income: U.S. Factory-built Housing EBITDA $ 558,988 $ 360,978 $ 142,699 Canadian Factory-built Housing EBITDA 32,937 31,692 19,564 Corporate/Other EBITDA ( 46,280 ) ( 38,793 ) ( 29,911 ) Other income ( 634 ) ( 36 ) ( 5,889 ) Depreciation ( 16,085 ) ( 13,384 ) ( 12,087 ) Amortization ( 10,641 ) ( 7,552 ) ( 5,617 ) Consolidated operating income $ 518,285 $ 332,905 $ 108,759 Depreciation: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 13,624 $ 10,823 $ 9,620 Canadian Factory-built Housing 1,228 1,111 860 Corporate/Other 1,233 1,450 1,607 Consolidated depreciation $ 16,085 $ 13,384 $ 12,087 Amortization of U.S. Factory-built Housing intangible assets: $ 10,641 $ 7,552 $ 5,617 Capital expenditures: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 47,328 $ 29,133 $ 6,261 Canadian Factory-built Housing 4,189 1,419 1,034 Corporate/Other 727 1,427 721 Consolidated capital expenditures $ 52,244 $ 31,979 $ 8,016 (Dollars in thousands) April 1, 2023 April 2, 2022 Total Assets: U.S. Factory-built Housing (1) $ 708,573 $ 695,500 Canadian Factory-built Housing (1) 124,673 107,459 Corporate/Other (1) 729,478 431,660 Consolidated total assets $ 1,562,724 $ 1,234,619 F- 25 Repurchase Contingencies and Guarantees The Company is contingently liable under terms of repurchase agreements with lending institutions that provide wholesale floor plan financing to retailers. These arrangements, which are customary in the manufactured housing industry, provide for the repurchase of products sold to retailers in the event of default by the retailer on their agreement to pay the financial institution. The risk of loss from these agreements is significantly reduced by the potential resale value of any products that are subject to repurchase and is spread over numerous retailers. The repurchase price is generally determined by the original sales price of the product less contractually defined curtailment payments. Based on these repurchase agreements and our historical loss experience, we establish an associated loss reserve which was $ 2.5 million and $ 2.3 million at April 1, 2023 and April 2, 2022, respectively. Excluding the resale value of the homes, the contingent repurchase obligation as of April 1, 2023 was estimated to be approximately $ 386.6 million . Losses incurred on homes repurchased were immaterial during each of the fiscal years ended April 1, 2023, April 2, 2022, and April 3, 2021. At April 1, 2023, the Company was contingently obligated for approximately $ 32.1 million under letters of credit, primarily consisting of $ 12.6 million to support long-term debt, $ 19.2 million to support the casualty insurance program, and $ 0.3 million to support bonding agreements. The letters of credit are issued under a sub-facility of the Credit Agreement. The Company was also contingently obligated for $ 31.0 million under surety bonds, which generally support performance on long-term construction contracts and license and service bonding requirements. The Company has received claims for damage related to water intrusion in homes built in one of its manufacturing facilities. The Company is investigating the cause of the damage and assessing its responsibility to remediate. While it is reasonably possible that the Company will receive future claims that could result in additional costs to repair that could be significant in the aggregate, the Company is unable to estimate the number of such claims or the amount or range of any potential losses associated with such claims at this time. In the normal course of business, the Company’s former subsidiaries that operated in the United Kingdom historically provided certain guarantees to two customers. Those guarantees provide contractual liability for proven construction defects up to 12 years from the date of delivery of certain products. The guarantees remain a contingent liability of the Company which declines over time through October 2027. As of the date of this report, the Company expects few, if any, claims to be reported under the terms of the guarantees. Legal Proceedings The Company has agreed to indemnify counterparties in the ordinary course of its business in agreements to acquire and sell business assets and in financing arrangements. The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of its business. As of the date of this filing, the Company believes the ultimate liability with respect to these contingent obligations will not have, either individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Concentrations The components and products used in the factory-built housing operations are presently available from a variety of vendors, and the Company is not dependent upon any single supplier. Prices of certain materials, such as lumber, insulation, steel and drywall, can fluctuate significantly due to changes in demand and supply. Additionally, availability of certain materials, such as drywall and insulation, has sometimes been limited, resulting in higher prices and/or the need to find alternative suppliers. The Company generally has been able to pass higher material costs on to its customers in the form of surcharges and price increases. Sales from the Company's Canadian operations were approximately 6 % of consolidated sales for fiscal 2023 , and 7 % in fiscal 2022, 2021. The Company’s net assets in Canada totaled approximately $ 124.7 million and $ 107.5 million at April 1, 2023 and April 2, 2022, respectively. The Company has approximately 7,700 employees. The Company’s manufacturing facilities in Canada employ approximately 750 workers, and most of the workers belong to trade associations that operate under collective bargaining agreements. There are five collective bargaining agreements (one for each Canadian manufacturing facility) and each have separate expiration dates. The agreements are set to expire at various dates between November 2023 and December 2025.

B USINESS General Overview Skyline Champion Corporation, an Indiana corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries are referred to herein as ""Skyline Champion,"" ""us,"" ""we,"" ""our,"" the ""Company,"" and any other similar terms, unless otherwise indicated in this Annual Report. We are a leading producer of factory-built housing in North America with net sales for the year ended April 2, 2022 (“fiscal 2022”) of approximately $2.2 billion. We have more than 70 years of homebuilding experience, approximately 8,400 employees and 41 manufacturing facilities located in 19 states across the United States and three provinces in western Canada. We offer a leading portfolio of manufactured and modular homes, park model RVs, accessory dwelling units (“ADUs”) and modular buildings for the multi-family and hospitality sectors. Our facilities are strategically located to serve strong markets in the United States and western Canada. We operated 14 manufacturing facilities in the top ten states with the highest number of manufactured homes shipped in fiscal 2022, as well as 16 manufacturing facilities in the ten states with the greatest growth in the number of manufactured homes shipped in the last ten years. We believe that we maintained the following leading positions in the factory-built housing industry in the United States and western Canada (based on units) in calendar year 2021: We believe our market leading positions are driven by our comprehensive product offering, strong brand reputation, broad manufacturing footprint, and our complementary retail and logistics businesses. Our market share in the United States total housing market is approximately 2.6%. Our market share in the United States manufactured housing market segment has increased from approximately 8% in the beginning of fiscal 2011 to approximately 19% in fiscal 2022 based on total number of units produced. We design and build a range of manufactured and modular homes, park model RVs, ADUs, and commercial structures. We believe that the high quality and broad scope of our product and service offerings provide us a competitive advantage relative to other factory-built and certain site-built homes. With our award-winning product designs, we seek to meet the needs of our localized customers, while also providing them with an array of pre-designed options. Our leading brands are marketed and distributed through a network of independent and company-owned retailers, community operators, government agencies, and builder/developers. We build homes under some of the most well-known brand names in the factory-built housing industry including Skyline Homes, Champion Home Builders, Genesis Homes, Athens Park Models, Dutch Housing, Atlantic Homes, Excel Homes, Homes of Merit, New Era, Redman Homes, ScotBilt Homes, Shore Park, Silvercrest, and Titan Homes in the U.S., and Moduline and SRI Homes in western Canada. In addition to our core home building business, we provide construction services to install and set-up factory-built homes, we operate a factory-direct manufactured home retail business, Titan Factory Direct, with 18 sales centers spanning the southern United States, and we operate Star Fleet Trucking, which provides transportation services to the manufactured housing and other industries from several dispatch locations across the United States. 4 Our principal executive offices are located at 755 West Big Beaver Road, Suite 1000, Troy, Michigan 48084. Our website is located at www.skylinechampion.com. Our website and the information contained on our website is not incorporated by reference and is not a part of this Annual Report. We make available on our website, as soon as reasonably practicable, all of the reports required to be filed with the SEC. Our SEC filings are also available to the public on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov . Business Strategy We will continue to pursue opportunities to grow our revenue and earnings by constructing quality-built, sustainable, and innovatively designed homes and other modular structures in an environmentally friendly factory setting. In connection with executing this business strategy, we are focused on the following four initiatives: Increasing the Operating Capacity and Profitability of our Existing Facilities We are currently focused on a number of ongoing operational initiatives to further enhance our operating margins and increase production capacity including: Investing in our Customers’ Online Digital Experience The Company continues to invest in the design and testing of enhanced digital offerings. We are currently piloting an end-to-end platform where consumers can design, configure, and price their homes online, which we believe will ultimately drive revenue growth for Skyline Champion and our channel partners. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen tremendous online interest from consumers and believe use of a digital platform to customize and purchase homes will continue to grow. Implementing Production Automation and Enterprise-wide Digital Technology Continuing a Balanced Organic and Acquisition-Based Growth Strategy In June 2021, the Company acquired two idle facilities in Navasota, Texas in order to increase our production capabilities in the Texas market. The Company began production and completed the certification process at one of these facilities in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. On February 28, 2021, we acquired ScotBilt Homes, LLC and related companies from SHI Group Holdings, Inc. (collectively, “ScotBilt”). ScotBilt operated two manufacturing facilities in Georgia providing affordable housing throughout Alabama, Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas. The acquisition helped to balance our national distribution and complement our existing manufacturing footprint in the attractive mid-south region. The operations of ScotBilt are included in our financial results since the date of the acquisition. During fiscal 2022, we completed the successful cultural, processes, systems and internal controls integration of the acquired facilities into our operations. In January 2021, we closed on the purchase of two idled manufacturing facilities in North Carolina, one of the strongest growth states in the U.S. We anticipate beginning production at one of these facilities in late fiscal 2023. 5 We have demonstrated our ability to broaden our manufacturing and retail presence through the successful execution of a balanced organic growth and acquisition-based strategy. As demand for affordable housing grows and the raw material supply chain normalizes, we will continue to execute on this growth strategy. We believe our idle manufacturing plants provide us with the ability to grow with demand over the longer term. We also continue to explore opportunities to acquire value-enhancing retail locations, manufacturing facilities, and factory-built housing competitors to supplement our organic growth initiatives. We have a proven track-record of executing and integrating acquisitions. Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) We demonstrate our commitment to ESG through company-wide and plant-specific programs and through our everyday business practices when providing high-quality, yet affordable homes to U.S. and Canadian homebuyers. Manufactured and modular homes cost up to 50% less per square foot than conventional site-built homes, expanding the opportunity for individuals to own a home despite an ever-growing housing affordability gap. The Board of Directors has formal responsibility for the oversight and integration of all of the Company’s sustainability programs and policies, and the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, and Nominating and Governance Committee have lead responsibility for the Company’s strategy, policies and practices with respect to environmental sustainability, social and human capital matters, and governance, respectively. Our five ESG tenets include: (1) Environmental Focus, (2) Health & Safety, (3) Human Capital, (4) Community Outreach, and (5) Governance. Skyline Champion manages its operations to minimize resource consumption and environmental impacts. We continue to identify opportunities to reduce our environmental impact across our operations by reducing raw material waste, designing and constructing energy efficient homes, conserving our natural resources through recycling programs and reducing our carbon footprint by producing our homes in factories close to where our customers and employees live. Many of our U.S. manufacturing facilities are certified to produce Energy Star® energy efficient rated homes through a special EPA program for manufactured housing. Environmental sustainability is at the forefront of what we do every day. We construct manufactured homes in controlled environments. Our efficient construction process results in less energy usage and material waste compared to traditional site-built construction. In many of our plants, we have transitioned to LED lighting, and we recycle insulation material, lumber, metals, plastics, paper and many other products. In the course of executing our expansion plans, we have repurposed older buildings, both revitalizing the local community and preserving vacant land. This reduces the need for new building materials and extensive deployment of construction equipment, and thus reduces carbon emissions. On our journey, we have launched a program to participate in reforestation. With forestry products central to the construction of homes, we began participation in a program to plant one tree for every tree used in construction of our homes in fiscal 2022. Reforestation contributes to the environment by replenishing forests, reducing greenhouses gases (""GHG""), and protecting local watersheds. As a nationwide provider of affordable housing, we have a social responsibility to not only the buyers of our homes, our retail and community customers and our employees, but also to the communities in which they live and work. Many of our manufacturing facilities participate locally to support programs such as Habitat for Humanity and other local charities as well as work-study programs with local community colleges and high schools. Skyline Champion is committed to good corporate governance. We strive to maintain strong governance practices that protect and enhance accountability for the benefit of Skyline Champion, its shareholders, customers, employees and other business stakeholders. We regularly review and refine our governance practices and policies to align with evolving issues. Our internal risk management team oversees compliance with applicable laws and regulations and coordinates with subject matter experts throughout the business to identify, monitor and mitigate risk including information security risk management and cyber defense programs. Skyline Champion’s Corporate Governance Guidelines, the charters of committees of our Board and our Code of Conduct can be found in the Governance Documents section under the Governance tab on our website at www.skylinechampion.com . Additional information on our Corporate Governance policies can be found in our Proxy Statement filed with the SEC. 6 Human Capital and Diversity The Skyline Champion team manages the business in accordance with the Company’s Core Operating Principles: We appreciate each member of the Skyline Champion team and the unique skills and diversity of thought each provides to the overall success of the Company. We strive for an inclusive environment and reward individual contributions that foster innovative ideas for improving our products and workplace. We do not tolerate discrimination or harassment of any kind including but not limited discrimination or harassment to on the basis of gender identity, race, religion, age or disabilities. We are committed to the development of our employees. The Company follows standard onboarding and training protocols for our direct labor team members and also offers management and OSHA training for our supervisors. We are committed to improving employee engagement and reducing turnover through these onboarding, training and mentoring activities. Depending on availability, our plants participate in local outreach programs and hire disadvantaged members of the local community. We have built a diverse team with a wide range of experiences. At April 2, 2022, we employed approximately 8,400 full and part time employees. Our human capital resource objectives include identifying, recruiting, training, retaining and incentivizing our employees. We offer our employees a competitive compensation package, including an array of benefits, and we deem our relationship with our employees to be generally good. At April 2, 2022, our manufacturing facilities in Canada employed approximately 950 workers of which the majority belong to trade associations that operate under collective bargaining agreements. There are five collective bargaining agreements (one for each Canadian manufacturing facility) and each has separate expiration dates. The agreements are set to expire at various dates between June 2022 and June 2024. We are committed to conducting our business with integrity and in compliance with all applicable laws of the cities, states and countries in which we operate. We have adopted a written Code of Conduct and Ethics and in fiscal 2022 implemented a new company wide training program to assist employees in this regard. We encourage employees to report concerns through a variety of channels, including a compliance and ethics line which allows for anonymous reporting. All reports are investigated and resolved. We also maintain an anti-retaliation policy such that any employee who reports a concern in good faith is protected from harassment, retaliation or adverse employment consequences. We take the health and safety of our employees seriously. We provide a variety of Company sponsored healthcare programs, including health, dental, and vision, that allow employees to manage their and their family's health and wellbeing. We expect each employee to follow our safety standards and protocols. Our corporate Environmental Health and Safety (“EHS”) team works to benchmark and implement EHS best practices at our plants. Each of our locations performs regular safety audits to ensure that proper safety policies are in place and appropriate safety training is provided. In addition to training and development, we measure and report out on monthly safety metrics and regularly review our safety performance with our Board of Directors. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented standards to operate in accordance with social-distancing protocols and public health authority guidelines. In fiscal 2021 in response to the pandemic, the Company offered extended benefits to employees, including increased sick pay and waived premium payments on healthcare benefits for furloughed employees. Factory-Built Housing A majority of our manufactured products are constructed in accordance with the regulations and rules of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) and the National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974, as amended (""HUD code""). We produce a broad range of manufactured and modular homes under a variety of brand names and in a variety of floor plans and price ranges. While most of the homes we build are single-family, multi-section, ranch-style homes, we also build two-story and single-section homes, as well as multi-family units such as town homes, apartments, duplexes, and triplexes. The single-family homes that we manufacture generally range in size from 400 to 4,000 square feet and typically include two to four bedrooms, a living room or family room, a dining room, a kitchen and typically two full bathrooms. We also build park model RVs for resorts and campgrounds, ADUs for backyard or recreational living, and commercial modular structures. We regularly introduce homes with new floor plans, exterior designs and elevations, decors and features. Our corporate marketing and engineering departments work with our manufacturing facilities to design homes that appeal to consumers’ changing 7 tastes at appropriate price points for their respective markets. We design and build homes with a traditional residential or site-built appearance through the use of, among other features, dormers and higher pitched roofs. We offer our Genesis brand of homes which have features similar to site-built home amenities such as porches and garages. These homes are designed to be eligible for financing programs with terms similar to traditional mortgages. We are also very active in the design and construction of energy-efficient homes. The components and products used in factory-built housing are generally of the same quality as those used by other home builders, including conventional site-builders. The primary components include lumber, plywood, OSB, drywall, steel, floor coverings, insulation, exterior siding (vinyl, composites, wood and metal), doors, windows, shingles, kitchen appliances, furnaces, plumbing and electrical fixtures and hardware. These components are presently available from a variety of sources and we are not dependent upon any single supplier. Prices of certain materials such as lumber, insulation, steel, and drywall can fluctuate significantly due to changes in demand and supply. Lumber and related products experienced significant cost increases in fiscal 2022, primarily as a result of supply chain disruptions. Those disruptions have also impacted the availability of certain raw materials and components. We endeavor to mitigate the impact of supply chain challenges through sourcing alternative materials, where appropriate, and exploring alternative supply options. We generally have been able to pass higher material costs on to customers in the form of surcharges and price increases. Typically, a one to three-week supply of raw materials is maintained, but continued supply chain volatility has caused our manufacturing operations to increase the amount of frequently used raw materials on hand versus what is typically carried. Most completed factory-built homes have components consistent with conventional site-builders, such as cabinets, wall and floor coverings, appliances, and electrical, heating and plumbing systems. Optional factory installed features include fireplaces, dormers, entertainment centers and skylights. Upon completion of the home at the factory, homes sold to retailers are transported to a retail sales center or directly to the home site. Homes sold to builders and developers are generally transported directly to the home site. At the home site, the home is placed on a foundation or otherwise affixed to the property and readied for occupancy, either by our employee set crews or third party contractors. The sections (also referred to as floors) of a multi-section home are joined and the interior and exterior seams are finished at the home site. The consumer purchase of the home may also include retailer or contractor supplied items such as additional appliances, air conditioning, furniture, porches, decks, and garages. We construct homes in indoor facilities using an assembly-line process employing approximately 100 to 200 production employees at each facility. Factory-built HUD code homes are constructed in one or more sections affixed to a steel support frame that allows the sections to be moved through the assembly line and transported upon sale. The sections of many of the modular homes we produce are built on wooden floor systems and transported on carriers that are removed upon placement of the home at the home site. Each section or floor is assembled in stages, beginning with the construction of the frame and the floor, then adding the walls, ceiling and roof assembly, and other constructed and purchased components, and ending with a final quality control inspection. The efficiency of the assembly-line process, protection from the weather, and favorable pricing of materials resulting from our substantial purchasing power enables us to produce homes more quickly and often at a lower cost than a conventional site-built home of similar quality. The production schedules of our homebuilding facilities are based upon customer orders. Orders are generally subject to cancellation at any time up to the commencement of production without penalty and are not necessarily an indication of future business. Retailers place orders for retail stocking (inventory) purposes and for homebuyer orders. Before scheduling homes for production, orders and availability of financing are confirmed with our customer and, where applicable, their customer's lender. Because we produce homes to fulfill wholesale orders, our factories generally do not carry finished goods inventories, except for homes awaiting delivery. We manage our production levels, capacity and workforce size based upon current market demands. Historically, orders were generally filled within 90 days of receipt; however, delivery times have been extended over the past two years due to the increase in our sales backlog caused by strong demand for affordable housing. At April 2, 2022, we had a backlog of home orders with wholesale sales value of approximately $1.6 billion. After production of a particular home has commenced, the order becomes noncancelable and the customer is obligated to take delivery of the home. Although factory-built homes can be produced throughout the year in indoor facilities, demand for homes is usually affected by inclement weather and by the cold winter months in northern areas of the U.S. and in Canada. Charges to transport homes increase with the distance from the factory to the retailer or home site. As a result, most of the retailers and builders/developers we sell to are located within a 500-mile radius of our manufacturing plants. In addition to our traditional channels of distribution, we are one of a limited number of manufactured homebuilders that have been approved for contracts with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (“FEMA”) and have historically provided housing assistance requirements following natural disasters and other housing emergencies. On February 7, 2022, we received a Delivery Disaster Relief Order from FEMA for approximately $200 million in revenue to be completed by September 2022. We offer a wide selection of manufactured and modular homes as well as park model RVs at company-owned retail locations marketed under the Titan Factory Direct brand. We maintain our company-owned retail presence through 18 retail sales centers in Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, North Carolina, Oklahoma, and Texas. Our captive retail distribution enhances the reach of our factory-built housing products directly to the homebuyer. 8 Each of our full-service retail sales centers has a sales office and a variety of model homes of various sizes, floor plans, features, and prices that are displayed in a residential setting with sidewalks and landscaping. Customers may purchase a home from an inventory of homes maintained at the location, including a model home, or may order a home that will be built at a manufacturing facility. Our retail organization provides industry leadership with the expertise to be responsive to local economic conditions and ultimately provide affordable homes to value-conscious homebuyers. During fiscal 2022, the average selling price was $80,656 for our U.S. factory-built homes and $107,589 for homes sold through our Canadian housing segment. Manufactured home sales prices ranged from $20,000 to over $350,000. Retail sales prices of the homes, without land, generally ranged from $35,000 to over $300,000, depending upon size, floor plan, features, and options. Logistics We operate a logistics business, Star Fleet Trucking, specializing in the transportation of manufactured homes and recreational vehicles from manufacturing facilities to retailers. Star Fleet’s delivery logistics are coordinated through dispatch terminals located throughout the U.S. Star Fleet has strong relationships with its customer base, which includes some of the largest manufactured housing companies (including our own factory-built housing operations), and recreational vehicle manufacturers in the U.S. Market Overview General. Since July 2020, U.S. and Canadian housing demand has been robust. The limited availability of existing homes for sale and the broader need for newly built affordable, single-family housing has continued to drive demand for new homes in these markets. Factory-built housing provides an affordable alternative to other types of housing such as site-built housing and condominiums, and to existing housing such as pre-owned homes and apartments. According to statistics published by the Institute for Building Technology and Safety (""IBTS"") and the United States Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, for the 2021 calendar year, manufactured housing wholesale shipments of homes constructed in accordance with the HUD code accounted for an estimated 10% of all new single-family homes starts. According to data reported by the Manufactured Housing Institute (“MHI”), industry manufactured home shipments were 108,964, 95,588, and 97,553 units during fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Annual shipments have generally increased each year since calendar year 2009 when only 50,000 HUD-coded manufactured homes were shipped, the lowest level since the industry began recording statistics in 1959. While shipments of HUD-coded manufactured homes have improved modestly in recent years, manufactured housing’s most recent annual shipment levels still operate at lower levels than the long-term historical average of over 200,000 units annually. The market for factory-built housing is affected by a number of factors, including the availability, cost and credit underwriting standards of consumer financing, consumer confidence, employment levels, general housing market, interest rates and other economic conditions and the overall affordability of factory-built housing versus other forms of housing. In the past, a number of factors have restricted demand for factory-built housing, including, in some cases, less-favorable financing terms compared to site-built housing, the effects of restrictive zoning on the availability of certain locations for home placement and, in some cases, an unfavorable public image. Certain of these adverse factors have lessened considerably in recent years with the improved quality and appearance of factory-built housing. Home Buyer Demographics. We believe the segment of the housing market in which manufactured housing is most competitive includes consumers with household incomes under $60,000. This segment has a high representation of young single persons and married couples, first time home buyers, and homebuyers age 55 and older. The comparatively low cost of manufactured homes is attractive to these consumers. People in rural areas, where fewer housing alternatives exist, and those who presently live in factory-built homes, also make up a significant portion of the demand for new factory-built housing. We believe higher-priced, multi-section manufactured and modular homes are attractive to households with higher incomes as an alternative to rental housing and condominiums and are well suited to meet the needs of the retiree buyer in many markets. The two largest manufactured housing consumer demographics are Millennials (generally defined as those born between 1981 – 1996) and Baby Boomers (generally defined as those born between 1946 – 1964). Millennials are generally first-time home buyers who may be attracted by the affordability and diversity of style choices of factory-built homes. Baby Boomers are similarly interested in the value proposition; however, they are also motivated by the energy efficiency and low maintenance requirements of factory-built homes, and by the lifestyle offered by planned communities that are specifically designed for homeowners that fall into this age group. More recently, we have seen a number of market trends pointing to increased sales of ADUs and urban-to-rural migration as customers accommodate working from home patterns as well as people seeking rent-to-own single-family options. Financing Commercial Financing. Independent retailers of factory-built homes generally finance their inventory purchases from manufacturers with floor plan financing provided by third-party lending institutions and secured by a lien on the homes. The availability and cost of floor plan financing can affect the amount of retailer new home inventory, the number of retail sales centers and related wholesale demand. Under a typical floor plan financing arrangement, an independent financial institution specializing in 9 this line of business provides the retailer with a loan for the purchase price of the home and maintains a security interest in the home as collateral. The financial institution customarily requires us, as the manufacturer of the home, to enter into a separate repurchase agreement with the financial institution that, upon default by the retailer and under certain other circumstances, obligates us to repurchase the financed home at declining prices over the term of the repurchase agreement (which, in most cases, is 18 to 36 months). The price at which we may be obligated to repurchase a home under these agreements is based upon the amount financed, plus certain administrative and shipping expenses. Our obligation under these repurchase agreements ceases upon the purchase of the home by the retail customer. The maximum amount of our contingent obligations under such repurchase agreements was approximately $339.5 million a s of April 2, 2022. The risk of loss under these agreements is spread over many retailers and is further reduced by the resale value of the homes. During fiscal 2022, approximately 39% of our sales to independent retailers were financed under floor plan agreements with national lenders, while the remaining 61% were financed under various arrangements with local or regional banks or paid in cash. We generally receive payment from the lending institution 5 to 10 days after a home is sold and invoiced. Consumer Financing. Sales of factory-built homes are significantly affected by the availability, credit underwriting standards, and cost of consumer financing. There are three basic types of consumer financing in the factory-built housing industry: 1) conforming mortgage loans which comply with the requirements of the Federal Housing Administration (“FHA”), Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Agriculture or Government-Sponsored Enterprise (“GSE”) loans which include Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loans; 2) non-conforming mortgage loans for purchasers of the home and the land on which the home is placed; and 3) personal property loans (often referred to as home-only or chattel loans) for consumers where the home is the sole collateral for the loan (generally HUD-coded homes). Industry trade associations are working towards favorable legislative and GSE action to address the mortgage financing needs of potential buyers of affordable homes, and some progress has been achieved. Many moderate-income families cannot afford to buy a home due to the increasing costs of newly constructed homes, rising interest rates, and decreasing supply of existing, affordable homes. Federal law required the GSEs to issue a regulation to implement the Duty to Serve (“DTS”) requirements specified in the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992, as amended by the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac released their final Underserved Markets Plan for 2022 – 2024 that describes, with specificity, the actions they will take over that three-year period to fulfill the DTS obligation. These plans became effective on January 1, 2022. The GSEs' Underserved Markets Plan's current areas of focus are as follows: 1) purchase more loans used to finance manufactured homes titled as real property; 2) enhance current products and create new offerings; and 3) enhance tenant protections in manufactured housing communities. In 2020, the GSEs rolled out financing programs specifically for homes built to the HUD code, which include CHOICEHome® from Freddie Mac and MH Advantage® from Fannie Mae. HUD-coded homes manufactured for these programs have features comparable to site-built homes, including, drywall throughout, higher-pitch roof line, energy-efficient features, lower profile foundation, plus additional options such as a garage or carport. These products aim to promote quality manufactured homes as an acceptable alternative to site-built homes and will allow moderate-income families to purchase a manufactured home with lending terms similar to those for site-built homes. Our Genesis brand of homes is built to these specifications. We continue to work with builder/developers to cultivate strategies to bring these products to the marketplace. The DTS plans also explored the potential for the GSEs to provide liquidity to the chattel lending market. The GSEs could potentially serve as additional sources of funding as there is unmet demand in the chattel loan industry, and GSE involvement could increase volume substantially. Freddie Mac has indicated that it plans to develop requirements and a process to support loan purchases of manufactured homes titled as real property. The Fannie Mae DTS plan includes a provision indicating that it is exploring a pilot to establish a secondary market for chattel or home-only loans and an objective to explore ways to manage risks in the market. The Fannie Mae DTS plan also includes an objective to explore opportunities to facilitate financing of loans secured by manufactured homes tiled as real property in certain manufactured housing communities. Expansion of the secondary market for home-only lending through the GSEs could provide further demand for housing, as lending options would likely become more available to homebuyers. Separate from the GSE involvement in chattel markets, there have been several secondary market chattel private placement offerings over the last three years. Although some limited progress has been made in this area, a meaningful positive impact in the form of increased home orders has yet to be realized. Competition The housing industry is highly competitive based upon several factors, including price, product features, reputation for service and quality, depth of distribution or location, and financing. Capital requirements for entry into the industry are relatively low. Factory-built housing is also very competitive. According to MHI, in March 2022, there were 33 producers of manufactured homes in the U.S. operating an estimated 141 production facilities. For calendar 2021, the top three companies had a combined market share for HUD code homes of approximately 75%. We estimate that there were approximately 3,200 industry retail locations throughout the U.S. during calendar 2021. 10 Based on industry data reported by IBTS, in fiscal 2022 our U.S. wholesale market share of HUD code homes sold was 19.3%, compared to 16.9% in fiscal 2021. We compete with the other producers of manufactured homes, as well as companies selling homes repossessed from wholesalers or consumers. In addition, manufactured homes compete with new and existing site-built homes, as well as apartments, townhouses, and condominiums. Collectively, manufactured housing represents approximately only nine percent of annual U.S. single family home starts. There are a number of other national manufacturers competing for a significant share of the manufactured housing market in the U.S., including Clayton Homes and Cavco Industries. Certain of these competitors may possess greater financial, manufacturing, distribution, and marketing resources. Government Regulation Our manufactured homes are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws, codes and regulations. The majority of our homes are built to comply with the HUD code which includes regulations that cover all aspects of manufactured home construction and installation, including structural integrity, fire safety, wind loads, thermal protection and ventilation. To the extent state and local regulations conflict with the HUD code, they are pre-empted. Our modular homes and commercial structures are built to comply with applicable state and local building codes. Our park model RVs are built in conformity with the applicable standards approved by the American National Standards Institute, a private, non-profit organization that administers and coordinates voluntary standards and conformity programs. A variety of laws affect the financing of the homes we manufacture. The Federal Consumer Credit Protection Act and Regulation Z promulgated thereunder require written disclosure of information relating to such financing, including the amount of the annual percentage interest rate and the finance charge. A variety of state laws also regulate the form of financing documents and the allowable deposits, finance charge and fees charged. Federal laws permit manufactured housing retailers to assist home buyers with securing financing for the purchase of homes; however, they are prohibited from negotiating the financing terms. Governmental authorities enforcing these numerous laws and regulations can impose fines and/or seek injunctive relief for violations. We believe that our operations are in compliance with the requirements of the applicable laws and regulations. Seasonality The housing industry is subject to seasonal fluctuations based on home buyer purchasing patterns. We typically experience decreased home buyer traffic during holidays and popular vacation periods. Demand for our core single-family new home products typically peaks each spring and summer before declining in the winter, consistent with the overall housing industry. Typical seasonal patterns were not as prevalent in fiscal 2022 and 2021 as demand for affordable housing has increased significantly. We expect seasonal patterns to return once demand returns to more typical levels. Available Information Our website address is www.skylinechampion.com and we make available, free of charge, on or through our website all of our periodic reports, including our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K, as soon as reasonably practicable after we file such reports with the SEC. 11 ITEM 1A. RI SK FACTORS Our business involves a number of risks and uncertainties. You should carefully consider the following risks, together with the information provided elsewhere in this Annual Report. The items described below are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks that are currently unknown to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial may also impair our business or adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Market, Industry and Supply Chain Risks Raw material shortages and price increases could delay or increase the cost of construction of our products which could materially and adversely impact our results of operations and our cash flows. Certain materials used in the construction of homes such as lumber, insulation, steel, drywall, oil-based products and fuel, among others, can become scarce during periods of high demand for new home construction as well as renovation and remodeling of existing homes. We depend on timely and sufficient delivery of raw materials from our suppliers. In addition, a few key components of our products are produced by a small group of quality suppliers that have the capacity to supply large quantities. Disruption to the supply chain of these key components could have an adverse impact on our production output. Raw material shortages from these and other suppliers can be more severe during periods following natural disasters or broader economic disruptions such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Pricing for raw materials can also be affected by the factors mentioned above as well as national, regional, local, economic and political factors, including tariffs. As a result, we may continue to see raw material cost pressures in future periods as strong housing demand continues. We may attempt to pass the higher material costs on to customers, but it is not certain that we will be able to achieve this without adversely affecting demand. Raw material shortages and price increases could cause delays in and increases to our costs of construction which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The factory-built housing industry is cyclical, is affected by seasonality and is sensitive to changes in general economic or other business conditions. The factory-built housing industry is affected by seasonality. Sales during the period from March to November are typically higher than in other months. As a result, our sales and operating results sometimes fluctuate and may continue to fluctuate in the future. The factory-built housing industry is also sensitive to changes in economic conditions and other factors, such as pandemics, employment rates, job growth, population growth, consumer confidence, consumer income, availability of financing, interest rate levels, and an oversupply of homes for sale. Changes in any of these conditions generally, or in the markets where we operate, could reduce demand and constrain pricing for new factory-built homes in these areas or result in customer cancellations of pending shipments. Reductions in the number of homes shipped by us, or constraints on the prices we can charge, could result in a decrease in our net sales and earnings, which could adversely affect our financial condition. We are subject to demand fluctuations in the housing industry. Changes in demand could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Demand for our homes is subject to fluctuations in the housing market generally. In a housing market downturn, our sales and results of operations could be adversely affected; there might be significant inventory impairments and other write-offs; our gross margins could decline significantly from historical levels; and we might incur losses from operations. We cannot predict the future demand for housing. If it were to decline significantly, our financial condition could be adversely affected. Rapid or significantly increasing demand can also adversely affect our business. Longer periods of time between order acceptance and production introduce a risk that we may not be able to construct homes profitably if material and labor costs increase. Although we have generally been able to pass along price increases to our customers in periods of rising costs, we may not be able to in the future, or the price increases may cause consumers to explore other housing alternatives and/or exit the home buying process, negatively impacting demand for our homes. Factory-built housing operates in the highly competitive housing industry, and, if other home builders are more successful or offer better value to our customers, then our business could decline. We operate in a very competitive environment and face competition from a number of other home builders in each market in which we operate. We compete with large national and regional home building companies and with smaller local home builders for financing, raw materials, and skilled management and labor resources. Some of our manufacturing competitors have captive retail distribution systems and consumer finance and insurance operations. In addition, there are independent factory-built housing retail locations that sell competitors’ products in most areas where our homes are sold and in most areas where we have Company-owned 12 retail operations. Because barriers to entry to the industry at both the manufacturing and retail levels are low, we believe that it is relatively easy for new competitors to enter our markets. In addition, our products compete within the housing industry more broadly with other forms of low to moderate-cost housing, including site-built homes, panelized homes, apartments, townhouses, condominiums, and repossessed homes. We also compete with resale homes, also referred to as “previously owned” or “existing” homes, as well as rental housing. An oversupply of homes available for sale or the heavy discounting of home prices by our competitors could adversely affect demand for our homes and the results of our operations. An increase in competitive conditions could have any of the following impacts on us: sale of fewer homes or higher cancellations by our home buyers; an increase in selling incentives or reduction of prices; and realization of lower gross margins due to lower selling prices or an inability to increase selling prices to offset increased costs of the homes delivered. If we are unable to compete effectively in our markets, then our business could decline disproportionately to that of our competitors. As a result, our sales could decline and our results of operations and cash flows could suffer. Changes in consumer preferences for our products or our failure to gauge those preferences could lead to reduced sales. We cannot be certain that historical consumer preferences for factory-built homes in general, and for our products in particular, will remain unchanged. Our ability to remain competitive depends heavily on our ability to provide a continuing and timely introduction of innovative product offerings. We believe that the introduction of new features, designs, and models will be critical to the future success of our operations. Managing frequent product introductions poses inherent risks. Delays in the introduction or market acceptance of new models, designs, or product features could have a material adverse effect on our business. Products may not be accepted for a number of reasons, including changes in consumer preferences or our failure to properly gauge consumer preferences. Further, we cannot be certain that new product introductions will not reduce net sales from existing models and adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, our net sales may be adversely affected if our new models and products are not introduced to the market on time or are not successful when introduced. Finally, our competitors’ products may obtain better market acceptance despite our efforts to lead the market. Increases in tax rates or fees on developers by local government authorities could deter potential customers from buying our products and adversely affect our business or results of operations. Increases in property tax rates or fees on developers by local governmental authorities, as experienced in response to reduced federal and state funding or to fund local initiatives, such as funding schools or road improvements, or increases in home insurance premiums, can adversely affect the ability of potential customers to obtain financing or their desire to purchase new homes, and in turn can have adverse impacts on our business and results of operations. Any changes to individual tax rules concerning the deductibility of mortgage interest expenses and real estate taxes could deter customers from home ownership. Natural disasters and severe weather conditions could delay deliveries, increase costs, and decrease demand for new factory-built homes in affected areas. Our operations are located in many areas that are subject to natural disasters and severe weather. The occurrence of natural disasters or severe weather conditions can delay factory-built home deliveries, increase costs by damaging inventories, reduce the availability of materials, and negatively impact the demand for new factory-built homes in affected areas. Furthermore, if our insurance does not fully cover business interruptions or losses resulting from these events, then our earnings, liquidity, or capital resources could be adversely affected. Increased attention to environmental, social and governance matters may impact our business, financial results or stock price. Increased attention continues to be directed to publicly traded companies and their activities related to environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) matters, including new proposed rules by the SEC regarding climate-related disclosures. Advocacy groups have campaigned for action to promote change at public companies related to ESG matters. These activities include increasing action related to climate change and the use of energy efficient building products. A failure, or perceived failure, to respond to investor or customer expectations related to ESG concerns could cause harm to our business and reputation. In addition, organizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and other matters have developed ratings systems for evaluating companies on their approach to ESG. Unfavorable ESG ratings may lead to negative investor sentiment which could have a negative impact on our stock price. 13 Regulatory Risks Environmental laws and regulations relating to climate change and energy can have an adverse impact on our business, our results of operations and on the availability and price of certain raw materials. Government regulations proposed or enacted in response to climate change could result in increased costs of raw materials and other manufacturing production costs of our homes. We believe that a variety of new legislation may be considered at the federal, state and local levels relating to climate change and energy efficiency. This legislation could result in changes to the HUD-code and other building standards requiring more robust energy efficiency standards or require the use of energy-saving construction material in our products. New building code requirements that impose stricter energy efficiency standards could significantly increase our costs. Compliance with these new standards may also cause an increase in our costs and use of human capital resources. As climate change and energy efficiency remains a global focus, energy-related initiatives will impact many companies including our suppliers of many of our raw materials such as lumber and steel. The initiatives undertaken by our suppliers could adversely impact our results of operations to the extent our suppliers raise their prices to cover energy and climate related initiatives. New environmental laws and regulations could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations. If the factory-built housing industry is not able to secure favorable local zoning ordinances, our sales could decline and our results of operations and cash flows could suffer. Limitations on the number of sites available for placement of factory-built homes or on the operation of factory-built housing communities could reduce the demand for factory-built homes and, as a result, our sales. Factory-built housing communities and individual home placements are subject to local zoning ordinances and other local regulations relating to utility service and construction of roadways. In the past, some property owners have resisted the adoption of zoning ordinances permitting the use of factory-built homes in residential areas, which we believe has restricted the growth of the industry. Factory-built homes may not receive widespread acceptance and localities may not adopt zoning ordinances permitting the development of factory-built home communities. If the factory-built housing industry is unable to secure favorable local zoning ordinances, then our sales could decline and our results of operations and cash flows could suffer. We are subject to extensive regulation affecting the production and sale of factory-built housing, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We are subject to a variety of federal, state, and local laws and regulations affecting the production and sale of factory-built housing. Our failure to comply with such laws and regulations could expose us to a wide variety of sanctions, including closing one or more manufacturing facilities. Regulatory matters affecting our operations are under regular review by governmental bodies and we cannot predict what effect, if any, new laws and regulations would have on us or on the factory-built housing industry. Failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or the passage in the future of new and more stringent laws, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The transportation industry is subject to government regulation, and regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Our Star Fleet Trucking subsidiary provides transportation services. The transportation industry is subject to legislative or regulatory changes, including potential limits on carbon emissions under climate change legislation and Department of Transportation regulations regarding, among other things, driver breaks, classification of independent drivers, “restart” rules, and the use of electronic logging devices that can affect the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or influencing the demand for, and cost of providing, transportation services. We may become subject to new or more restrictive regulations relating to fuel emissions or limits on vehicle weight and size. Future laws and regulations may be more stringent and require changes in operating practices, influence the demand for transportation services or increase the cost of providing transportation services, any of which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Operational Risks Our results of operations can be adversely affected by labor shortages, turnover and labor cost inflation. The homebuilding industry has from time-to-time experienced labor shortages and other labor-related issues. These labor shortages can be more severe during periods of strong demand for housing, during periods following natural disasters or as a result of broader economic disruptions such as the COVID-19 pandemic. A number of factors may adversely affect the labor force available to us and our subcontractors in one or more of our markets, including high employment levels, federal unemployment subsidies, changing work preferences of the labor force, and other government regulations, which include laws and regulations related to workers’ health and safety, wage and hour practices and immigration. These factors can also increase the cost of labor. We have historically experienced high turnover rates among our direct labor employees, which can lead to increased spending on training and 14 retention and, as a result, increased costs of production. An overall labor shortage or lack of skilled labor, increased turnover or labor inflation could cause significant increases in costs or delays in construction and delivery of homes, which could have a material adverse effect on our net sales and results of operations. Increased costs of transportation may adversely affect our operating results and cash flows. We rely on qualified truck drivers to deliver homes from our manufacturing facilities to retail centers and customer home sites. A lack of qualified drivers to deliver manufactured homes could result in an increase in our cost of goods sold and operating expenses. Additionally, delays in the shipment of completed homes due to lack of qualified drivers could impact our ability to meet customer demand on a timely basis. Customer cancellations could have a negative impact on our revenue and margins. Our backlog represents home orders from customers that will be produced in future periods. Orders in the backlog may be cancelled by customers at any time without penalty. Our backlog has increased significantly in fiscal 2022 driven by higher demand for single-family housing, which has resulted in order levels that have outpaced production. While cancellations have historically been low, longer lead times caused by the higher backlog could result in an increase in customer cancellations which could have an adverse impact on future financial performance. Orders in backlog may also be impacted by inflation. Customers obtain financing approval prior to ordering a home. Significant increases in prices may prevent customers from being able to qualify for financing at the time the home is ready to be produced causing the customer to cancel their order in our backlog. Complications with the implementation of our new enterprise-wide system could adversely impact our business and operations. We rely on information systems and technology to manage our business and summarize and report our operating results. In fiscal 2022, we began a multi-year replacement of our current information systems with a suite of cloud-based functionality. With the new system, we expect to improve decision-making capabilities through real-time data and analytics, simplify and standardize business processes, reduce manual effort, improve value-added activities, and improve transparency and accountability all while enhancing the customer experience making our company easier to do business with. The system selection and implementation process has required, and will continue to require, a significant investment of personnel and financial resources. We may not be able to successfully implement the new system without experiencing delays, increased costs and other difficulties. If we are unable to successfully implement the system as planned, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted. We have capitalized significant costs related to the development of the new system. A write-off of all or part of our capitalized costs could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, if we do not effectively implement the system as planned or it does not operate as intended, the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting could be adversely affected or our ability to assess those controls adequately could be delayed. If we are unable to establish or maintain relationships with independent distributors that sell our homes, our sales could decline and our results of operations and cash flows could suffer. Although we maintain our own factory direct retail business in select markets, we conduct a majority of our business through independent distributors. Over 90% of our shipments of homes in fiscal 2022 were made to independent distributors throughout the U.S. and western Canada. We may not be able to establish relationships with new independent distributors or maintain good relationships with independent distributors that sell our homes. Even if we establish and maintain relationships with independent distributors, these customers are not obligated to sell our homes exclusively and may choose to sell competitors’ homes instead. The independent distributors with whom we have relationships can cancel these relationships on short notice. In addition, these customers may not remain financially solvent, as they are subject to industry, economic, demographic, and seasonal trends similar to those faced by us. If we do not establish and maintain relationships with solvent independent distributors in the markets we serve, sales in those markets, if we cannot offset by sales through an expanded factory-direct retail business, could decline and our results of operations and cash flows could suffer. When we introduce new products into the marketplace, we may incur expenses that we did not anticipate, which, in turn, can result in reduced earnings. The introduction of new models, floor plans, and features are critical to our future success, but we may incur unexpected expenses when we make such introductions. For example, we may experience unexpected engineering or design flaws that may cause increased warranty costs. The costs resulting from these types of problems could be substantial and could have a significant adverse effect on our earnings. Estimated warranty costs are accrued at the time of product sale to reflect our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle existing and future claims on products. An increase in actual warranty claims costs as compared to our estimates could result in increased warranty reserves and expense, which could have adverse impacts on our earnings. 15 Our products and services may experience quality problems from time to time that can result in decreased sales and gross margin and can harm our reputation. Our products contain thousands of parts, many of which are supplied by a network of approved vendors. Product defects may occur, including components purchased from material vendors. There is no assurance that all such defects will be detected prior to the distribution of our products. In addition, although we endeavor to compel suppliers to maintain appropriate levels of insurance coverage, there is no assurance that if a defect in a vendor-supplied part were to occur that the vendor would have the financial ability to rectify the defect. Failure to detect defects in our products, including vendor-supplied parts, could result in lost revenue, increased warranty and related costs, and could harm our reputation. We may not be able to manage our business effectively if we cannot retain current management team members or if we are unable to attract and motivate key personnel. Our success depends upon the skills, experience, and active participation of our senior management and key employees, many of whom have been with us for a significant number of years. Changes in our senior management team or other key employees may result in operational disruptions and changes to the strategy of our business, and our business might be harmed as a result. Our business could be further disrupted and harmed if we were unable to find appropriate replacements on a timely basis following future departures. We may not be able to attract or motivate qualified management and operations personnel in the future. Inability to do so would result in constraints that would significantly impede the achievement of our objectives. We may also have difficulty attracting experienced personnel and may be required to expend significant financial resources in our employee recruitment efforts. Product liability claims and litigation and warranty claims that arise in the ordinary course of business may be costly, which could adversely affect our results of operations. As a home builder, we are subject to construction defect and home warranty claims arising in the ordinary course of business. These claims are common in the home building industry and can be costly. In addition, the costs of insuring against construction defect and product liability claims are high. There can be no assurance that this coverage will not be restricted and become more costly. If the limits or coverages of our current and former insurance programs prove inadequate, or we are unable to obtain adequate or reasonably-priced insurance against these types of claims in the future, or the amounts currently provided for future warranty or insurance claims are inadequate, then we may experience losses that could negatively impact our results of operations. We record expenses and liabilities based on the estimated costs required to cover our self-insured liability under our insurance policies, and estimated costs of potential claims and claim adjustment expenses that are above our coverage limits or that are not covered by our insurance policies. These estimated costs are based on an analysis of our historical claims and industry data, and include an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. Due to the degree of judgment required and the potential for variability in the underlying assumptions when deriving estimated liabilities, our actual future costs could differ from those estimated, and the difference could be material to our results of operations. Data security breaches, cybersecurity attacks, and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer. In the ordinary course of our business, we collect, use, and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our suppliers and business partners, as well as personally identifiable information of our customers and employees. We also have outsourced elements of our information technology structure and, as a result, we are managing independent vendor relationships with third parties who may or could have access to our confidential information. Similarly, our business partners and other third-party providers possess certain of our sensitive data. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Our ability to conduct our business may be negatively impacted if our or our service providers’ computer resources or connectivity are compromised, degraded, damaged, or if they fail. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance, or other disruptions, particularly with employees and others on data networks working increasingly from home because of the COVID-19 pandemic and other such factors. We, our partners, vendors, and other third-party providers could be susceptible to third-party attacks on our and their information security systems, which attacks are of ever-increasing levels of sophistication and are made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise, including criminal groups. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost, or stolen. Any such access, disclosure, or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, disrupt our operations, and damage our reputation, any of which could adversely affect our business. 16 Engaging in mergers, acquisitions, and start-up operations involves risks that could adversely affect our business. As part of our growth strategy, we may choose to engage in discussions and negotiations regarding mergers, acquisitions, start-ups, and other business combinations. The purchase price for possible acquisitions of businesses and assets might be paid from cash, borrowings, or through the issuance of common stock or other securities, or a combination of these methods. Business combinations and start-up operations entail numerous risks, including: We cannot be certain that we will be able to identify, consummate and successfully integrate business combinations, and no assurance can be given with respect to the timing, likelihood or business effect of any possible transaction. For example, we could begin negotiations that we subsequently decide to suspend or terminate for a variety of reasons. Also, business combinations are typically subject to closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and the absence of a material adverse change. Therefore, if and when we enter into a business combination agreement, there can be no guarantee that the transaction will close when expected, or at all. If a material transaction does not close, then our stock price could decline. Nevertheless, opportunities arise from time to time that we choose to evaluate. Any transactions that we pursue and consummate would involve these risks and uncertainties, as well as others. The risks of a business combination or startup of a greenfield or idled facility could result in the failure of the anticipated benefits of that particular combination to be realized, which in turn could have adverse effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Our risk management practices may leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risk. Our management team is responsible for managing risk, subject to oversight by our board of directors. Our risk management methods may not identify all future risk exposures and may not be completely effective in mitigating all key risks. Furthermore, our risk management methods may not properly identify and mitigate the aggregation of risks across the Company or the interdependency of our risk mitigation efforts. In addition, some of our risk management methods may be based on assumptions that will prove to be inaccurate. Failure to manage risk effectively could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Financial Risks Future increases in interest rates, more stringent credit standards, tightening of financing terms, or other increases in the effective costs of owning a factory-built home (including those related to regulation or other government actions) could limit the purchasing power of our potential customers and could adversely affect our business and financial results. A large portion of the people who buy our homes finance their home purchases through third-party lenders. Increases in interest rates or decreases in the availability of consumer financing could adversely affect the market for homes. Interest rates have been near historical lows for several years, which has made purchasing new factory-built homes more affordable. However, in 2022, the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee raised the target rate for the fed funds rate for the first time in three years and indicated that it foresees additional future increases in that rate in order to combat rising inflation in the U.S. economy. Potential customers may be less willing or able to pay the increased monthly costs or to obtain financing. In addition, recent increases in the prices of homes may limit consumers’ ability to obtain financing. Lenders may increase the qualifications needed for financing or adjust their terms to address any increased credit risk. These factors could adversely affect the sales or pricing of our factory-built homes. These developments have historically had, and may once again have, an adverse effect on the overall demand for factory-built housing and its competitiveness with other forms of housing and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. The liquidity provided by the GSEs and the FHA is also critical in insuring or purchasing home mortgages and creating or insuring investment securities that are either sold to investors or held in their portfolios. Any limitations or restrictions on the availability of financing by these agencies could adversely affect interest rates, financing, and our sales of new homes. Inflation could adversely affect our business and financial results. 17 Inflation can adversely affect us by increasing costs of raw materials, labor and transportation. Efforts made by the U.S. government to stimulate the economy and combat the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has increased and may continue to increase the risk of significant, persistent inflation. Inflation can also lead to higher interest rates, which can have a negative impact on the housing industry, as well as increases in our borrowing rates. While we have historically been able to pass along price increases to our customers, in a persistent inflationary environment we may not be able to raise prices sufficiently in order to maintain our margins. The availability of wholesale financing for retailers is limited due to a limited number of floor plan lenders and reduced lending limits. Factory-built housing retailers generally finance their inventory purchases with wholesale floor plan financing provided by lending institutions. The availability of wholesale financing is significantly affected by the number of floor plan lenders and their lending limits. Limited availability of floor plan lending negatively affects the inventory levels of our independent retailers, the number of retail sales center locations and related wholesale demand, and adversely affects the availability of and access to capital on an ongoing basis. As a result, if the availability of wholesale financing is reduced, we could experience sales declines or a higher level of customer defaults and our operating results and cash flows could suffer. We have contingent repurchase obligations related to wholesale financing provided to industry retailers. As is customary in the factory-built housing industry, a significant portion of our manufacturing sales to independent retailers are financed under floor plan agreements with financing companies. In connection with those floor plan financing programs, we generally have separate agreements with the financing companies that require us to repurchase homes upon default by the retailer and repossession of the homes by the financing companies. These repurchase agreements are applicable for various periods of time, generally up to 24 months after the sale of the home to the retailer. However, certain homes are subject to repurchase until the home is sold by the retailer. Our contingent repurchase obligation as of April 2, 2022, was estimated to be approximately $339.5 million, without reduction for the resale value of the homes. We may be required to honor contingent repurchase obligations in the future and may incur additional expense and reduced cash flows because of these repurchase agreements. Industry conditions and future operating results could limit our sources of capital. If we are unable to locate suitable sources of capital when needed, we may be unable to maintain or expand our business. We depend on our cash balances, cash flows from operations, and our revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) to finance our operating requirements, capital expenditures, and other needs. If our cash balances, cash flows from operations, and availability under the Credit Facility are insufficient to finance our operations and alternative capital is not available, then we may not be able to expand our business and make acquisitions, or we may need to curtail or limit our existing operations. Changes in foreign exchange rates could adversely affect the value of our investments in Canada and cause foreign exchange losses. We have substantial investments in businesses in Canada. Unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates could adversely affect the value of our investments in these businesses. An impairment of all or part of our goodwill could adversely affect our operating results and net worth. As of April 2, 2022, 15.5% of our total assets consisted of goodwill, all of which is allocated to reporting units included in the U.S. Factory-built Housing segment. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") Accounting Standards Codification (""ASC"") 350, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other (""ASC 350""), we test goodwill at least annually for impairment or more often than annually if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment is more likely than not to have occurred. If goodwill has become impaired, we charge the impairment as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs. See Item 7, ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Policies and estimates"" and Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. A write-off of all or part of our goodwill could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could harm our business and financial results. Our management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that we would prevent or detect a misstatement of our financial statements or fraud. We anticipate paying no cash dividends for the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, for the foreseeable future, to fund the development and growth of our business. As a result, capital appreciation in the price of our common stock, if any, will be investors’ only source of gain on an investment in our common stock. Any future determination to pay dividends to shareholders will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including general economic conditions, our financial condition and results of operations, our available cash and current and anticipated cash needs, capital requirements, contractual, legal, tax and regulatory 18 restrictions, the implications of the payment of dividends by us to our shareholders or by our subsidiaries to us, and any other factors that the board of directors may deem relevant. COVID-19 Pandemic Risks The COVID-19 pandemic has and may continue to materially and adversely impact our business. The global outbreak of COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. This outbreak caused a material adverse effect on the level of economic activity around the world, including in all of the markets that we serve, and prompted federal and local governments to institute preventative measures, including quarantines and shelter-in-place orders, to mitigate the public health effects. These measures caused, and may continue to cause, significant business and financial market disruption in affected areas, and had a detrimental impact to our business in the first half of fiscal 2021. In response to the outbreak, we implemented numerous measures attempting to manage and mitigate the effects of the virus on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and business. In fiscal 2022, the global economy began reopening and distribution of vaccines has encouraged greater economic activity. This, combined with high demand for new homes, resulted in our sales increasing in fiscal 2022. However, vaccination rates, hesitancy, and emergence of variants could trigger reinstatement of restrictions and shutdowns and impact our business and dampen economic activity. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to pose many risks including the following, among others: The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact us will depend on future developments that cannot be predicted, including new government actions or restrictions, new information that may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19, the longevity of COVID-19, the availability and efficacy of vaccines and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on economic activity. The COVID-19 pandemic also may have the effect of significantly heightening other risks associated with our business and our financial condition, including several of the risks disclosed below. Any future epidemic, pandemic, or similar serious public health issue, and the measures taken by governmental authorities to address it, could significantly disrupt or prevent us from operating our business in the ordinary course for an extended period. The impact of such public health issues and the related governmental actions could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and business. 19 ITEM 1B.

We also have 18 retail sales centers located across six states in the U.S. and nine terminals for our logistics operations across four states in the U.S. The corporate offices, retail sales centers, and logistics terminals are leased properties. The contractual lease for our Troy, Michigan office expires in December 2022 and the contractual lease for our Elkhart, Indiana office expires in September 2023. Two of the manufacturing facilities are encumbered by industrial revenue bonds. In the opinion of management, our properties have been well maintained, are in sound operating condition, and contain all equipment and facilities necessary to operate at present levels. We also own or lease eight idle manufacturing facilities which could be utilized for additional production capacity. Those facilities would likely require capital investments in order to secure and equip them for operations. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS We are party to certain legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course and are incidental to our business. Certain of the claims pending against us in these proceedings allege, among other things, breach of express and implied warranties, and in various governmental agency proceedings arising from occupational safety and health, wage and hour, and similar employment and workplace regulations. Although litigation is inherently uncertain, based on past experience and the information currently available, management does not believe that the currently pending and threatened litigation or claims will have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations. However, future events or circumstances, currently unknown to us, will determine whether the resolution of pending or threatened litigation or claims will ultimately have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of operations in any future reporting periods.

Overview The Company is a leading producer of factory-built housing in the U.S. and Canada. The Company serves as a complete solutions provider across complementary and vertically integrated businesses including manufactured construction, company-owned retail locations, construction services, and transportation logistics. The Company is the largest independent publicly traded factory-built solutions provider in North America based on revenue, and markets its homes under several nationally recognized brand names including Skyline Homes, Champion Home Builders, Genesis Homes, Athens Park Models, Dutch Housing, Atlantic Homes, Excel Homes, Homes of Merit, New Era, Redman Homes, ScotBilt Homes, Shore Park, Silvercrest, and Titan Homes in the U.S. and Moduline and SRI Homes in western Canada. The Company operates 36 manufacturing facilities throughout the U.S. and five manufacturing facilities in western Canada that primarily construct factory-built, timber-framed manufactured and modular houses that are sold primarily to independent retailers, builders/developers, and manufactured home community operators. The Company’s retail operations consist of 18 sales centers that sell manufactured homes to consumers primarily in the southern U.S. The Company’s transportation business engages independent owners/drivers to transport manufactured homes, recreational vehicles, and other products throughout the U.S. and Canada. Acquisitions and Expansions Over last several years, demand for the Company’s products, primarily affordable housing in the U.S., has continued to improve. As a result, the Company has focused on operational improvements to increase the capacity utilization and profitability at its existing manufacturing facilities as well as executing measured expansion of its manufacturing footprint. The Company is focused on growing in strong housing markets across the U.S. and Canada. In June, 2021, the Company acquired two idle facilities in Navasota, Texas in order to increase its production capabilities in the Texas market. The Company began production and completed the certification process at one of those facilities during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. On February 28, 2021, the Company acquired ScotBilt, which operates two manufacturing facilities in Georgia providing affordable housing throughout Alabama, Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas. ScotBilt helped to balance the Company’s national distribution and complements the Company’s existing manufacturing footprint in the attractive mid-south region. The operations of ScotBilt are included in the financial results of Skyline Champion since the date of the acquisition. During fiscal 2022, the Company completed the successful cultural, processes, systems and internal controls integration at the acquired facilities. In January, 2021, the Company acquired two idle facilities in Pembroke, North Carolina which provide an opportunity to further expand its manufacturing footprint in the Southeast markets. The Company is currently renovating one of those facilities for expected production in late fiscal 2023. The Company's acquisitions and investments are part of a strategy to grow and diversify revenue with a focus on increasing the Company’s HUD and modular homebuilding presence in the U.S. as well as improving the results of operations. These acquisitions and investments are included in the consolidated results for periods subsequent to their respective acquisition dates. Industry and Company Outlook 24 Since July 2020, U.S. and Canadian housing industry demand has been robust. The limited availability of existing homes for sale and the broader need for newly built affordable, single-family housing has continued to drive demand for new homes in these markets. In recent years, manufactured home construction experienced revenue growth due to a number of favorable demographic trends and demand drivers in the United States, including underlying growth trends in key homebuyer groups, such as the population over 55 years of age, the population of first-time home buyers, and the population of households earning less than $60,000 per year. More recently, we have seen a number of market trends pointing to increased sales of ADUs and urban-to-rural migration as customers accommodate working-from-home patterns, as well as people seeking rent-to-own single-family options. The robust demand environment has resulted in backlog at the end of fiscal 2022 of $1.6 billion compared to $858.6 million at the end of fiscal 2021. Generally, higher backlog at our manufacturing facilities creates an opportunity to increase production efficiencies. Although the higher demand brings opportunities, it also has resulted in significant increases in raw material and labor costs. In addition, we are experiencing intermittent supply disruption and higher freight costs. Finding and retaining qualified labor continues to be a challenge for our plants which requires us to review our compensation programs and adjust accordingly. We manage our business to anticipate or quickly react to these supply challenges and cost increases and generally are able to pass along increased costs to our customers. Historically, order cancellation rates have been very low, but the longer lead-time caused by larger backlogs and changing prices could result in higher cancellations in future periods. For fiscal 2022, approximately 82% of the Company’s U.S. manufacturing sales were generated from the manufacture of homes that comply with the Federal HUD code construction standard in the U.S. Industry shipments of HUD-code homes are reported on a one-month lag. According to data reported by MHI, HUD-code industry home shipments were 108,964, 95,588, and 97,553 units during fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Based on industry data, the Company’s U.S. wholesale market share of HUD code homes sold was 19.3%, 16.9%, and 16.5% in fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Annual industry shipments have generally increased each year since calendar year 2009 when only 50,000 HUD-coded manufactured homes were shipped, the lowest level since the industry began recording statistics in 1959. While shipments of HUD-coded manufactured homes have improved modestly in recent years, current manufactured housing shipments are still at lower levels than the long-term historical average of over 200,000 units per year. Manufactured home sales represent approximately nine percent of all U.S. single family home starts. COVID-19 Pandemic The outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (""COVID-19"") was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. There remains continued uncertainty regarding the extent and duration of the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on the economy, the housing market, and the Company, as well as the Company’s employees, customers, and suppliers. The Company has prioritized the safety and well-being of its employees and customers and implemented standards to operate in accordance with social-distancing protocols and public health authority guidelines. Beginning in March 2020, the Company took actions to temporarily idle certain facilities in response to government shutdown orders or reduced demand. By late April 2020, most of the temporarily idled manufacturing facilities had reopened, but at reduced production levels due to employee absenteeism, difficulty hiring new team members, and social distancing protocols. During fiscal 2021, the Company experienced intermittent closures due to COVID-19 outbreaks at the facilities or surrounding communities causing higher than normal absenteeism. In the second half of fiscal 2021, the Company was able to increase daily production rates over the levels achieved in the prior fiscal year period as direct labor staffing levels increased and production efficiencies improved. Although the Company has generally been able to navigate the production challenges caused by the pandemic in fiscal 2022, availability of labor and certain raw materials remains uncertain due to continued labor shortages and supply chain disruptions. Prices for most raw materials and components have experienced increased volatility and, overall, labor, transportation and other manufacturing costs have trended higher than prior periods. As part of the initial response to the pandemic, the Company offered extended benefits to employees, including increased sick pay and waived premium payments on healthcare benefits for furloughed employees. The Company’s U.S. operations incurred $2.2 million of expense during fiscal 2021 related to those extended benefits. Various government programs provided financial relief for affected businesses, including the Employee Retention Credit under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (""CARES Act"") and state level programs in the United States and the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (""CEWS"") under the COVID-19 Economic Response Plan in Canada. CEWS provided a cash subsidy of up to 75% of eligible employees’ remuneration, subject to certain criteria. The Company recognized $6.2 million for payroll subsidies under CEWS and $0.7 million for payroll subsidies under the CARES Act during fiscal 2021. In addition, the CARES Act allows for deferring payment of certain payroll taxes. Through December 2020, the Company deferred $11.8 million of payroll taxes, of which, the Company repaid $5.9 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2022, with the remaining amount expected to be paid in December 2022. 25 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR FISCAL 2022 VS. 2021 Year Ended (Dollars in thousands) April 2, 2022 April 3, 2021 Results of Operations Data: Net sales $ 2,207,229 $ 1,420,881 Cost of sales 1,618,106 1,133,186 Gross profit 589,123 287,695 Selling, general, and administrative expenses 256,218 178,936 Operating income 332,905 108,759 Interest expense, net 2,512 3,248 Other income, net (36 ) (5,889 ) Income from operations before income taxes 330,429 111,400 Income tax expense 82,385 26,501 Net income $ 248,044 $ 84,899 Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA: Net income $ 248,044 $ 84,899 Income tax expense 82,385 26,501 Interest expense, net 2,512 3,248 Depreciation and amortization 20,936 17,704 Equity-based compensation (for awards granted prior to December 31, 2018) — 1,359 Transaction costs — 1,044 Adjusted EBITDA $ 353,877 $ 134,755 As a percent of net sales: Gross profit 26.7 % 20.2 % Selling, general and administrative expenses 11.6 % 12.6 % Operating income 15.1 % 7.7 % Net income 11.2 % 6.0 % Adjusted EBITDA 16.0 % 9.5 % FISCAL PERIODS The Company’s fiscal year is a 52- or 53-week period that ends on the Saturday nearest March 31. Fiscal 2022 was a 52-week period and fiscal 2021 was a 53-week period. The results of operations and discussion below should be read considering the impact of an additional week of operation in the prior year. NET SALES The following table summarizes net sales for fiscal 2022 and 2021: Year Ended (Dollars in thousands) April 2, 2022 April 3, 2021 $ Change % Change Net sales $ 2,207,229 $ 1,420,881 $ 786,348 55.3 % U.S. manufacturing and retail net sales $ 1,991,066 $ 1,266,308 $ 724,758 57.2 % U.S. homes sold 24,686 19,983 4,703 23.5 % U.S. manufacturing and retail average home selling price $ 80.7 $ 63.4 $ 17.3 27.3 % Canadian manufacturing net sales $ 159,124 $ 101,328 $ 57,796 57.0 % Canadian homes sold 1,479 1,231 248 20.1 % Canadian manufacturing average home selling price $ 107.6 $ 82.3 $ 25.3 30.7 % Corporate/Other net sales $ 57,039 $ 53,245 $ 3,794 7.1 % U.S. manufacturing facilities in operation at year end 36 35 1 3 % U.S. retail sales centers in operation at year end 18 18 — — % Canadian manufacturing facilities in operation at year end 5 5 — — % 26 Net sales for fiscal 2022 were $2.2 billion an increase of $786.3 million, or 55.3%, over fiscal 2021. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. U.S. Factory-built Housing: Fiscal 2022 net sales for the Company’s U.S. manufacturing and retail operations increased by $724.8 million, or 57.2%, over fiscal 2021. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of homes sold during the period of 23.5% and an increase in the average home selling price of 27.3%. Homes sold were higher due to increased demand for our products and the impact of the acquisition of ScotBilt, partially offset by one less week of production in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021. Demand for our products increased significantly during fiscal 2022 and we have been able to increase production in response to that demand organically and through our acquisition of ScotBilt. The average selling price increased in fiscal 2022 compared to the prior fiscal year due to pricing actions enacted in response to rising material, freight, and labor costs as well as a shift in product mix to larger homes with more features and amenities. Generally, we are able to pass the increase in input costs to our customers. Canadian Factory-built Housing: The Canadian Factory-built Housing segment net sales increased by $57.8 million, or 57.0% for fiscal 2022 compared to the prior year, primarily due to a 20.1% increase in homes sold and a 30.7% increase in average selling price per new home. The increase in homes sold was driven by increased production in response to strong demand. The increase in average selling price was due to pricing actions enacted in response to rising material and labor costs. Net sales for the Canadian segment were also favorably impacted by approximately $8.2 million as the Canadian dollar strengthened relative to the U.S. dollar during fiscal 2022 as compared to the prior year. Corporate/Other: Net sales for Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation business and the elimination of intersegment sales. During fiscal 2022, net sales for the segment increased by $3.8 million, or 7.1%, compared to fiscal 2021. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in shipments of manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. GROSS PROFIT The following table summarizes gross profit for fiscal 2022 and 2021: Year Ended (Dollars in thousands) April 2, 2022 April 3, 2021 $ Change % Change Gross profit: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 530,252 $ 252,880 $ 277,372 109.7 % Canadian Factory-built Housing 43,493 21,552 21,941 101.8 % Corporate/Other 15,378 13,263 2,115 15.9 % Total gross profit $ 589,123 $ 287,695 $ 301,428 104.8 % Gross profit as a percent of net sales 26.7 % 20.2 % Gross profit as a percent of sales during fiscal 2022 was 26.7% compared to 20.2% during fiscal 2021. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. U.S. Factory-built Housing: Gross profit for the U.S. Factory-built Housing segment increased by $277.4 million, or 109.7%, during fiscal 2022 compared to the prior year. The increase in gross profit is due to the increase in revenue in fiscal 2022. As a percent of net sales, gross profit was 26.6% for fiscal 2022 compared to 20.0% in the prior fiscal year. The year-over-year increase in gross margin was primarily due to a combination of improved operational and labor efficiencies and price increases we implemented in response to rising input costs. We have focused on product simplification and material SKU rationalization to improve operational efficiencies to better leverage increased production and manufacturing fixed costs. Canadian Factory-built Housing: Gross profit for the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment increased by $21.9 million, or 101.8%, during fiscal 2022 compared to the prior year due to the increase in sales volume. Gross margin increased to 27.3% as a percent of segment net sales from 21.3% due to price increases in response to rising material and labor costs, as well as direct labor and manufacturing efficiencies from the increase in home sales volumes. Corporate/Other: 27 Gross profit for the Corporate/Other segment increased by $2.1 million, or 15.9%, during fiscal 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year. Corporate/Other gross profit improved as a percent of segment net sales to 27.0% from 24.9%. Gross margin for the Company’s transportation business improved due to a change in revenue mix. SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Selling, general, and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses include foreign currency transaction gains and losses, equity compensation, and intangible amortization expense. The following table summarizes SG&A expenses for fiscal 2022 and 2021: Year Ended (Dollars in thousands) April 2, 2022 April 3, 2021 $ Change % Change Selling, general, and administrative expenses: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 187,697 $ 126,141 $ 61,556 48.8 % Canadian Factory-built Housing 12,912 9,059 3,853 42.5 % Corporate/Other 55,609 43,736 11,873 27.1 % Total selling, general, and administrative expenses $ 256,218 $ 178,936 $ 77,282 43.2 % Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales 11.6 % 12.6 % SG&A expenses were $256.2 million during fiscal 2022, an increase of $77.3 million compared to the prior year. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. U.S. Factory-built Housing: SG&A expenses for the U.S. Factory-built Housing segment increased by $61.6 million, or 48.8%, during fiscal 2022 as compared to the prior year. SG&A expenses, as a percent of segment net sales, were 9.4% in fiscal 2022 compared to 10.0% during fiscal 2021. SG&A costs increased due to a combination of factors, primarily (i) higher sales commissions and incentive compensation, which is generally based on sales volume or a measure of profitability; (ii) higher wage expense from increased headcount as we staffed to respond to the growth in housing demand; and (iii) the impact of the acquisition of the ScotBilt operations. Canadian Factory-built Housing: SG&A expenses for the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment increased by $3.9 million, or 42.5%, during fiscal 2022 as compared to the prior year. SG&A expenses, as a percent of segment net sales, were 8.1% during fiscal 2022 compared to 8.9% in fiscal 2021. The increase in cost is generally a function of the increase in net sales and profits for the segment which translates to higher incentive compensation. Corporate/Other: SG&A expenses for Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation operations, corporate costs incurred for all segments, and intersegment eliminations. SG&A expenses for Corporate/Other increased by $11.9 million, or 27.1%, during fiscal 2022 as compared to the prior year. SG&A expenses, as a percent of segment net sales, were 97.5% during fiscal 2022 compared to 82.1% in fiscal 2021. The increase is mainly due to $5.4 mi llion of costs related to investments made to enhance our online customer experience and supporting systems, as well as an increase in equity compensation. INTEREST EXPENSE The following table summarizes the components of interest expense, net for fiscal 2022 and 2021: Year Ended (Dollars in thousands) April 2, 2022 April 3, 2021 $ Change % Change Interest expense $ 3,245 $ 3,813 $ (568 ) (14.9 %) Interest income (733 ) (565 ) (168 ) 29.7 % Interest expense, net $ 2,512 $ 3,248 $ (736 ) (22.7 %) Average outstanding floor plan payable $ 31,485 $ 26,992 Average outstanding long-term debt $ 19,155 $ 64,663 28 Interest expense, net was $2.5 million for fiscal 2022, a decrease of $0.7 million compared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily related to lower average outstanding borrowings on long-term debt, offset in part by higher average borrowings on floor plan payables. The Company repaid the outstanding balance on its revolving credit facility during the second quarter of fiscal 2022. OTHER INCOME, NET The following table summarizes other income, net for fiscal 2022 and 2021: Year Ended (Dollars in thousands) April 2, 2022 April 3, 2021 $ Change % Change Other income, net $ (36 ) $ (5,889 ) $ 5,853 (99.4 %) Other income, net decreased $5.9 million, or 99.4%, during fiscal 2022 as compared to the prior year. The decrease is due to a reduction in the wage subsidies provided by government sponsored financial assistance programs that were enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In fiscal 2021, the Company recognized $6.2 million for payroll subsidies under CEWS, and $0.7 million under the CARES Act, which were partially offset by transaction costs of $1.0 million related to the acquisition of ScotBilt. INCOME TAX EXPENSE The following table summarizes income tax expense for fiscal 2022 and 2021: Year Ended (Dollars in thousands) April 2, 2022 April 3, 2021 $ Change % Change Income tax expense $ 82,385 $ 26,501 $ 55,884 210.9 % Effective tax rate 24.9 % 23.8 % Income tax expense during fiscal 2022 was $82.4 million, representing an effective tax rate of 24.9%, compared to income tax expense of $26.5 million, representing an effective tax rate of 23.8%, in fiscal 2021. The Company’s effective tax rate for fiscal 2022 differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of 21.0%, due primarily to the effect of non-deductible expenses, tax credits, state and local income taxes, and results in foreign jurisdictions. The Company’s effective tax rate for fiscal 2021 differed from the federal statutory income tax rate of 21.0%, due primarily to the effect of non-deductible expenses, tax credits, state and local income taxes, and results in foreign jurisdictions. ADJUSTED EBITDA The following table reconciles net income, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, to Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, for fiscal 2022 and 2021: Year Ended (Dollars in thousands) April 2, 2022 April 3, 2021 $ Change % Change Net income $ 248,044 $ 84,899 $ 163,145 192.2 % Income tax expense 82,385 26,501 55,884 210.9 % Interest expense, net 2,512 3,248 (736 ) (22.7 %) Depreciation and amortization 20,936 17,704 3,232 18.3 % Equity-based compensation (for awards granted prior to December 31, 2018) — 1,359 (1,359 ) (100.0 %) Transaction costs — 1,044 (1,044 ) (100.0 %) Adjusted EBITDA $ 353,877 $ 134,755 $ 219,122 162.6 % Adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2022 was $353.9 million, an increase of $219.1 million over fiscal 2021. The increase is primarily a result of increased operating income due to increases in net sales and gross margins, partially offset by higher SG&A expenses and the reduction in wage subsidies received in the prior year. See the definition of Adjusted EBITDA under “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for additional information regarding the definition and use of this metric in evaluating the Company’s results. 29 BACKLOG Although orders from customers can be cancelled at any time without penalty, and unfilled orders are not necessarily an indication of future business, the Company’s unfilled U.S. and Canadian manufacturing orders at April 2, 2022 totaled $1.6 billion compared to $858.6 million at April 3, 2021. The increase in backlog is driven by increased demand for single-family homes which has resulted in order levels that have significantly outpaced production in both the U.S. and Canada. Our ability to increase production rates to keep pace with orders is limited by individual plant capacity, the availability of and time needed to train new employees, employee attendance and availability of materials, including certain allocations of raw materials by our suppliers. We may experience greater order cancellations in the future as a result of higher prices and the longer time required to manufacture and deliver our products. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The following table presents summary cash flow information for fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020: Year Ended (Dollars in thousands) April 2, 2022 April 3, 2021 March 28, 2020 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 224,479 $ 153,897 $ 76,743 Investing activities (31,967 ) (56,808 ) (14,093 ) Financing activities (19,936 ) (47,813 ) 21,569 Effect of exchange rate changes 256 3,850 (1,398 ) Net increase in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash 172,832 53,126 82,821 Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash at beginning of period 262,581 209,455 126,634 Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash at end of period $ 435,413 $ 262,581 $ 209,455 The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and existing cash balances. Cash balances and cash flows from operations for the next year are expected to be adequate to cover working capital requirements, capital expenditures, and strategic initiatives and investments. The Company does not have any scheduled long-term debt maturities in the next twelve months. On July 7, 2021, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement which provides for a $200.0 million revolving credit facility, including a $45.0 million letter of credit sub-facility (""Amended Credit Agreement""). At April 2, 2022, $169.6 million was available for borrowing under the Amended Credit Agreement. The Company’s revolving credit facility includes (i) a maximum consolidated total net leverage ratio of 3.25 to 1.00, subject to an upward adjustment upon the consummation of a material acquisition, and (ii) a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.00 to 1.00. The Company anticipates compliance with its debt covenants and projects its level of cash availability to be in excess of cash needed to operate the business for the next year and beyond. In the event operating cash flow and existing cash balances were deemed inadequate to support the Company’s liquidity needs, and one or more capital resources were to become unavailable, the Company would revise its operating strategies. Cash provided by operating activities was $224.5 million in fiscal 2022 compared to $153.9 million in fiscal 2021. Cash provided by operating activities increased due to higher net income in the current year, partially offset by an increase in inventory from higher material costs and higher stocking levels to mitigate supply chain challenges, and an increase in other assets primarily from the capitalization of $20.5 million of cloud computing costs. Cash provided by operating activities was $153.9 million in fiscal 2021 compared to $76.7 million in fiscal 2020. Cash was generated by operating income (before non-cash charges) from higher sales and operating margins compared to the prior year. Operating cash was also favorably impacted by changes in other working capital items, primarily an increase in customer deposits of $36.4 million. We generally collect a deposit at the time an order is placed by a customer. The significant increase in backlog drove the increase in deposits. The favorable changes in working capital items were partially offset by an increase in inventory compared to the prior period. Cash used in investing activities was $32.0 million in fiscal 2022 versus $56.8 million in fiscal 2021. The decrease is primarily related to the cash paid for the acquisition of ScotBilt, net of cash acquired, of $52.5 million, in fiscal 2021, partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures compared to the prior year. The Company acquired two idle manufacturing facilities in Texas in fiscal 2022 and made investments in plant improvements to facilitate increased production and operational efficiencies. Cash used in investing activities was $56.8 million in fiscal 2021 versus $14.1 million in fiscal 2020. The increase is primarily related to the cash paid for the acquisition of ScotBilt, net of cash acquired, of $52.5 million, partially offset by a decrease in capital expenditures compared to the prior year. 30 In fiscal 2022, cash used in financing activities was $19.9 million, versus $47.8 million in the prior fiscal year. The decrease in cash used for financing activities was primarily related to lower repayments during fiscal 2022 of the Company's previously existing revolving credit facility and an increase in floor plan financing. In fiscal 2021, cash used in financing activities was $47.8 million, versus the prior year which had net cash provided by financing activities of $21.6 million. Cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2021 is primarily a result of payments made on the revolving credit facility and floor plan financing facilities totaling $38.0 million and $8.2 million, respectively. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS Credit Facility The Amended Credit Agreement matures in July 2026 and has no scheduled amortization. The interest rate on borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement adjusts based on the consolidated total net leverage of the Company from a high of the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (""LIBOR"") plus 1.875% and Alternative Base Rate (""ABR"") plus 0.875%, at the election of the Company, when the consolidated total net leverage ratio is equal to or greater than 2.25:1.00, to a low of LIBOR plus 1.125% and ABR plus 0.125% when the consolidated total net leverage is below 0.50:1.00. In addition, the Company is obligated to pay an unused line fee ranging between 0.15% and 0.30% (depending on the consolidated total net leverage ratio) in respect of unused commitments under the Amended Credit Agreement. Letter of Credit Facility The Company has a letter of credit sub-facility under the Amended Credit Agreement. At April 2, 2022, letters of credit issued under the sub-facility totaled $30.4 million. Industrial Revenue Bonds Obligations under industrial revenue bonds are supported by letters of credit and bear interest based on a municipal bond index rate. The industrial revenue bonds require lump-sum payments of principal upon maturity in 2029. Floor Plan Payable At April 2, 2022, the Company had outstanding borrowings on floor plan financing arrangements of $35.5 million. The Company’s retail operations utilize floor plan financing to fund the acquisition of manufactured homes for display or resale. The arrangements provide for borrowings up to $67.0 million. Borrowings are secured by the homes acquired and are required to be repaid when the Company sells the financed home to a customer. Contingent Obligations The Company has contingent liabilities and obligations at April 2, 2022, including surety bonds and letters of credit totaling $35.6 million and $30.4 million, respectively. Additionally, the Company is contingently obligated under repurchase agreements with certain lending institutions that provide floor plan financing to independent retailers. The contingent repurchase obligation as of April 2, 2022 is approximately $339.5 million, without reduction for the resale value of the homes. The Company has the ability to resell the repurchased collateral to other retailers, and losses incurred on repurchased homes have been insignificant in recent periods. The reserve for estimated losses under repurchase agreements was $2.3 million at April 2, 2022. See “ Critical Accounting Polices and Estimates – Reserve for Repurchase Commitments ” below. The Company has provided various representations, warranties, and other standard indemnifications in the ordinary course of its business in agreements to acquire and sell business assets and in financing arrangements. The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of its business. In the normal course of business, the Company’s subsidiaries historically provided certain parent company guarantees to two U.K. customers. These guarantees provided contractual liability for proven construction defects up to 12 years from the date of delivery of the units. The guarantees remain a contingent liability subsequent to the fiscal 2017 disposition of the U.K. operations, which declines over time through October 2027. As of the date of this report, no claims have been reported under the terms of the guarantees. Management believes the ultimate liability with respect to these contingent obligations will not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES - ADJUSTED EBITDA The Company defines Adjusted Earnings Before Interest Taxes and Depreciation and Amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”) as net income or loss plus; (a) the provision for income taxes; (b) interest expense, net; (c) depreciation and amortization; (d) gain or loss from discontinued operations; (e) equity based compensation for awards granted prior to December 31, 2018; (f) non-cash 31 restructuring charges and impairment of assets; and (g) other non-operating costs including those for the acquisition and integration or disposition of businesses and idle facilities. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of earnings calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income or loss prepared on a U.S. GAAP basis. Adjusted EBITDA does not purport to represent cash flow provided by, or used in, operating activities as defined by U.S. GAAP, which is presented in the Statement of Cash Flows. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is presented as a supplemental measure of the Company’s financial performance that management believes is useful to investors, because the excluded items may vary significantly in timing or amounts and/or may obscure trends useful in evaluating and comparing the Company’s operating activities across reporting periods. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA is useful to an investor in evaluating operating performance for the following reasons: (i) Adjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors to measure a company’s operating performance without regard to items such as interest income and expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization and equity-based compensation, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and the book value of assets, capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired; and (ii) analysts and investors use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to evaluate the overall operating performance of companies in the industry. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA for planning purposes, including the preparation of internal annual operating budget and periodic forecasts: (i) in communications with the board of directors and investors concerning financial performance; (ii) as a factor in determining bonuses under management’s annual incentive compensation program; and (iii) as a measure of operating performance used to determine the ability to provide cash flows to support investments in capital assets, acquisitions and working capital requirements for operating expansion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1, ""Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,"" to the consolidated financial statements included in this Report. Certain of our accounting policies require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Assumptions and estimates of future earnings and cash flow are used in the periodic analyses of the recoverability of goodwill, intangible assets, deferred tax assets and property, plant, and equipment. Historical experience and trends are used to estimate reserves, including reserves for self-insured risks, warranty costs, and wholesale repurchase losses. The Company considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the estimate would have had a significant impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. The Company believes that the following discussion addresses the Company’s critical accounting estimates. Acquisitions We allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the assets and liabilities, if any, is recorded as goodwill. We use all available information to estimate fair values. We typically engage outside appraisal firms to assist in the fair value determination of identifiable intangible assets and any other significant assets or liabilities. We adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation, as necessary, up to one year after the acquisition closing date as we obtain more information regarding asset valuations and liabilities assumed. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but that are inherently uncertain, and therefore, may not be realized. Unanticipated events or circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy of our fair value estimates, including assumptions regarding industry economic factors and business strategies. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the estimates, assumptions, and values reflected in the valuations will be realized, and actual results could vary materially. Reserves for Self-Insured Risks The Company is self-insured for a significant portion of its general insurance, product liability, workers’ compensation, auto, health, and property insurance. Insurance coverage is maintained for catastrophic exposures and those risks required to be insured by law. The Company is liable for the first $150,000 of incurred losses for each workers’ compensation and auto liability claim and is responsible for losses up to the first $500,000 per occurrence for general, product liability, and property insurance. Generally catastrophic losses are insured up to $80 million. The Company establishes reserves for reported and unreported losses, and insurance company reimbursements, under these programs using an actuarial determined value which takes into consideration prior claim experience, estimates of losses for known occurrences and the respective volume of business activity for a given period. The health plan is currently subject to a stop-loss limit of $600,000 per occurrence. Estimated self-insurance costs are accrued for all expected future expenditures for reported and unreported claims based on historical experience. Warranty Reserves The Company’s factory-built housing operations generally provide each retail homebuyer or builder/developer with a 12-month assurance warranty from the date of retail purchase. Estimated warranty costs are accrued as cost of sales at the time of sale. Warranty provisions and reserves are based on various factors, including estimates of the amounts necessary to settle existing and future claims 32 on homes sold as of the balance sheet date. Factors used in the estimation of the warranty liability include the estimated amount of warranty and customer service costs incurred for homes that remain in retailers’ inventories before delivery to the consumer, homes purchased by consumers still within the warranty period, the timing in which work orders were completed, and the historical average costs incurred to service a home. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets It is the Company’s policy to evaluate the recoverability of property, plant, and equipment whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable, primarily based on estimated selling price, appraised value, or projected undiscounted future cash flows. Impairment of Goodwill Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually. Impairment testing is required more often if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment is more likely than not to have occurred. In conducting its annual impairment testing, the Company may first perform a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount. If not, no further goodwill impairment testing is required. If it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount, or if the Company elects not to perform a qualitative assessment of a reporting unit, the Company then compares the fair value of the reporting unit to the related net book value. If the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is measured and recognized. As the analysis depends upon judgments, estimates and assumptions, such testing is subject to inherent uncertainties, which could cause the fair value to fluctuate from period to period. In fiscal 2022, the Company performed qualitative assessments of its reporting units. The annual assessment was completed on of the first day of fiscal March. The assessments indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded its respective carrying value. The Company does not believe that any reporting units are at risk for impairment. Income Taxes and Deferred Tax Assets Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided when the Company determines that it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Reserve for Repurchase Commitments As is customary in the factory-built housing industry, a significant portion of the home sales to independent retailers are made pursuant to repurchase agreements with lending institutions that provide wholesale floor plan financing to the retailers. Certain homes sold pursuant to repurchase agreements are subject to repurchase, generally up to 24 months after the sale of the home to the retailer. Certain other homes sold pursuant to repurchase agreements are subject to repurchase until the home is sold by the retailer. For those homes with an unlimited repurchase period, the Company’s risk of loss upon repurchase declines due to required monthly principal payments by the retailer. After 18 to 36 months from the date of the Company’s sale of the home, the risk of loss on these homes is low, and by the 46th month, most programs require that the home be paid in full, at which time the Company no longer has risk of loss. Pursuant to these agreements, during the repurchase period, generally upon default by the retailer and repossession by the financial institution, the Company is obligated to repurchase the homes from the floor plan lenders. The contingent repurchase obligation as of April 2, 2022 is estimated to be approximately $339.5 million, without reduction for the resale value of the homes. Losses under repurchase obligations represent the difference between the repurchase price and net proceeds from the resale of the homes, less accrued rebates, which will not be paid. Losses incurred on homes repurchased have been insignificant in recent periods. The reserve for estimated losses under repurchase agreements was $2.3 million at April 2, 2022. OTHER MATTERS Inflation Inflation of raw materials, especially commodities such as forest products, was significant during fiscal 2022. The raw material price increases have generally been passed on to customers or mitigated through working with supply chain partners, sourcing alternative materials or other operational improvements to minimize the effect on profitability. However, continued, frequent and sudden increases in specific costs, as well as price competition, can affect the ability to pass on costs and adversely impact results of operations. Therefore, there is no assurance that inflation or the impact of rising material costs will not have a significant impact on revenue or results of operations in the future. Seasonality The housing industry, which includes factory-built homes, is affected by seasonality. Sales during the period from March to November are traditionally higher than other months. As a result, quarterly results of a particular period are not necessarily representative of the results expected for the year. 33 Recently Issued Accounting Standards Refer to Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” in our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding new accounting pronouncements. 34 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITAT IVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Risk Debt obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement are subject to variable rates of interest based on LIBOR and ABR, at the election of the Company. A 100 basis point increase in the underlying interest rate would result in an additional annual interest expense of approximately $0.2 million, assuming related debt of $19.2 million, which is the amount of average outstanding borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement during the year ended April 2, 2022. Obligations under industrial revenue bonds are subject to variable rates of interest based on a municipal bond index rate. A 100 basis point increase in the underlying interest rates would result in additional annual interest expense of approximately $0.1 million, assuming related debt of $12.4 million, which is the amount of outstanding borrowings on industrial revenue bonds at April 2, 2022. Obligations under floor plan financing arrangements are subject to variable rates of interest based on terms negotiated with the floor plan lenders. A 100 basis point increase in the underlying interest rates would result in additional annual interest expense of approximately $0.4 million, assuming related floor plan borrowings of $35.5 million, which is the amount of outstanding borrowings on floor plan financing at April 2, 2022. The Company’s approach to interest rate risk is to balance borrowings between fixed rate and variable rate debt as management deems appropriate. At April 2, 2022, the Company’s borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement, industrial revenue bonds and floor plan financing arrangements were all at variable rates. Foreign Exchange Risk The Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk with its factory-built housing operations in Canada. The Canadian operations had fiscal 2022 net sales of $199.5 million Canadian dollars. Assuming future annual Canadian net sales equivalent to fiscal 2022, a change of 1.0% in exchange rates between the U.S. and Canadian dollars would change consolidated sales by $2.0 million. The Company also has foreign exchange risk for cash balances maintained in Canadian dollars that are subject to fluctuating values when exchanged into U.S. dollars. The Company does not financially hedge its investment in the Canadian operations or in Canadian denominated bank deposits. ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMEN TS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Financial statements and supplementary data are filed herewith under Item 15. ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCO UNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES The Company’s management, with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of April 2, 2022. Based on that evaluation, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of April 2, 2022. The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, internal controls over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 35 Because of its inherent limitations, the Company's controls and procedures may not prevent or detect misstatements. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all controls systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (""2013 Framework""). Based on management's evaluation under the criteria in the 2013 Framework, management concluded that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of April 2, 2022. Ernst & Young LLP, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, audited the Company’s consolidated financial statements set forth in this Annual Report and issued an attestation report regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of April 2, 2022, and the attestation report is set forth in Item 15, ""Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,"" under the caption ""Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control over Financial Reporting"" and is incorporated herein by reference. There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended April 2, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at April 2, 2022 and April 3, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the fiscal years ended April 2, 2022, April 3, 2021, and March 28, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of April 2, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated May 24, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company‘s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company‘s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts and disclosures to which it relates. F- 2 Workers’ Compensation Description of the Matter The Company had workers’ compensation reserves of $19.8 million as of April 2, 2022. As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company is self-insured for a significant portion of its workers’ compensation obligations. Workers’ compensation costs are accrued for incurred claims and estimated claims incurred but not yet reported. Auditing the Company’s workers’ compensation reserve is complex and requires the involvement of actuarial specialists due to the measurement uncertainty associated with the estimate of the ultimate loss projection and the use of various actuarial methods. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company's controls over the workers' compensation reserve process. For example, we tested controls over management's review of the workers' compensation reserve calculations, the appropriateness of the assumptions management used in the calculation and controls pertaining to the completeness and accuracy of the claim data underlying the reserve. To evaluate the reserve for workers' compensation, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, testing the completeness and accuracy of the incurred claims underlying the reserve, obtaining legal confirmation letters to evaluate reserves in consideration of litigated matters, and reviewing the Company's reinsurance contracts to assess the Company's self-insurance retentions. Furthermore, we involved our actuarial specialists to assist in our evaluation of methodologies and assumptions applied by management to establish the workers' compensation reserve. We compared the Company's reserve to a range developed by our actuarial specialists based on assumptions independently developed by our specialists. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP We have served as the Company‘s auditor since 2006. Detroit, Michigan May 24, 2022 F- 3 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Skyline Champion Corporation Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have audited Skyline Champion Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of April 2, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Skyline Champion Corporation (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of April 2, 2022, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of April 2, 2022 and April 3, 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), equity and cash flows for each of the fiscal years ended April 2, 2022, April 3, 2021, and March 28, 2020, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) and our report dated May 24, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP Detroit, Michigan May 24, 2022 F- 4 Skyline Champion Corporation Consolida ted Balance Sheets (Dollars and shares in thousands, except per share amounts) April 2, 2022 April 3, 2021 ASSETS Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 435,413 $ 262,581 Trade accounts receivable, net 90,536 57,481 Inventories, net 241,334 166,113 Other current assets 14,977 13,592 Total current assets 782,260 499,767 Long-term assets: Property, plant, and equipment, net 132,985 115,140 Goodwill 191,970 191,803 Amortizable intangible assets, net 51,283 58,835 Deferred tax assets 17,750 19,914 Other noncurrent assets 58,371 32,443 Total assets $ 1,234,619 $ 917,902 LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY Current liabilities: Floor plan payable $ 35,460 $ 25,733 Accounts payable 92,159 57,214 Other current liabilities 222,493 180,695 Total current liabilities 350,112 263,642 Long-term liabilities: Long-term debt 12,430 39,330 Deferred tax liabilities 5,124 4,280 Other liabilities 41,840 42,039 Total long-term liabilities 59,394 85,649 Stockholders' Equity: Common stock, $ 0.0277 par value, 115,000 shares authorized, 56,838 and 56,640 shares issued as of April 2, 2022 and April 3, 2021, respectively. 1,573 1,569 Additional paid-in capital 502,846 491,668 Retained earnings 327,902 82,898 Accumulated other comprehensive loss ( 7,208 ) ( 7,524 ) Total equity 825,113 568,611 Total liabilities and stockholders' equity $ 1,234,619 $ 917,902 See accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

See accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. F- 9 Skyline Champion Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Nature of Operations: The Company’s operations consist of manufacturing, retail and transportation activities. At April 2, 2022 , the Company operated 36 manufacturing facilities throughout the United States (“U.S.”) and five manufacturing facilities in western Canada that primarily construct factory-built, timber-framed manufactured and modular houses that are sold primarily to independent retailers, builders/developers, and manufactured home community operators. The Company’s retail operations consist of 18 sales centers that sell manufactured houses to consumers primarily in the Southern U.S. The Company’s transportation business engages independent owners/drivers to transport recreational vehicles throughout the U.S. and Canada and manufactured houses in certain regions of the U.S. The Company also has holding companies located in the Netherlands. Principles of Consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Accounting Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“US. GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto. Estimates made in preparing the accompanying consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, business combinations, reserves for obsolete inventory, accrued warranty costs, useful lives of fixed and intangible assets, asset impairment analyses, insurance reserves, legal reserves, repurchase reserves, share-based compensation and deferred tax valuation allowances. Actual results could differ from those estimates, making it reasonably possible that a change in these estimates could occur within one year. Fiscal Year: The Company’s fiscal year is a 52- or 53-week period that ends on the Saturday nearest March 31. Fiscal 2022 and 2020 include the 52-weeks ended April 2, 2022 and March 28, 2020, respectively. Fiscal 2021 includes the 53-weeks ended April 3, 2021 . COVID-19 Government Financial Assistance: The outbreak of COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. In response to the pandemic, the Company offered extended benefits to employees, including increased sick pay and waived premium payments on healthcare benefits for furloughed employees. The Company’s U.S. operations incurred $2.2 million of expense related to those extended benefits in fiscal 2021. Various government programs provided financial relief for affected businesses, including the Employee Retention Credit under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (""CARES Act"") and state level programs in the United States and the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (""CEWS"") under the COVID-19 Economic Response Plan in Canada. The Company recognized $ 6.2 million for payroll subsidies under CEWS during fiscal 2021 and $ 0.7 million for payroll subsidies under the CARES Act during fiscal 2021. In addition, the CARES Act allows for deferring payment of certain payroll taxes. Through December 2020 the Company deferred $ 11.8 million of payroll taxes. The Company repaid $ 5.9 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2022, with the remaining amount expected to be paid in December 2022. Revenue Recognition: Revenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of a contract are satisfied which generally occurs at a point in time through the transfer of control of promised goods to the Company's customers. Control transfers once a customer has the ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the benefits from, the product. This includes the transfer of legal title, physical possession, the risks and rewards of ownership, and customer acceptance. Sales revenue is reported net of applicable sales tax. See Note 9, Revenue Recognition, for additional information. Cost of Sales: Cost of sales includes manufacturing costs such as: (i) materials; (ii) compensation and employee benefits for direct and indirect labor; (iii) fixed and variable manufacturing overhead costs; (iv) warranty costs; (v) inbound delivery costs; and (vi) depreciation of buildings and equipment. Manufacturing overhead costs include costs such as: (i) utilities; (ii) workers’ compensation and product liability self-insurance; (iii) real and personal property taxes on buildings and equipment; (iv) manufacturing supplies; (v) repairs and maintenance; and (vi) rents and leases for buildings and equipment. Cost of sales also includes certain post-manufacturing costs, to the extent such costs are the Company’s responsibility. Post-manufacturing costs may include delivery and setup, foundations, craning, roofing, exterior cladding, interior finishing, utility connections and other miscellaneous site costs. Generally, subcontractors are engaged to perform post-manufacturing activities. Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses: Selling, general, and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) include costs such as (i) salaries, wages, incentives and employee benefits for executive, management, sales, engineering, accounting, information technology (“IT”) and administrative employees; (ii) sales commissions; (iii) marketing and advertising costs; (iv) legal and professional fees; (v) depreciation, rents and leases for administrative facilities, office equipment, IT equipment and computer software; and (vi) postage, office supplies, travel and telephone expenses. F- 10 Advertising Costs and Delivery Costs and Revenue : Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and are included in selling, general, and administrative expenses. Total advertising expense was approximately $ 1.8 million , $ 1.7 million , and $ 2.3 million for fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020 , respectively. Delivery costs are included in cost of sales and delivery revenue is included in net sales. Foreign Currency: Translation adjustments of the Company’s international subsidiaries for which the local currency is the functional currency are reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. F air Value: The Company estimates the fair value of its financial instruments in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement , which establishes a fair value hierarchy and requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. As such, the fair value of financial instruments is estimated using available market information and other valuation methods. The Company groups assets and liabilities at fair value in three levels, based on the inputs and assumptions used to determine fair value. These levels are: The Company records accounts receivable, accounts payable and other current liabilities at cost. The carrying value of these instruments approximate their fair value due to their short-term maturities. Cash and Cash Equivalents : Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments that have original maturities less than 90 days at the time of their purchase. These investments are carried at cost, which approximates market value because of their short maturities. Restricted cash was $0.1 million at April 2, 2022 and April 3, 2021. Allowance for Credit Losses: The Company extends credit terms on a customer-by-customer basis in the normal course of business and, as such, trade accounts receivable are subject to customary credit risk. The Company’s allowance for credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost reflects management’s estimate of credit losses over the remaining expected life of such assets, measured primarily using historical experience, as well as current economic conditions and forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. Expected credit losses for newly recognized financial assets, as well as changes to expected credit losses during the period, are recognized in earnings. At April 2, 2022 and April 3, 2021, accounts receivable are reflected net of reserves of $ 1.7 million and $ 0.4 million, respectively. Other notes receivable are reflected net of reserves of $ 0.4 million at both April 2, 2022 and April 3, 2021 . Inventories : Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost determined under the first-in, first-out method. Capitalized manufacturing costs include the cost of materials, labor and manufacturing overhead. Retail inventories of new manufactured homes built by the Company are valued at manufacturing cost, including materials, labor and manufacturing overhead, or net purchase price if acquired from unaffiliated third parties. Property, Plant, and Equipment : Property, plant, and equipment are stated at acquisition date cost. Depreciation is provided principally on the straight-line method, generally over the following estimated useful lives: land improvements— 3 to 10 years ; buildings and improvements— 8 to 25 years ; and vehicles and machinery and equipment— 3 to 8 years . At April 2, 2022 , the Company owned or leased eight idle manufacturing facilities and two idle retail sales centers with a net book value of $ 9.9 million . These properties are accounted for as long-lived assets to be held and used. It is the Company’s policy to evaluate the recoverability of property, plant, and equipment whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable. If impairment indicators exist, the Company performs the required impairment analysis by comparing the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the long-lived assets to the related net book values. If the net book value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is measured and recognized. An impairment loss is measured as the difference between the net book value and the fair value of the long-lived assets. Fair value is estimated based upon a combination of market and cost approaches, as appropriate. An impairment loss of $ 0.6 million was recorded in selling, general, and administrative expenses in fiscal 2020 related to a decrease in the estimated fair value of the Company’s idle manufacturing facilities. No impairment losses were recorded in either fiscal 2022 or 2021. Leases: The Company has operating leases for land, manufacturing and office facilities, and equipment. The Company’s lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such option. F- 11 The Company's leases do not contain material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease terms. The Company has elected not to recognize any right of use asset or lease liability for leases with an initial term of 12 months or less and has elected not to separate lease and non-lease components. The discount rate used to measure a lease obligation should be the rate implicit in the lease; however, the Company’s operating leases generally do not provide an implicit rate. Accordingly, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate at lease commencement to determine the present value of lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is an entity-specific rate which represents the rate of interest a lessee would pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term with similar payments. Assets held for sale: Long-lived assets expected to be sold or otherwise disposed of within one year are classified as assets held for sale and included in other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company acquired an office building which was classified as an asset held for sale as of March 30, 2019, valued at $ 2.1 million. In the first quarter of fiscal 2020, a loss of $ 1.0 million was recorded in selling, general, and administrative expenses to recognize a decrease in the fair value of the building, which was sold for $ 1.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2020. Goodwill : The Company tests goodwill for impairment in accordance with ASC 350. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment on at least an annual basis. Impairment testing is required more often than annually if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment is more likely than not to have occurred. In conducting its annual impairment testing, the Company may first perform a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount. If not, no further goodwill impairment testing is required. If it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount, or if the Company elects not to perform a qualitative assessment of a reporting unit, the Company then compares the fair value of the reporting unit to the related net book value. If the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is measured and recognized. In fiscal 2022 , the Company performed qualitative assessments of its reporting units. The annual assessment was completed on the first day of fiscal March. The assessment indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded its respective carrying value. The Company does not believe that any reporting units are at risk for impairment. Business combinations: The Company accounts for its business combinations in accordance with the accounting guidance in ASC 805. The purchase price of an acquired business is allocated to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the assets and liabilities, if any, is recorded as goodwill. Determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management’s judgment, the utilization of independent appraisal firms and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the timing and amount of future cash flows, market rate assumptions, actuarial assumptions, and appropriate discount rates, among other items. Refer to Note 2, Business Combination, for additional information. Amortizable Intangible Assets : Amortizable intangible assets consist primarily of fair values assigned to customer relationships and trade names. Trade names were valued based upon the relief-from-royalty method and customer relationships were valued based upon the multi-period excess earnings method. Amortization is provided over the useful lives of the intangible assets, generally up to ten years , using the straight-line method. The recoverability of amortizable intangible assets is evaluated whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recovered, in accordance with the recognition and measurement provisions of ASC 360. Warranty Obligations : The Company’s manufactured housing operations generally provides the homebuyer with an assurance warranty from the date of respective purchase. Estimated warranty costs are accrued as cost of sales at the time of sale. Warranty provisions and reserves are based on estimates of the amounts necessary to settle existing and future claims on homes sold by the manufacturing segment as of the balance sheet date. Factors used to calculate the warranty obligation are the estimated number of homes still under warranty and the historical average costs incurred to service a home. Dealer Volume Rebates : The Company’s manufacturing segment sponsors volume rebate programs under which sales to retailers and builder/developers can qualify for cash rebates generally based on the level of sales attained during a twelve-month period. Volume rebates are accrued at the time of sale and are recorded as a reduction of net sales. Repurchase Agreements: The Company is contingently liable under terms of repurchase agreements with lending institutions that provide wholesale floor plan financing to retailers. These arrangements, which are customary in the industry, provide for the repurchase of products sold to retailers in the event of default by the retailer on their agreement to pay the financial institution. The risk of loss from these agreements is spread over numerous retailers. The repurchase price is generally determined by the original sales price of the product less contractually defined curtailment payments. The Company accounts for the guarantee under its repurchase agreements with the retailers’ financing institutions by estimating and deferring a portion of the related product sale that represents the estimated fair value of the guarantee. F- 12 Accrued Self-Insurance : The Company is self-insured for a significant portion of its workers’ compensation, general and product liability, auto liability, health, and property insurance. Insurance coverage is maintained for catastrophic exposures and those risks required to be insured by law. Estimated self-insurance costs are accrued for incurred claims and estimated claims incurred but not yet reported. At April 2, 2022 and April 3, 2021 , the Company had gross reserves for estimated losses related to workers’ compensation obligations of $ 19.8 million and $ 16.3 million, respectively. The Company also recorded expected reimbursements for the portion of those losses above respective program limits of $ 7.4 million and $ 5.2 million at April 2, 2022 and April 3, 2021 , respectively. Equity-Based Compensation: Stock-based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is generally recognized as expense ratably on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. Forfeitures are recognized in the period in which they occur. Comprehensive Income and Loss: Components of comprehensive income and loss are changes in equity other than those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners. The aggregate amount of such changes to equity that have not yet been recognized in net income or loss are reported in the equity section of the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, net of tax. Income Taxes : The provision for income taxes is calculated using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent upon the generation of future taxable income. In determining the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns, judgment is required. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Pending Adoption: There were no accounting standards recently issued that are expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations. ScotBilt Acquisition On February 28, 202 1, the Company acquired 100 % of the membership interests of ScotBilt Homes, LLC and related companies (“ScotBilt”), a builder of manufactured homes with annual revenues of approximately $ 79.0 million, for a purchase price of $ 53.0 million. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, the purchase price was adjusted for cash held by ScotBilt at the closing date and working capital adjustments resulting in an initial purchase consideration of $ 54.5 million. In the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company reduced the preliminary purchase price allocation by $ 0.2 million as a result of the final working capital settlement. The Company accounted for the acquisition as a business combination under the acquisition method of accounting provided by FASB ASC 805, Business Combinations (“ASC 805”). As such, the purchase price was allocated to the net assets acquired, inclusive of intangible assets, with the excess fair value recorded to goodwill. The allocation of the purchase price was as follows: (Dollars in thousands) Cash $ 1,521 Trade accounts receivable 2,256 Inventory 6,752 Property, plant, and equipment 10,466 Other assets 1,164 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities ( 7,432 ) Intangibles 21,100 Goodwill 18,449 Total purchase price allocation $ 54,276 Goodwill is primarily attributable to expected synergies from the combination of the companies, including, but not limited to, expected cost synergies through procurement activities and operational improvements through sharing of best practices. Goodwill, which is deductible for income tax purposes, was allocated to the U.S. Factory-built Housing reporting unit. Cash, trade accounts receivable, inventory, other assets, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities were generally stated at historical carrying values given the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities. Intangible assets include $ 13.0 million in customer relationships and $ 8.1 million associated with the ScotBilt trade name and were based on an independent appraisal. The fair value of the customer relationships was determined using the multi-period excess earnings method and the fair value of the trade name was F- 13 determined using the relief-from-royalty method. The Company estimates that each intangible asset has a weighted average useful life of ten years from the acquisition date. Fair value estimates of property, plant, and equipment were based on independent appraisals, giving consideration to the highest and best use of the assets. Key assumptions used in the appraisals were based on a combination of market, cost, and sales comparison approaches, as appropriate. Level 3 fair value estimates of $ 10.5 million related to property, plant, and equipment and $ 21.1 million related to intangible assets were recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of the acquisition date. For further information on acquired assets measured at fair value, see Note 5, Goodwill and Intangible Assets. The acquisition of ScotBilt was a taxable business combination. Therefore, the Company’s tax basis in the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed approximate the respective fair values at the acquisition date. The components of inventory, net of reserves for obsolete inventory, were as follows: (Dollars in thousands) April 2, 2022 April 3, 2021 Raw materials $ 141,238 $ 91,916 Work in process 26,523 21,642 Finished goods and other 73,573 52,555 Total inventories $ 241,334 $ 166,113 At April 2, 2022 and April 3, 2021, reserves for obsolete inventory were $ 4.8 million and $ 4.6 million , respectively. Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated primarily on the straight-line method, generally over the following estimated useful lives: land improvements – 3 to 10 years ; buildings and improvements – 8 to 25 years ; and vehicles and machinery and equipment – 3 to 8 years . Depreciation expense for the fiscal years ended April 2, 2022, April 3, 2021, and March 28, 2020 was $ 13.4 million , $ 12.1 million , and $ 13.1 million , respectively. The components of property, plant, and equipment were as follows: (Dollars in thousands) April 2, 2022 April 3, 2021 Land and improvements $ 39,815 $ 36,470 Buildings and improvements 104,085 97,005 Machinery and equipment 69,518 57,790 Construction in progress 10,280 1,889 Property, plant, and equipment, at cost 223,698 193,154 Less accumulated depreciation ( 90,713 ) ( 78,014 ) Property, plant, and equipment, net $ 132,985 $ 115,140 Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. At April 2, 2022 and April 3, 2021, the Company had goodwill of $ 192.0 million and $ 191.8 million , respectively. The change in the goodwill balance during the period was a result of the final working capital settlement in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 related to the acquisition of ScotBilt. Goodwill is allocated to reporting units included in the U.S. Factory-built Housing segment, which include the Company’s U.S. manufacturing and retail operations. Intangible Assets F- 14 The components of amortizable intangible assets were as follows: (Dollars in thousands) April 2, 2022 April 3, 2021 Customer Relationships Trade Names Total Customer Relationships Trade Names Total Gross carrying amount $ 61,986 $ 21,419 $ 83,405 $ 61,963 $ 21,409 $ 83,372 Accumulated amortization ( 23,819 ) ( 8,303 ) ( 32,122 ) ( 18,158 ) ( 6,379 ) ( 24,537 ) Amortizable intangibles, net $ 38,167 $ 13,116 $ 51,283 $ 43,805 $ 15,030 $ 58,835 Weighted average remaining amortization period, in years 6.8 6.9 6.8 7.8 7.9 7.8 The Company recognized customer relationships of $ 13.0 million and trade names of $ 8.1 million related to the acquisition of ScotBilt. The fair value of the customer relationship intangible asset was estimated using the multi-period excess earnings method of the income approach. The fair value of the customer relationship intangible asset was determined based on estimates and assumptions of projected cash flows attributable to the acquired customer relationships, the annual attrition rate of existing customer relationships, the contributory asset charges attributable to the assets that support the customer relationships, such as: (i) net working capital; (ii) property, plant, and equipment; (iii) trade names; and (iv) workforce, with the economic life and the discount rate as determined at the time of the acquisition. The fair value of the trade names intangible asset was estimated using the relief-from-royalty method of the income approach. The fair value of the trade names intangible asset was determined based on estimates and assumptions of the expected life of the intangible asset, the royalty rate, and the discount rate that reflects the level of risk associated with the future cash flows, as determined at the time of the acquisition. Amortization of intangible assets for the fiscal years ended April 2, 2022, April 3, 2021, and March 28, 2020 was $ 7.6 million , $ 5.6 million , and $ 5.4 million respectively. Estimated amortization expense of intangible assets over the next five years is estimated to be (dollars in thousands): Fiscal 2023 $ 7,436 Fiscal 2024 7,388 Fiscal 2025 7,388 Fiscal 2026 7,388 Fiscal 2027 7,346 Cloud Computing Arrangements The Company capitalizes costs associated with the development of cloud computing arrangements in a manner consistent with internally developed software. At April 2, 2022 and April 3, 2021, the Company had capitalized cloud computing costs of $ 20.5 million and $ 0.3 million, respectively. Cloud computing costs are included in other noncurrent assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Amortization of capitalized cloud computing costs was $ 0.2 million for the fiscal year ended April 2, 2022. There was no amortization of capitalized cloud computing costs during fiscal 2021 as the related systems had not yet been placed in service. The components of other current liabilities were as follows: (Dollars in thousands) April 2, 2022 April 3, 2021 Customer deposits $ 67,396 $ 58,888 Accrued volume rebates 23,505 18,207 Accrued warranty obligations 25,806 24,033 Accrued compensation and payroll taxes 64,888 42,560 Accrued insurance 13,569 12,421 Other 27,329 24,586 Total other current liabilities $ 222,493 $ 180,695 F- 15 Changes in the accrued warranty obligations were as follows: Year Ended (Dollars in thousands) April 2, 2022 April 3, 2021 Balance at the beginning of the period $ 30,469 $ 24,969 Warranty assumed in the acquisition of ScotBilt — 1,996 Warranty expense 43,314 37,620 Cash warranty payments ( 40,951 ) ( 34,116 ) Balance at end of period 32,832 30,469 Less noncurrent portion in other long-term liabilities ( 7,026 ) ( 6,436 ) Total current portion $ 25,806 $ 24,033 Long-term debt consisted of the following: (Dollars in thousands) April 2, 2022 April 3, 2021 Revolving credit facility maturing in 2026 $ — $ 26,900 Obligations under industrial revenue bonds due 2029 12,430 12,430 Total debt 12,430 39,330 Less current portion — — Total long-term debt $ 12,430 $ 39,330 On July 7, 2021, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with a syndicate of banks that provides for a revolving credit facility of up to $ 200.0 million, including a $ 45.0 million letter of credit sub-facility (“Amended Credit Agreement”). The Amended Credit Agreement replaced the Company’s previously existing $ 100.0 million revolving credit facility. Outstanding borrowings of $ 26.9 million on the Company’s previous revolving credit facility were repaid in July 2021. The Amended Credit Agreement allows the Company to draw down, repay and re-draw loans on the available funds during the term, subject to certain terms and conditions, matures in July 2026 and has no scheduled amortization. The Company capitalized $ 1.1 million of deferred financing fees associated with the Amended Credit Agreement, which is included in other noncurrent assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The Company wrote off $ 0.3 million of deferred financing fees associated with the previously existing credit facility, which is included in interest expense, net in fiscal 2022. The interest rate on borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement adjusts based on the consolidated total net leverage of the Company from a high of LIBOR plus 1.875 % and ABR plus 0.875 %, at the election of the Company, when the consolidated total net leverage ratio is equal to or greater than 2.25 :1.00, to a low of LIBOR plus 1.125 % and ABR plus 0.125 % when the consolidated total net leverage is below 0.50:1.00. In addition, the Company is obligated to pay an unused line fee ranging between 0.15 % and 0.3 % (depending on the consolidated total net leverage ratio) in respect of unused commitments under the Amended Credit Agreement. At April 2, 2022 the interest rate under the Credit Agreement was 1.6 % and letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement totaled $ 30.4 million . Total available borrowings under the Credit Agreement as of April 2, 2022 were $ 169.6 million. Obligations under industrial revenue bonds are supported by letters of credit and bear interest based on a municipal bond index rate. The weighted-average interest rate at both April 2, 2022 and April 3, 2021, including related costs and fees, was 2.18 %. The industrial revenue bonds require lump-sum payments of principal upon maturity in 2029 and are secured by the assets of certain manufacturing facilities. The Amended Credit Agreement contains covenants that restrict the amount of additional debt, liens and certain payments, including equity buybacks, investments, dispositions, mergers and consolidations, among other restrictions as defined. The Company was in compliance with all covenants of the Amended Credit Agreement as of April 2, 2022. Floor Plan Payable The Company’s retail operations utilize floor plan financing to fund the acquisition of manufactured homes for display or resale. At April 2, 2022 and April 3, 2021, the Company had outstanding borrowings on floor plan financing agreements of $ 35.5 million and $ 25.7 million, respectively. The financing arrangements allow for borrowings up to $ 67.0 million. Borrowings are secured by the F- 16 homes and are required to be repaid when the Company sells the home to a customer. The Company’s revenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of a contract are satisfied which generally occurs with the transfer of control of products. The Company enters into contracts with its customers to provide manufactured homes, modular homes, park model RVs, ADUs, commercial structures and transportation services. Generally, the Company’s contracts may be terminated by the Company’s customers at any time prior to initiation of construction of the respective home. Historically, terminations of these contracts have been minimal. The Company receives signed sales quotes from its customers, which provide the terms for a specific home, including price. The Company also has agreements with certain customers that provide for certain variable consideration, such as volume discounts, that are deducted from the contract price and accrued at the time of sale. In certain situations, the Company may receive payment in advance of completion of its contractual obligations. In these situations, the arising contract liability is classified within customer deposits and receipts in excess of revenues. Following the receipt of the customer deposit, the Company typically completes its performance obligation within a twelve-month period. For sales to independent retailers and builders/developers, revenue is recognized at the point in time when wholesale floor plan financing or retailer credit approval has been received, the home has shipped and title has transferred, which occurs when the Company has satisfied its contractual obligations and the control of its products has been transferred. The Company does not have an enforceable right to payment prior to shipment. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration that the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those products. The Company’s customers pay for products received in accordance with payment terms that are customary within the industry. As is customary in the factory-built housing industry, a significant portion of the Company’s sales to independent retailers are financed under floor plan financing programs with certain third-party lenders. Floor plan financing arrangements are generally identified prior to shipment of products and payment for sales financed under floor plan programs is generally received 5 to 10 business days from the date of invoice. For retail sales to consumers from Company-owned retail sales centers, revenue is recognized when the home has been delivered, set up and accepted by the consumer, and title has transferred. The Company recognizes commercial revenue and related cost of sales for long-term construction contracts (“Commercial”) over time as performance obligations are satisfied using the percentage-of-completion method (input method). Management estimates the stage of completion on each construction project based on progress and costs incurred. Unbilled revenue on long-term construction contracts are classified as a contract asset in accounts receivable. Receipts in excess of billings are classified as contract liabilities and included in other current liabilities. At April 2, 2022 and April 3, 2021 , uncollected billings related to long-term construction contracts totaled $ 1.4 million and $ 5.5 million, respectively. There was no unbilled revenue for long-term contracts at April 2, 2022 and April 3, 2021. Revenue for the Company’s transportation operations is recognized when a shipment has been delivered to its final destination. Amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling costs are included in net sales. Shipping and handling costs are accounted for as fulfillment costs and are included in cost of sales. F- 17 The following tables disaggregate the Company’s revenue by sales category: Year ended April 2, 2022 (Dollars in thousands) U.S. Factory-Built Housing Canadian Factory-built Housing Corporate/ Other Total Manufacturing and retail $ 1,980,794 $ 159,124 $ — $ 2,139,918 Commercial 10,272 — — 10,272 Transportation — — 57,039 57,039 Total $ 1,991,066 $ 159,124 $ 57,039 $ 2,207,229 Year ended April 3, 2021 (Dollars in thousands) U.S. Factory-Built Housing Canadian Factory-built Housing Corporate/ Other Total Manufacturing and retail $ 1,254,505 $ 101,328 $ — $ 1,355,833 Commercial 11,803 — — 11,803 Transportation — — 53,245 53,245 Total $ 1,266,308 $ 101,328 $ 53,245 $ 1,420,881 Year ended March 28, 2020 (Dollars in thousands) U.S. Factory-Built Housing Canadian Factory-built Housing Corporate/ Other Total Manufacturing and retail $ 1,218,293 $ 84,196 $ — $ 1,302,489 Commercial 8,100 — — 8,100 Transportation — — 59,141 59,141 Total $ 1,226,393 $ 84,196 $ 59,141 $ 1,369,730 The Company has operating leases for land, manufacturing and office facilities, and equipment. The Company’s lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such option. The Company's leases do not contain material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease terms.

The FASB Staff Q&A, Topic 740 No. 5, Accounting for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income , states that an entity can make an accounting election to either recognize deferred taxes for temporary differences expected to reverse as GILTI in future years or provide for the tax expense related to GILTI in the year the tax is incurred. The Company has elected to recognize the tax on GILTI as a period expense in the period the tax is incurred. The U.S. income tax rate for fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020 was 21 %. F- 20 Deferred tax assets and liabilities at April 2, 2022 and April 3, 2021 consisted of the following: (Dollars in thousands) April 2, 2022 April 3, 2021 ASSETS Employee compensation $ 12,042 $ 7,500 Intangible assets 9,833 10,665 Warranty reserves 8,043 7,041 Foreign net operating loss carryforwards 6,470 6,250 Self-insurance reserves 5,396 4,058 Lease assets 2,774 2,879 Equity-based compensation 2,206 1,333 Dealer volume discounts 2,077 1,631 State net operating loss carryforwards 2,023 2,372 U.S. tax credit carryforwards 1,891 2,030 Inventory reserves and impairments 1,750 1,558 Capitalized transaction costs 299 377 Foreign capital loss carryforwards 188 187 U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards - 4,583 Other 1,631 1,282 Gross deferred tax assets $ 56,623 $ 53,746 LIABILITIES Property, plant, and equipment 9,901 8,213 Intangible assets 7,834 9,470 Prepaid expenses 5,574 658 Foreign tax basis difference in investments 5,124 4,280 Lease liabilities 2,774 2,879 Other 49 60 Gross deferred tax liabilities $ 31,256 $ 25,560 Valuation allowance ( 12,741 ) ( 12,552 ) Net deferred tax assets $ 12,626 $ 15,634 The Company anticipates periodically repatriating the earnings of its Netherlands and Canadian subsidiaries. A deferred tax liability is recognized for income tax withholding which may be incurred upon the reversal of basis differences in investments in its foreign subsidiaries. The Company periodically evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets based on whether it is “more likely than not” that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Our evaluation considers available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit use of the existing deferred tax assets. The Company’s valuation allowance principally consists of valuation allowances for certain state NOL carryforwards, certain Canadian deferred tax assets, and the Company’s deferred tax assets in the Netherlands. As of April 2, 2022 , the Company has state NOL carryforwards in various jurisdictions which expire primarily in 2022 through 2042 . Unrecognized tax benefits represent the differences between tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return and the benefits recognized for financial statement purposes. There were no unrecognized tax benefits at April 2, 2022 and April 3, 2021. The Company classifies interest and penalties on income tax uncertainties as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and penalties as of April 2, 2022 and April 3, 2021, were not significant. The Company estimates no material changes to uncertain tax benefits in the next twelve months. The Company is no longer subject to foreign tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to fiscal 2018. The Company’s U.S. subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal tax examinations for fiscal 2019 through fiscal 2022 , and U.S. state tax examinations by tax authorities for fiscal 2018 through fiscal 2022. F- 21 The Company has equity incentive plans under which the Company has been authorized to grant share-based awards to key employees and non-employee directors. Equity-based compensation expense of $ 9.8 million, $ 6.0 million, and $ 8.3 million was recognized in fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Equity-based compensation expense is included in SG&A expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. The total associated income tax benefit recognized was $ 2.8 million , $ 1.0 million, and $ 1.3 million in fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020 respectively. Total unrecognized equity-based compensation for all share-based payment plan s was $ 16.8 million at April 2, 2022 , of which $ 8.7 million is expected to be recognized in fiscal 2023, $ 5.2 million in fiscal 2024 and $ 2.9 million thereafter, or a weighted-average period of 1.65 ye ars. Time-Vesting and Performance-Vesting Restricted Share Awards The Company granted awards to its officers, management employees, and certain members of the Board of Managers under an equity-classified management incentive plan (the “MIP”). In accordance with the provisions of the MIP, as modified on June 1, 2018, unvested units granted under the MIP were exchanged for unregistered, time-vesting restricted shares and performance-vesting restricted shares of the Company subject to stock restriction agreements (the “SRAs”). The exchange was accounted for as a modification. The fair value of the awards that vested during fiscal both 2021 and 2020 was $ 4.2 million. A summary of the activity associated with these awards is as follows: (amounts in thousands) Time Based Restricted Share Awards Outstanding at March 30, 2019 290 Vested ( 145 ) Outstanding at March 28, 2020 145 Vested ( 145 ) Outstanding at April 3, 2021 — Vested — Outstanding at April 2, 2022 — On September 26, 2018, the Company’s shareholders approved the Company’s 2018 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Equity Plan”) which provides for grants of options, stock appreciation rights, restricted and unrestricted stock and stock units, performance awards, and other awards convertible into or otherwise based on shares of the Company’s common stock. General terms and methods of valuation for the Company’s share-based awards granted under the Equity Plan are described below. F- 22 Stock Options Stock options generally have terms of 10 years, with one-third of each grant vesting each year for three years , and are assigned an exercise price that is equal to or greater than the closing market price of a share of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. When determining expected volatility, the Company considered volatility of guideline public companies. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant, based on the options’ expected term. The expected term of the options is based on the time period to exercise for each vesting tranche, which is calculated based on the average of: (i) the full option contractual term; and (ii) the starting vest date. A summary of the activity associated with these awards is as follows: Shares (in thousands) Weighted Average Exercise Price Per Share Weighted Average Remaining Term (in years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value (in thousands) Outstanding at March 30, 2019 146 $ 15.00 Granted 266 $ 32.11 Exercised ( 8 ) $ 15.00 Forfeitures ( 1 ) $ 15.00 Outstanding at March 28, 2020 403 $ 26.29 Granted 138 $ 31.21 Exercised ( 5 ) $ 15.00 Outstanding at April 3, 2021 536 $ 27.51 Granted 13 $ 53.06 Exercised ( 61 ) $ 25.04 Forfeitures ( 1 ) $ 31.68 Outstanding at April 2, 2022 487 $ 28.50 7.8 $ 13,169 Vested and expected to vest at April 2, 2022 487 $ 28.50 7.8 $ 13,169 Exercisable at April 2, 2022 297 $ 25.61 7.5 $ 8,900 The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model along with the weighted average grant date fair value for awards granted in the periods presented are as follows: Option Award Assumptions Fiscal 2022 Fiscal 2021 Fiscal 2020 Weighted-average assumptions used: Expected volatility 50.0 % 45.0 % 30.0 % Dividend yield — — — Risk-free interest rate 1.0 % 0.5 % 1.7 % Expected term, in years 6.00 6.00 5.88 Weighted average grant date fair value per share $ 25.29 $ 12.48 $ 10.33 Performance Share Units In fiscal 2022 , the Company issued performance share units that contain market vesting conditions, performance vesting conditions, and service conditions. The performance condition is based on the Company's market share of single family home completions (""SFC Market Share""). The SFC Market Share component of the awards are valued at the market price of a share of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. The market condition is based on the Company’s total shareholder return (“TSR”) compared to the median TSR of certain companies over a three year performance period. The Company used a Monte-Carlo simulation to determine the grant date fair value for the awards, which takes into consideration the possible outcomes pertaining to the TSR market condition. Per the terms of the awards, 0 % to 200 % of the Company’s performance share units vest on the third anniversary of the vesting commencement date based upon achievement of the performance and market conditions as specified in the performance share unit agreement. In fiscal 2021 and 2020 , the Company issued performance share units that contain market vesting conditions and service conditions. The market condition is based on the Company’s TSR compared to the median TSR of certain companies over a three year performance period. The Company used a Monte-Carlo simulation to determine the grant date fair value for the awards. Per the terms of the awards, 0 % to 150 % of the Company’s performance share units vest on the third anniversary of F- 23 the vesting commencement date based upon achievement of the market condition as specified in the performance share unit agreement. A summary of the activity associated with these awards is as follows: Shares (in thousands) Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Per Unit Outstanding at March 30, 2019 146 $ 3.62 Granted 86 $ 29.05 Forfeitures ( 2 ) $ 3.62 Outstanding at March 28, 2020 230 $ 13.85 Granted 61 $ 28.38 Outstanding at April 3, 2021 291 $ 16.90 Granted 96 $ 83.04 Vested ( 84 ) $ 6.38 Forfeitures ( 61 ) $ 6.57 Outstanding at April 2, 2022 242 $ 49.27 The assumptions used in the Monte-Carlo simulation for the performance condition of performance share units along with the weighted-average grant date fair value for awards granted in the periods presented are as follows: Performance Unit Assumptions Fiscal 2022 Fiscal 2021 Fiscal 2020 Weighted-average assumptions used: Expected volatility 54.8 % 50.0 % 30.0 % Dividend yield — — — Risk-free interest rate 1.1 % 2.0 % 1.6 % Expected term, in years 2.98 3.00 2.84 Weighted average grant date fair value per share $ 83.04 $ 28.38 $ 29.05 Restricted Stock and Restricted Share Awards Restricted stock units and restricted share awards are valued at the market price of a share of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. In general, these awards have graded vesting conditions in which a portion of awards vest ratably in three equal installments on the anniversary of the vesting commencement date. The total fair value of restricted stock which vested was approximately $ 8.0 million, $ 2.5 million, and $ 2.1 million during fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The weighted average grant date fair value for restricted stock units granted in fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020 wa s $ 67.90 , $ 28.33 , and $ 31.34 , respectively.

Certain of the Company’s time-vesting and performance-vesting restricted share awards were considered participating securities prior to the completion of the vesting period. The vesting for these time-based shares occurred in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. Diluted earnings per common share is computed based on the more dilutive of: (i) the two-class method, assuming the participating securities are not exercised or converted; or (ii) the treasury stock method. During fiscal years 2021, and 2020, the two-class method was more dilutive. The two-class method was not applicable to the computation for fiscal 2022 as the time-vested restricted share awards were fully vested and no longer considered participating securities. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share: Year Ended (Dollars and shares in thousands, except per share data) April 2, 2022 April 3, 2021 March 28, 2020 Numerator: Net income $ 248,044 $ 84,899 $ 58,160 Undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities — ( 77 ) ( 170 ) Net income attributable to the Company's common shareholders $ 248,044 $ 84,822 $ 57,990 Denominator: Basic weighted average shares outstanding 56,816 56,648 56,516 Dilutive securities 490 325 246 Diluted weighted average shares outstanding 57,306 56,973 56,762 Basic net income per share: $ 4.37 $ 1.50 $ 1.03 Diluted net income per share: $ 4.33 $ 1.49 $ 1.02 Securities that could potentially dilute basic EPS in the future that were considered antidilutive in the periods presented are shown below: Type of security (in thousands) April 2, 2022 April 3, 2021 Options $ 253 $ 62 Restricted Share Units 86 81 Performance Share Units 151 182 Total dilutive securities $ 490 $ 325 The Company’s U.S. subsidiary sponsors a defined contribution savings plan covering most U.S. employees. Full-time employees covered by the plan are eligible to participate. Participating employees may contribute from 1 % to 25 % of their compensation to the plan, with the Company matching 50 % of the first 6 % of pay contributed. The Company match vests after three years of employment or immediately for employees age 50 and over. The Company recognized expense o f $ 4.2 million , $ 2.6 million , and $ 2.4 million related to this plan during fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Full-time employees of the Company’s subsidiaries in Canada are generally covered by employer-sponsored defined contribution plans that require employee contributions and employer matching contributions. The Company recognized expense of $ 0.7 million , $ 0.5 million , and $ 0.6 million in fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020 . Financial results for the Company's reportable segments have been prepared using a management approach, which is consistent with the basis and manner in which financial information is evaluated by the Company's chief operating decision maker in allocating resources and in assessing performance. The Company’s chief operating decision maker, the Chief Executive Officer, evaluates the performance of the Company’s segment primarily based on net sales, before elimination of inter-company shipments, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) and operating assets. The Company operates in two reportable segments: (i) U.S. Factory-built Housing, which includes manufacturing and retail housing operations and (ii) Canadian Factory-built Housing. Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation operations, corporate costs directly incurred for all segments and intersegment eliminations. Segments are generally determined by geography. F- 25 Segment data includes intersegment revenues and corporate office costs that are directly and exclusively incurred for each segment. Total assets for Corporate/Other primarily include cash and certain deferred tax items not specifically allocated to another segment. F- 26 Selected financial information by reportable segment was as follows: Year Ended (Dollars in thousands) April 2, 2022 April 3, 2021 March 28, 2020 Net sales: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 1,991,066 $ 1,266,308 $ 1,226,393 Canadian Factory-built Housing 159,124 101,328 84,196 Corporate/Other 57,039 53,245 59,141 Consolidated net sales $ 2,207,229 $ 1,420,881 $ 1,369,730 Operating income: U.S. Factory-built Housing EBITDA $ 360,978 $ 142,699 $ 131,339 Canadian Factory-built Housing EBITDA 31,692 19,564 9,272 Corporate/Other EBITDA ( 38,793 ) ( 29,911 ) ( 35,610 ) Other income ( 36 ) ( 5,889 ) — Depreciation ( 13,384 ) ( 12,087 ) ( 13,116 ) Amortization ( 7,552 ) ( 5,617 ) ( 5,430 ) Consolidated operating income $ 332,905 $ 108,759 $ 86,455 Depreciation: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 10,823 $ 9,620 $ 11,015 Canadian Factory-built Housing 1,111 860 1,073 Corporate/Other 1,450 1,607 1,028 Consolidated depreciation $ 13,384 $ 12,087 $ 13,116 Amortization of U.S. Factory-built Housing intangible assets: $ 7,552 $ 5,617 $ 5,430 Capital expenditures: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 29,133 $ 6,261 $ 11,753 Canadian Factory-built Housing 1,419 1,034 1,566 Corporate/Other 1,427 721 2,070 Consolidated capital expenditures $ 31,979 $ 8,016 $ 15,389 (Dollars in thousands) April 2, 2022 April 3, 2021 Total Assets: U.S. Factory-built Housing (1) $ 695,500 $ 578,897 Canadian Factory-built Housing (1) 107,459 87,224 Corporate/Other (1) 431,660 251,781 Consolidated total assets $ 1,234,619 $ 917,902 F- 27 Repurchase Contingencies and Guarantees The Company is contingently liable under terms of repurchase agreements with lending institutions that provide wholesale floor plan financing to retailers. These arrangements, which are customary in the manufactured housing industry, provide for the repurchase of products sold to retailers in the event of default by the retailer on their agreement to pay the financial institution. The risk of loss from these agreements is significantly reduced by the potential resale value of any products that are subject to repurchase and is spread over numerous retailers. The repurchase price is generally determined by the original sales price of the product less contractually defined curtailment payments. Based on these repurchase agreements and our historical loss experience, we establish an associated loss reserve which was $ 2.3 million and $ 1.4 million at April 2, 2022 and April 3, 2021, respectively. Excluding the resale value of the homes, the contingent repurchase obligation as of April 2, 2022 was estimated to be approximately $ 339.5 million . Losses incurred on homes repurchased were immaterial during each of the fiscal years ended April 2, 2022, April 3, 2021, and March 28, 2020. At April 2, 2022, the Company was contingently obligated for approximately $ 30.4 million under letters of credit, primarily consisting of $ 12.6 million to support long-term debt, $ 17.5 million to support the casualty insurance program, and $ 0.3 million to support bonding agreements. The letters of credit are issued under a sub-facility of the Credit Agreement. The Company was also contingently obligated for $ 35.6 million under surety bonds, which generally support performance on long-term construction contracts and license and service bonding requirements. In the normal course of business, the Company’s former subsidiaries that operated in the United Kingdom historically provided certain guarantees to two customers. Those guarantees provide contractual liability for proven construction defects up to 12 years from the date of delivery of certain products. The guarantees remain a contingent liability of the Company which declines over time through October 2027. As of the date of this report, the Company expects few, if any, claims to be reported under the terms of the guarantees. Legal Proceedings The Company has agreed to indemnify counterparties in the ordinary course of its business in agreements to acquire and sell business assets and in financing arrangements. The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of its business. As of the date of this filing, the Company believes the ultimate liability with respect to these contingent obligations will not have, either individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Concentrations The components and products used in the factory-built housing operations are presently available from a variety of vendors, and the Company is not dependent upon any single supplier. Prices of certain materials, such as lumber, insulation, steel and drywall, can fluctuate significantly due to changes in demand and supply. Additionally, availability of certain materials, such as drywall and insulation, has sometimes been limited, resulting in higher prices and/or the need to find alternative suppliers. The Company generally has been able to pass higher material costs on to its customers in the form of surcharges and price increases. For fiscal 2022 and 2021 , sales from the Company’s Canadian operations were approximately 7 % of consolidated sales. For fiscal 2020, sales from the Company's Canadian operations were approximately 6 % of consolidated sales. The Company’s net assets in Canada totaled approximately $ 107.5 million and $ 87.2 million at April 2, 2022 and April 3, 2021, respectively. The Company has approximately 8,400 employees. The Company’s manufacturing facilities in Canada employ approximately 1,000 workers, and most of the workers belong to trade associations that operate under collective bargaining agreements. There are five collective bargaining agreements (one for each Canadian manufacturing facility) and each have separate expiration dates. The agreements are set to expire at various dates between June 2022 and June 2024. F- 28 On May 16, 2022, the company acquired certain operating assets of Manis Customer Builders, Inc. and related companies (""Manis"") for approximately $ 10.0 m illion. The acquisition of Manis will allow the Company to expand its manufacturing footprint and further streamline its product offering in the Southeast U.S. The initial accounting for the business combination is in process at the time of this filing due to the limited amount of time since the acquisition date.

BUSINESS General Skyline Champion Corporation, an Indiana corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries are referred to herein as "" Skyline Champion,"" ""us,"" ""we,"" ""our,"" the ""Company,"" and any other similar terms, unless otherwise indicated in this Annual Report. We are the largest independent publicly traded factory-built housing company in North America with net sales for the year ended April 3, 2021 (“fiscal 2021”) of approximately $1.4 billion. We have more than 70 years of homebuilding experience, approximately 7,700 employees and 40 manufacturing facilities located in 19 states across the United States and three provinces in western Canada. We offer a leading portfolio of manufactured and modular homes, park model RVs, accessory dwelling units (“ADUs”) and modular buildings for the multi-family, hospitality, senior and workforce housing sectors. Our facilities are strategically located to serve strong markets in the United States and western Canada. We operated 12 manufacturing facilities in the top ten states with the highest number of manufactured homes shipped in fiscal 2021, as well as 17 manufacturing facilities in the ten states with the greatest growth in the number of manufactured homes shipped in the last ten years. We believe that we maintained the following leading positions in the factory-built housing industry in the United States and western Canada (based on units) in calendar year 2020: • Number two position in the manufactured housing market segment in the United States • Number one modular builder in the United States • A leading position in western Canada • A leading position in park model RV sales We believe our market leading positions are driven by our comprehensive product offering, strong brand reputation, broad manufacturing footprint, and our complementary retail and logistics businesses. Our market share in the United States manufactured housing market segment has increased from approximately 8% in the beginning of fiscal 2011 to approximately 17% in fiscal 2021 based on total number of units produced. In the broader housing market, our market share is approximately 2%. We design and build a range of manufactured and modular homes, park model RVs, ADUs, and commercial structures. We believe that the high quality and broad scope of our product and service offerings provide us a competitive advantage relative to other factory-built and certain site-built homes. With our award-winning product designs, we seek to meet the needs of our localized customers, while also providing them with an array of pre-designed options. Our leading brands are marketed and distributed through a network of independent and company-owned retailers, community operators, government agencies, and commercial developers. We build homes under some of the most well-known brand names in the factory-built housing industry including Skyline Homes, Champion Home Builders, Genesis Homes, Athens Park Models, Dutch Housing, Excel Homes, Homes of Merit, New Era, Redman Homes, ScotBilt Homes, Shore Park, Silvercrest, and Titan Homes in the U.S., and Moduline and SRI Homes in western Canada. In addition to our core home building business, we operate a factory-direct manufactured home retail business, Titan Factory Direct, with 18 sales centers spanning the southern United States, and Star Fleet Trucking, which provides transportation services to the manufactured housing and other industries from several dispatch locations across the United States. Corporate Information On June 1, 2018, Skyline Champion Corporation (formerly known as Skyline Corporation), and Champion Enterprises Holdings, LLC (“Champion Holdings”) combined their operations pursuant to the Share Contribution & Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”), dated as of January 5, 2018, by and between Skyline Corporation and Champion Holdings. Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, Champion Holdings contributed to Skyline Corporation all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Champion Holdings’ wholly owned operating subsidiaries, Champion Home Builders, Inc. (“CHB”), and CHB International B.V. (“CIBV”) (the shares of stock of CHB and CIBV contributed to Skyline Corporation, the “Contributed Shares”), and in exchange for the Contributed Shares, Skyline Corporation issued to the members of Champion Holdings, in the aggregate, 47,752,008 shares of Skyline Corporation common stock, $0.0277 par value per share (such issuance, the “Shares Issuance”). The contribution of the Contributed Shares by Champion Holdings to the Corporation, and the Shares Issuance by Skyline Corporation to the members of Champion Holdings are collectively referred to herein as the “Exchange.” The Exchange was treated as a purchase of the Company by Champion Holdings for accounting and financial reporting purposes. As a result, the financial results for all periods presented prior to the Exchange are comprised solely of the results of Champion Holdings. 3 Our principal executive offices are located at 755 West Big Beaver Road, Suite 1000, Troy, Michigan 48084 . Our website is located at www. skylinechampion .com. Our website and the information contained on our website is not incorporated by reference and is not a part of this Annual Report. We make available, as soon as reasonably practicable, on our website, all of the reports required to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Our SEC filings are also available to the public on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov . Business Strategy We will continue to pursue opportunities to grow our revenue and earnings by constructing quality-built, sustainable, and innovatively designed homes and other modular structures in an environmentally friendly, factory setting. In connection with executing this business strategy, we are focused on the following four initiatives: • Increasing the operating capacity and profitability of our existing facilities • Investing in our customers’ online digital experience • Implementing production automation and enterprise-wide digital technology • Continuing a balanced organic and acquisition-based growth strategy Increasing the Operating Capacity and Profitability of our Existing Facilities We are currently focused on a number of ongoing operational initiatives to further enhance our operating margins and increase production capacity including: • refining our product floor plan designs and options to offer “designed flexibility” to our customers; • executing on continuous improvement initiatives related to identified procurement, operational and labor cost saving opportunities as well as streamlining overlapping functions; enhancing the efficiency and sustainability of our products through value-adding material substitution; and • standardizing our manufacturing processes and employing metrics-driven accountability measures across all of our facilities. Investing in our Customers’ Online Digital Experience The Company continues to invest in the design and testing of enhanced digital offerings. We are in the process of creating an end-to-end platform where consumers can design, configure, price and order their homes online which we believe will ultimately drive revenue growth for Skyline Champion and our channel partners. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen tremendous online interest from consumers and believe use of a digital platform to customize and purchase homes will continue to grow. Implementing Production Automation and Enterprise-wide Digital Technology • We are researching and installing production automation technology to mitigate reliance on direct labor, reduce material waste, and improve the precision of our construction processes. • In conjunction with our enhanced digital offering for the customer experience, we are moving to an enterprise-wide, cloud based integrated platform. This enhanced technology will offer real-time analytics for improved decision making and will facilitate additional improvements in our manufacturing operations. Continuing a Balanced Organic and Acquisition-Based Growth Strategy 4 On February 28, 2021, we acquired ScotBilt Homes, LLC and related companies from SHI Group Holdings, Inc. (collectively, “ScotBilt”). In calendar 2020, ScotBilt shipped over 1,600 homes from its two manufacturing facilities in Georgia providing affordable housing throughout Alabama, Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas. ScotBilt employs approximately 400 employees in its two manufacturing facilities. We believe ScotBilt is an excellent fit for Skyline Champion given our compatible company cultures, and its strong presence in the attractive mid-south region which helps to balance our national distribution and complement our existing manufacturing footprint. The operations of ScotBilt are included in our financial results since the date of the acquisition. In January 2021, we closed on the purchase of two idled manufacturing facilities in North Carolina, one of the strongest growth states in the U.S. We anticipate beginning production at this campus in fiscal 2023. We have demonstrated our ability to broaden our manufacturing and retail presence through the successful execution of a balanced organic growth and acquisition-based strategy. As demand for affordable housing grows and the global economy returns to pre-pandemic volumes, we will continue to execute on this growth strategy. We believe our idle manufacturing plants provide us with the ability to grow with demand over the longer term. We also intend to explore opportunities to acquire value enhancing retail locations, manufacturing facilities, and factory-built housing competitors to supplement our organic growth initiatives. We have a proven track-record of executing and integrating acquisitions. Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) We demonstrate our commitment to ESG through company-wide and plant-specific programs and through our everyday business practices when providing high-quality, yet affordable homes to U.S. and Canadian homebuyers. Manufactured and modular homes cost up to fifty percent less per square foot than conventional site-built homes, expanding the opportunity for individuals to own a home despite an ever-growing housing affordability gap. Skyline Champion manages its operations to minimize resource consumption and environmental impacts. We continue to identify opportunities to reduce our environmental impact across our operations by reducing raw material waste, designing and constructing energy efficient homes, conserving our natural resources through recycling programs and reducing our carbon footprint by producing our homes in factories close to where our customers and employees live. Many of our U.S. manufacturing facilities are certified to produce Energy Star® energy efficient rated homes through a special EPA program for manufactured housing. Environmental sustainability is at the forefront of what we do every day. We construct manufactured homes in controlled environments. Our efficient construction process results in less energy usage and material waste compared to traditional site-built construction. In many of our plants, we have transitioned to LED lighting, and we recycle insulation material, lumber, metals, paper and many other products. In the course of executing our expansion plans, we have repurposed older buildings, both revitalizing the local community and preserving vacant land. This reduces the need for new building materials and extensive deployment of construction equipment, and thus reduces carbon emissions. On our journey, we have launched a program to participate in reforestation. With forestry products central to the construction of homes, we have initiated a program to plant one tree for every tree used in construction of our homes in fiscal 2022. Reforestation contributes to the environment by replenishing forests, reducing greenhouses gases, and protecting the watershed. As a nationwide provider of affordable housing, we have a social responsibility to not only the buyers of our homes, our retail and community customers and our employees, but also to the communities in which they live and work. Many of our manufacturing facilities participate in local programs to support programs such as Habitat for Humanity and other local charities as well as work-study programs with local community colleges and high schools. Skyline Champion is committed to good corporate governance. We strive to maintain strong governance practices that protect and enhance accountability for the benefit of Skyline Champion, its shareholders, customers, employees and other business stakeholders. We regularly review and refine our governance practices and policies to align with evolving issues. Skyline Champion’s Corporate Governance Guidelines, the charters of committees of our Board and our Code of Conduct can be found in the Governance Documents section under the Governance tab on our website at www.skylinechampion.com . Additional information on our Corporate Governance policies can be found in our Proxy Statement filed with the SEC. 5 Human Capital and Diversity The Skyline Champion team manages the business in accordance with the Company’s Core Operating Principles: • Build and develop exceptional teams • Create a safe work environment • Build strong relationships • Take pride in our craftsmanship • Act with integrity and respect • Be open and honest • Run the business like it is your own We appreciate each member of the Skyline Champion team and the unique skills and diversity of thought each provides to the overall success of the Company. We strive for an inclusive environment and reward individual contributions that foster innovative ideas for improving our products and workplace. We do not tolerate discrimination or harassment of any kind including but not limited to on the basis of gender identity, race, religion, age or disabilities. We are committed to the development of our employees. The Company follows standard onboarding and training protocols for our direct labor team members and also offers management and OSHA training for our supervisors. We are committed to improving employee engagement and reducing turnover through these onboarding, training and mentoring activities. Depending on availability, our plants participate in local outreach programs and hire disadvantaged members of the local community. We have built a diverse team with a wide range of experiences. At April 3, 2021, we employed approximately 7,700 full and part time employees. Our human capital resource objectives include identifying, recruiting, training, retaining and incentivizing our employees. We offer our employees a competitive compensation package, including an array of benefits and we deem our relationship with our employees to be generally good. At April 3, 2021, our manufacturing facilities in Canada employed approximately 900 workers of which the majority belong to trade associations that operate under collective bargaining agreements. There are five collective bargaining agreements (one for each Canadian manufacturing facility) and each have separate expiration dates. We are operating under an extension and continue to negotiate for one agreement that otherwise would have expired in November 2019. The remaining agreements are set to expire in May 2021, June 2021, June 2022, and November 2022. We are committed to conducting our business with integrity and in compliance with all applicable laws of the cities, states and countries in which we operate. We have adopted a written Code of Conduct and Ethics to assist employees in this regard. We encourage employees to report concerns through a variety of channels, including a compliance and ethics line which allows for anonymous reporting. All reports are investigated and resolved. We also maintain an anti-retaliation policy such that any employee who reports a concern in good faith is protected from harassment, retaliation or adverse employment consequences. We take the health and safety of our employees seriously. We expect each employee to follow our safety standards and protocols. We added an Environmental Health and Safety team member this year to benchmark and install best practices at our plants. Each of our locations performs regular safety audits to ensure that proper safety policies are in place and appropriate safety training is provided. In addition to training and development, we measure and report out on monthly safety metrics and regularly review our safety performance with our Board of Directors. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented standards to operate in accordance with social-distancing protocols and public health authority guidelines. In fiscal 2021 in response to the pandemic, the Company offered extended benefits to employees, including increased sick pay and waived premium payments on healthcare benefits for furloughed employees. Factory-Built Housing A majority of our manufactured products are constructed in accordance with the regulations and rules of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) and the National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974, as amended (""HUD code""). We produce a broad range of manufactured and modular homes under a variety of brand names and in a variety of floor plans and price ranges. While most of the homes we build are single-family, multi-section, ranch-style homes, we also build two-story, single-section, and Cape Cod style homes as well as multi-family units such as town homes, apartments, duplexes, and triplexes. The single-family homes that we manufacture generally range in size from 400 to 4,000 square feet and typically include two to four bedrooms, a living room or family room, a dining room, a kitchen and typically two full bathrooms. We also build park model RVs for resorts and campgrounds, ADUs for backyard or recreational living, and commercial modular structures, including apartments, hotels, assisted living, and student and workforce housing. 6 We regularly introduce homes with new floor plans, exterior designs and elevations, decors and features. Our corporate marketing and engineering departments work with our manufacturing facilities to design homes that appeal to consumers’ changing tastes at appropriate price points for their respective markets. We design and build homes with a traditional residential or site-built appearance through the use of , among other features, dormers and higher pitched roofs. In fiscal 2020, we introduced our Genesis brand of homes which have features similar to site-built home amenities such as porches and garages . These homes are designed to be eligible for financing programs with terms similar to traditional mortgages . We are also very active in the design and construction of energy-efficient homes. The components and products used in factory-built housing are generally of the same quality as those used by other home builders, including conventional site-builders. The primary components include lumber, plywood, OSB, drywall, steel, floor coverings, insulation, exterior siding (vinyl, composites, wood and metal), doors, windows, shingles, kitchen appliances, furnaces, plumbing and electrical fixtures and hardware. These components are presently available from a variety of sources and we are not dependent upon any single supplier. Prices of certain materials such as lumber, insulation, steel, and drywall can fluctuate significantly due to changes in demand and supply. Lumber and related products experienced significant cost increases in fiscal 2021, primarily as a result of COVID-19 related supply chain issues. Those issues have also impacted the availability of certain materials such as lumber, OSB, insulation and appliances. We mitigate the impact of supply chain challenges through sourcing alternative materials, where appropriate, and exploring alternative supply options. We generally have been able to pass higher material costs on to customers in the form of surcharges and price increases. Typically, a one to three-week supply of raw materials is maintained, however, during the second half of fiscal 2021, supply chain availability became more volatile causing our manufacturing operations to increase the amount of frequently used raw materials on hand versus what is typically carried. Most completed factory-built homes have cabinets, wall coverings and electrical, heating and plumbing systems. HUD code homes also generally contain factory installed floor coverings, appliances and window treatments. Optional factory installed features include fireplaces, dormers, entertainment centers and skylights. Upon completion of the home at the factory, homes sold to retailers are transported to a retail sales center or directly to the home site. Homes sold to builders and developers are generally transported directly to the home site. At the home site, the home is placed on a foundation or otherwise affixed to the property and readied for occupancy, typically by setup contractors. The sections (also referred to as floors) of a multi-section home are joined and the interior and exterior seams are finished at the home site. The consumer purchase of the home may also include retailer or contractor supplied items such as additional appliances, air conditioning, furniture, porches, decks, and garages. We construct homes in indoor facilities using an assembly-line process employing approximately 100 to 200 production employees at each facility. Factory-built HUD code homes are constructed in one or more sections affixed to a steel support frame that allows the sections to be moved through the assembly line and transported upon sale. The sections of many of the modular homes we produce are built on wooden floor systems and transported on carriers that are removed upon placement of the home at the home site. Each section or floor is assembled in stages, beginning with the construction of the frame and the floor, then adding the walls, ceiling and roof assembly, and other constructed and purchased components, and ending with a final quality control inspection. The efficiency of the assembly-line process, protection from the weather, and favorable pricing of materials resulting from our substantial purchasing power enables us to produce homes more quickly and often at a lower cost than a conventional site-built home of similar quality. The production schedules of our homebuilding facilities are based upon customer orders, which can fluctuate from week to week. Orders from retailers are generally subject to cancellation at any time up to the commencement of production without penalty and are not necessarily an indication of future business. Retailers place orders for retail stocking (inventory) purposes and for homebuyer orders. Before scheduling homes for production, orders and availability of financing are confirmed with our customer and, where applicable, their lender. Although current backlogs have on average lengthened the time to build and ship a home, orders are generally filled within 90 days of receipt. Because we produce homes to fulfill wholesale orders, our factories generally do not carry finished goods inventories, except for homes awaiting delivery. We manage our production levels, capacity and workforce size based upon current market demands. At April 3, 2021, we had a backlog of home orders with wholesale sales value of approximately $858.6 million. After production of a particular home has commenced, the order becomes noncancelable and the retailer is obligated to take delivery of the home. Although factory-built homes can be produced throughout the year in indoor facilities, demand for homes is usually affected by inclement weather and by the cold winter months in northern areas of the U.S. and in Canada. Charges to transport homes increase with the distance from the factory to the retailer or home site. As a result, most of the retailers and builders/developers we sell to are located within a 500-mile radius of our manufacturing plants. In addition to our traditional channels of distribution, we are one of a limited number of manufactured homebuilders who have been approved for contracts with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (“ FEMA”) and have historically provided housing assistance requirements following natural disasters and other housing emergencies. We offer a wide selection of manufactured and modular homes as well as park model RVs at company-owned retail locations marketed under the Titan Factory Direct brand. We maintain our company-owned retail presence through 18 retail sales centers in 7 Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, North Carolina, Oklahoma, and Texas. O ur captive retail distribution enhance s the reach of our factory-built housing products directly to the homebuyer. Each of our full-service retail sales centers has a sales office and a variety of model homes of various sizes, floor plans, features, and prices that are displayed in a residential setting with sidewalks and landscaping. Customers may purchase a home from an inventory of homes maintained at the location, including a model home, or may order a home that will be built at a manufacturing facility. The collective benefits of our retail organization provide industry leadership with the expertise to be proactive to local economic conditions and ultimately provide affordable homes to value-conscious homebuyers. During fiscal 2021, the average selling price was $63,400 for our U.S. factory-built homes and $82,300 for our homes sold through our Canadian housing segment. Manufactured home sales prices ranged from $20,000 to over $250,000. Retail sales prices of the homes, without land, generally ranged from $25,000 to over $300,000, depending upon size, floor plan, features, and options. Logistics We operate a logistics business, Star Fleet Trucking, specializing in the transportation of manufactured homes and recreational vehicles from manufacturing facilities to retailers. Star Fleet’s delivery logistics are coordinated through dispatch terminals located throughout the U.S. Star Fleet has strong relationships with its customer base, which includes some of the largest manufactured housing companies (including our own factory-built housing operations), and recreational vehicle manufacturers in the U.S. Market Overview General. Since July 2020, U.S. and Canadian housing demand has been robust. The limited availability of existing homes for sale and the broader need for newly built affordable, single-family housing has continued to drive demand for new homes in these markets. Factory-built housing provides an affordable alternative to other types of housing such as site-built housing and condominiums, and to existing housing such as pre-owned homes and apartments. According to statistics published by the Institute for Building Technology and Safety (""IBTS"") and the United States Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, for the 2020 calendar year, manufactured housing wholesale shipments of homes constructed in accordance with the HUD code accounted for an estimated 10% of all new single-family homes starts. According to data reported by the Manufactured Housing Institute (“MHI”), industry manufactured home shipments were 95,588, 97,553 and 93,377 units during fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Annual shipments have generally increased each year since calendar year 2009 when only 50,000 HUD-coded manufactured homes were shipped, the lowest level since the industry began recording statistics in 1959. While shipments of HUD-coded manufactured homes have improved modestly in recent years, manufactured housing’s most recent annual shipment levels still operate at lower levels than the long-term historical average of over 200,000 units annually. The market for factory-built housing is affected by a number of factors, including the availability, cost and credit underwriting standards of consumer financing, consumer confidence, employment levels, general housing market, interest rates and other economic conditions and the overall affordability of factory-built housing versus other forms of housing. In the past, a number of factors have restricted demand for factory-built housing, including, in some cases, less-favorable financing terms compared to site-built housing, the effects of restrictive zoning on the availability of certain locations for home placement and, in some cases, an unfavorable public image. Certain of these adverse factors have lessened considerably in recent years with the improved quality and appearance of factory-built housing. Home Buyer Demographics. We believe the segment of the housing market in which manufactured housing is most competitive includes consumers with household incomes under $60,000. This segment has a high representation of young single persons and married couples, first time home buyers, and homebuyers age 55 and older. The comparatively low cost of manufactured homes is attractive to these consumers. People in rural areas, where fewer housing alternatives exist, and those who presently live in factory-built homes, also make up a significant portion of the demand for new factory-built housing. We believe higher-priced, multi-section manufactured and modular homes are attractive to households with higher incomes as an alternative to rental housing and condominiums and are well suited to meet the needs of the retiree buyer in many markets. The two largest manufactured housing consumer demographics, Millennials (generally defined as those born between 1981 – 1996) and Baby Boomers (generally defined as those born between 1946 – 1964), comprise the fastest growing populations. Millennials are generally first-time home buyers who may be attracted by the affordability and diversity of style choices of factory-built homes. Baby Boomers are similarly interested in the value proposition; however, they are also motivated by the energy efficiency and low maintenance requirements of factory-built homes, and by the lifestyle offered by planned communities that are specifically designed for homeowners that fall into this age group. More recently, we have seen a number of market trends pointing to increased sales of ADUs and urban-to-rural migration as customers accommodate working from home patterns as well as people seeking rent-to-own single-family options. 8 In addition, if financing availability continues to improve and related regulation continues to ease, we believe that there will be an increase in the number of prospective customers who qualify for home loans for manufactured and modular homes. Financing Commercial Financing. Independent retailers of factory-built homes generally finance their inventory purchases from manufacturers with floor plan financing provided by third-party lending institutions and secured by a lien on the homes. The availability and cost of floor plan financing can affect the amount of retailer new home inventory, the number of retail sales centers and related wholesale demand. Under a typical floor plan financing arrangement, an independent financial institution specializing in this line of business provides the retailer with a loan for the purchase price of the home and maintains a security interest in the home as collateral. The financial institution customarily requires us, as the manufacturer of the home, to enter into a separate repurchase agreement with the financial institution that, upon default by the retailer and under certain other circumstances, obligates us to repurchase the financed home at declining prices over the term of the repurchase agreement (which, in most cases, is 18 to 36 months). The price at which we may be obligated to repurchase a home under these agreements is based upon the amount financed, plus certain administrative and shipping expenses. Our obligation under these repurchase agreements ceases upon the purchase of the home by the retail customer. The maximum amount of our contingent obligations under such repurchase agreements was approximately $219.5 million as of April 3, 2021. The risk of loss under these agreements is spread over many retailers and is further reduced by the resale value of the homes. During fiscal 2021, approximately 36% of our sales to independent retailers were financed under floor plan agreements with national lenders, while the remaining 64% were financed under various arrangements with local or regional banks or paid in cash. We generally receive payment from the lending institution 5 to 10 days after a home is sold and invoiced. Consumer Financing. Sales of factory-built homes are significantly affected by the availability, credit underwriting standards, and cost of consumer financing. There are three basic types of consumer financing in the factory-built housing industry: 1) conforming mortgage loans which comply with the requirements of the Federal Housing Administration (“FHA”), Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Agriculture or Government-Sponsored Enterprise (“GSE”) loans which include Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac agencies; 2) non-conforming mortgages for purchasers of the home and the land on which the home is placed; and 3) personal property loans (often referred to as home-only or chattel loans) for consumers where the home is the sole collateral for the loan (generally HUD-coded homes). Industry trade associations are working towards favorable legislative and GSE action to address the mortgage financing needs of potential buyers of affordable homes. Many moderate-income families cannot afford to buy a home due to the increasing costs of newly constructed homes and decreasing supply of existing, affordable homes. Federal law required the GSEs to issue a regulation to implement the Duty to Serve (“DTS”) requirements specified in the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992, as amended by the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008. FNMA and FHLMC released their final Underserved Markets Plan that describes, with specificity, the actions they will take over a three-year period to fulfill the DTS obligation. These plans became effective on January 1, 2018. The GSEs have obtained feedback from various stakeholders during their outreach efforts on advancing the underserved markets since the DTS plans became effective in 2018. Their DTS plans continue to evolve based on the feedback received and their current areas of focus are as follows: 1) purchase more loans used to finance manufactured homes titled as real property; 2) enhance current products and create new offerings; and 3) provide consumer education to help borrowers navigate both the real property and personal property markets. In 2020, the GSEs rolled out financing programs specifically for homes built to the HUD code, which include CHOICEHome® from Freddie Mac and MH Advantage® from Fannie Mae. HUD-coded homes manufactured for these programs have features comparable to site-built homes, including, drywall throughout, higher-pitch roof line, energy-efficient features, lower profile foundation, plus additional options such as a garage or carport. These products aim to promote quality manufactured homes as an acceptable alternative to site-built homes and will allow moderate-income families to purchase a manufactured home with lending terms similar to those for site-built homes. Our Genesis brand of homes are built to these specifications. We continue to work with builder/developers to cultivate strategies to bring these products to the marketplace. The DTS plans also explored the potential for the GSEs to provide liquidity to the chattel lending market, first through a limited pilot and then through an ongoing program. The GSEs could potentially serve as additional sources of funding as there is unmet demand in the chattel loan industry, and GSE involvement could increase volume substantially. Freddie Mac has made the decision to suspend activities on pursuing a pilot on manufactured homes titled as personal property and instead allocate resources on pursuing activities including loan purchases of manufactured homes titled as real property. The Fannie Mae DTS plan still includes a provision indicating that they are exploring a pilot to establish a secondary market for chattel or home-only loans. Expansion of the secondary market for home-only lending through the GSEs could provide further demand for housing, as lending options would likely become more available to home buyers. Separate from the GSE involvement in chattel markets, there have been four secondary market chattel private placement offerings over the last two years. Although some limited progress has been made in this area, a meaningful positive impact in the form of increased home orders has yet to be realized. 9 Competition The housing industry is highly competitive based upon several factors, including price, product features, reputation for service and quality, depth of distribution or location, and financing. Capital requirements for entry into the industry are relatively low. Factory-built housing is also very competitive. According to MHI, in March 2021, there were 33 producers of manufactured homes in the U.S. operating an estimated 136 production facilities. For calendar 2020, the top three companies had a combined market share for HUD code homes of approximately 75%. We estimate that there were approximately 3,200 industry retail locations throughout the U.S. during calendar 2020. Based on industry data reported by IBTS, in fiscal 2021 our U.S. wholesale market share of HUD code homes sold was 16.9%, compared to 16.5% in fiscal 2020. We compete with the other producers of manufactured homes, as well as companies selling homes repossessed from wholesalers or consumers. In addition, manufactured homes compete with new and existing site-built homes, as well as apartments, townhouses, and condominiums. There are a number of other national manufacturers competing for a significant share of the manufactured housing market in the U.S., including Clayton Homes and Cavco Industries. Certain of these competitors may possess greater financial, manufacturing, distribution, and marketing resources. Government Regulation Our manufactured homes are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws, codes and regulations. The majority of our homes are built to comply with the HUD code which includes regulations that cover all aspects of manufactured home construction and installation, including structural integrity, fire safety, wind loads, thermal protection and ventilation. To the extent state and local regulations conflict with the HUD code, they are pre-empted. Our modular homes and commercial structures are built to comply with applicable state and local building codes. Our park model RVs are built in conformance with the applicable standards approved by the American National Standards Institute, a private, non-profit organization that administers and coordinates voluntary standards and conformity programs. A variety of laws affect the financing of the homes we manufacture. The Federal Consumer Credit Protection Act and Regulation Z promulgated thereunder require written disclosure of information relating to such financing, including the amount of the annual percentage interest rate and the finance charge. A variety of state laws also regulate the form of financing documents and the allowable deposits, finance charge and fees charged. Federal laws permit manufactured housing retailers to assist home buyers with securing financing for the purchase of homes; however, they are prohibited from negotiating the financing terms. Governmental authorities enforcing these numerous laws and regulations can impose fines and/or seek injunctive relief for violations. We believe that our operations are in compliance with the requirements of these applicable laws and regulations. Seasonality The housing industry is subject to seasonal fluctuations based on home buyer purchasing patterns. We typically experience decreased home buyer traffic during holidays and popular vacation periods. Demand for our core single-family new home products typically peaks each spring and summer before declining in the winter, consistent with the overall housing industry. Typical seasonal patterns were not as prevalent in fiscal 2021 since demand for housing has increased significantly. We expect seasonal patterns to return once demand returns to more typical levels. The U.S. has experienced extreme weather events over the past few years resulting in widespread property damage. It has been widely reported that the overall economic toll in the affected market areas that have experienced severe weather events is substantial. There has been somewhat increased consumer demand for replacement of homes lost as a result of these events. This may include demand for additional disaster-relief manufactured home orders from federal and state agencies. We have produced disaster-relief homes for FEMA previously. These homes were built in factories located in unaffected regions of the country, primarily during the winter months, which lessened disruptions to existing order demand from our core customer base. Available Information Our website address is www.skylinechampion.com and we make available, free of charge, on or through our website all of our periodic reports, including our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K, as soon as reasonably practicable after we file such reports with the SEC. 10 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Our business involves a number of risks and uncertainties. You should carefully consider the following risks, together with the information provided elsewhere in this Annual Report. The items described below are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks that are currently unknown to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial may also impair our business or adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. COVID-19 Pandemic Risks The COVID-19 pandemic has materially and adversely impacted and disrupted our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and business and we expect it could continue to do so. The global outbreak of COVID-19 has caused a material adverse effect on the level of economic activity around the world, including in all of the markets that we serve. We have implemented numerous measures attempting to manage and mitigate the effects of the virus on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and business, but there can be no assurance that these measures will succeed. We cannot predict the degree to which, or the time period over which, our sales and operations will be affected by this outbreak. The effects could be material. The COVID-19 pandemic poses many risks including the following, among others: • Our employees, suppliers, customers and others may be restricted or prevented from conducting business activities for indefinite or intermittent periods of time, including as a result of employee health and safety concerns, shutdowns, shelter-in-place or stay-at-home orders, travel restrictions, and other actions and restrictions that may be requested or mandated by governmental authorities. • Due to social distancing protocols and higher than normal employee absenteeism caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the capacity output of our manufacturing facilities has decreased when compared to pre-COVID-19 levels. Lower capacity utilization of our facilities could continue to persist until the effects of the pandemic subside. • We have experienced, and may continue to experience, disruptions and delays in our supply chain as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This has resulted in and is likely to continue to result in higher supply chain costs to us, in order to maintain the supply of component parts needed to produce our products. • Our management of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic has required, and will continue to require, significant investment of time by our management and employees. The focus on managing and mitigating the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business may cause us to divert or delay the application of our resources toward other initiatives or investments, which in turn may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. • We may experience impacts from market downturns and changes in consumer behavior including uncertainty in consumer confidence, increasing unemployment, and reductions in discretionary spending related to pandemic fears as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic include widespread unemployment and uncertainty, among other problems, reducing the likelihood of people seeking new or improved housing. • The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have caused uncertainty and volatility in the credit markets. We rely on the credit markets to provide us with liquidity to operate and grow our business beyond the liquidity that operating cash flows provide. If our access to capital were to become significantly constrained, or if costs of capital were to increase significantly due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, then our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and business, could be materially adversely affected. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact us will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new government actions or restrictions, new information that may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19, the longevity of COVID-19, the availability and efficacy of vaccines and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on economic activity. The COVID-19 pandemic also may have the effect of significantly heightening other risks associated with our business and our financial condition, including several of the risks disclosed below. Market, Industry and Supply Chain Risks Raw material shortages and price increases could delay or increase the cost of construction of our products which could materially and adversely impact our results of operations and our cash flows. Certain materials used in the construction of homes such as lumber, insulation, steel, drywall, oil-based products and fuel, among others, can become scarce during periods of high demand for new home construction as well as renovation and remodeling of existing homes. We depend on timely and sufficient delivery of raw materials from our suppliers. In addition, a few key components of our products are produced by a small group of quality suppliers that have the capacity to supply large quantities. Disruption to the supply chain of these key components could have an adverse impact on our production output. Raw material shortages from these and 11 other suppliers can be more severe during periods following natural disasters or broader economic disruptions such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, during fiscal 2021, we saw a significant increase in the cost, and decrease in the availability, of forest products as a result of increased demand and shutdowns of lumber mills due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It is uncertain whether these shortages will continue as is, improve or worsen. Pricing for raw materials can also be affected by the factors mentioned above as well as national, regional, local, economic and political factors, including tariffs. As a result, we may continue to see raw material cost pressures in future periods as strong housing demand continues. We may attempt to pass the higher material costs onto customers, but it is not certain that we will be able to achieve this without adversely affecting demand. Raw material shortages and price increases could cause delays in and increases to our costs of construction which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The factory-built housing industry is cyclical, is affected by seasonality and is sensitive to changes in general economic or other business conditions. The factory-built housing industry is affected by seasonality. Sales during the period from March to November are typically higher than in other months. As a result, our sales and operating results sometimes fluctuate and may continue to fluctuate in the future. The factory-built housing industry is also sensitive to changes in economic conditions and other factors, such as pandemics, employment rates, job growth, population growth, consumer confidence, consumer income, availability of financing, interest rate levels, and an oversupply of homes for sale. Changes in any of these conditions generally, or in the markets where we operate, could reduce demand and constrain pricing for new factory-built homes in these areas or result in customer cancellations of pending shipments. Reductions in the number of homes shipped by us or constraints on the prices we can charge, could result in a decrease in our net sales and earnings, which could adversely affect our financial condition. We are subject to demand fluctuations in the housing industry. Changes in demand could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Demand for our homes is subject to fluctuations in the housing market generally. In a housing market downturn, our sales and results of operations could be adversely affected; there might be significant inventory impairments and other write-offs; our gross margins could decline significantly from historical levels; and we might incur losses from operations. We cannot predict the future demand for housing. If it were to decline significantly, our financial condition could be adversely affected. Rapid or significantly increasing demand can also adversely affect our business. Longer periods of time between order acceptance and production introduce a risk that we may not be able to construct homes profitably if material and labor costs increase. Although we have generally been able to pass along price increases to our customers in periods of rising costs, we may not be able to in the future, or the price increases may cause consumers to explore other housing alternatives and/or exit the home buying process, negatively impacting demand for our homes. Factory-built housing operates in the highly competitive housing industry, and, if other home builders are more successful or offer better value to our customers, then our business could decline. We operate in a very competitive environment and face competition from a number of other home builders in each market in which we operate. We compete with large national and regional home building companies and with smaller local home builders for financing, raw materials, and skilled management and labor resources. Some of our manufacturing competitors have captive retail distribution systems and consumer finance and insurance operations. In addition, there are independent factory-built housing retail locations that sell competitors’ products in most areas where our homes are sold and in most areas where we have Company-owned retail operations. Because barriers to entry to the industry at both the manufacturing and retail levels are low, we believe that it is relatively easy for new competitors to enter our markets. In addition, our products compete within the housing industry more broadly with other forms of low to moderate-cost housing, including site-built homes, panelized homes, apartments, townhouses, condominiums, and repossessed homes. We also compete with resale homes, also referred to as “previously owned” or “existing” homes, as well as rental housing. An oversupply of homes available for sale or the heavy discounting of home prices by our competitors could adversely affect demand for our homes and the results of our operations. An increase in competitive conditions could have any of the following impacts on us: sale of fewer homes or higher cancellations by our home buyers; an increase in selling incentives or reduction of prices; and realization of lower gross margins due to lower selling prices or an inability to increase selling prices to offset increased costs of 12 the homes delivered. If we are unable to compete effectively in our markets, then our business could decline disproportionately to that of our competitors. As a result, our sales could decline and our results of operations and cash flows could suffer. Changes in consumer preferences for our products or our failure to gauge those preferences could lead to reduced sales. We cannot be certain that historical consumer preferences for factory-built homes in general, and for our products in particular, will remain unchanged. Our ability to remain competitive depends heavily on our ability to provide a continuing and timely introduction of innovative product offerings. We believe that the introduction of new features, designs, and models will be critical to the future success of our operations. Managing frequent product introductions poses inherent risks. Delays in the introduction or market acceptance of new models, designs, or product features could have a material adverse effect on our business. Products may not be accepted for a number of reasons, including changes in consumer preferences or our failure to properly gauge consumer preferences. Further, we cannot be certain that new product introductions will not reduce net sales from existing models and adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, our net sales may be adversely affected if our new models and products are not introduced to the market on time or are not successful when introduced. Finally, our competitors’ products may obtain better market acceptance despite our efforts to lead the market. Increases in the after-tax costs of owning a factory-built home could deter potential customers from buying our products and adversely affect our business or results of operations. Significant expenses of owning a factory-built home, including mortgage interest expenses and real estate taxes, generally were, under prior tax law, deductible expenses for an individual’s federal income taxes and, in some cases, state income taxes, subject to certain limitations. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, signed into law in December 2017 (the “Tax Act”), included provisions that impose limitations with respect to these income tax deductions. Increases in property tax rates or fees on developers by local governmental authorities, as experienced in response to reduced federal and state funding or to fund local initiatives, such as funding schools or road improvements, or increases in home insurance premiums, also can adversely affect the ability of potential customers to obtain financing or their desire to purchase new homes, and in turn can have adverse impacts on our business and results of operations. Natural disasters and severe weather conditions could delay deliveries, increase costs, and decrease demand for new factory-built homes in affected areas. Our operations are located in many areas that are subject to natural disasters and severe weather. The occurrence of natural disasters or severe weather conditions can delay factory-built home deliveries, increase costs by damaging inventories, reduce the availability of materials, and negatively impact the demand for new factory-built homes in affected areas. Furthermore, if our insurance does not fully cover business interruptions or losses resulting from these events, then our earnings, liquidity, or capital resources could be adversely affected. Increased attention to environmental, social and governance matters may impact our business, financial results or stock price. Recently, more attention has been directed to publicly traded companies and their activities related to environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) matters. Advocacy groups have campaigned for action to promote change at public companies related to ESG matters. These activities include increasing action related to climate change and the use of energy efficient building products. A failure, or perceived failure, to respond to investor or customer expectations related to ESG concerns could cause harm to our business and reputation. In addition, organizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and other matters have developed ratings systems for evaluating companies on their approach to ESG. Unfavorable ESG ratings may lead to negative investor sentiment which could have a negative impact on our stock price. Regulatory Risks Environmental laws and regulations relating to climate change and energy can have an adverse impact on our business, our results of operations and on the availability and price of certain raw materials. Government regulations proposed or enacted in response to climate change could result in increased costs of raw materials and other production costs of our homes. We believe that a variety of new legislation may be considered at the federal, state and local levels relating to climate change and energy efficiency. This legislation could result in changes to the HUD-code and other building standards requiring more robust energy efficiency standards or require the use of energy-saving construction material in our products. New building code requirements that impose stricter energy efficiency standards could significantly increase our costs. Compliance 13 with these new standards may also cause an increase in our costs and use of human capital resources. As climate change and energy efficiency remains a global focus, energy-related initiatives will impact many companies including our suppliers of many of our raw materials such as lumber and steel. The initiatives undertaken by our suppliers could adversely impact our results of operations to the extent our suppliers raise their prices to cover energy and climate related initiatives. New environmental laws and regulations could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations. If the factory-built housing industry is not able to secure favorable local zoning ordinances, our sales could decline and our results of operations and cash flows could suffer. Limitations on the number of sites available for placement of factory-built homes or on the operation of factory-built housing communities could reduce the demand for factory-built homes and, as a result, our sales. Factory-built housing communities and individual home placements are subject to local zoning ordinances and other local regulations relating to utility service and construction of roadways. In the past, some property owners have resisted the adoption of zoning ordinances permitting the use of factory-built homes in residential areas, which we believe has restricted the growth of the industry. Factory-built homes may not receive widespread acceptance and localities may not adopt zoning ordinances permitting the development of factory-built home communities. If the factory-built housing industry is unable to secure favorable local zoning ordinances, then our sales could decline and our results of operations and cash flows could suffer. We are subject to extensive regulation affecting the production and sale of factory-built housing, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We are subject to a variety of federal, state, and local laws and regulations affecting the production and sale of factory-built housing. Our failure to comply with such laws and regulations could expose us to a wide variety of sanctions, including closing one or more manufacturing facilities. Regulatory matters affecting our operations are under regular review by governmental bodies and we cannot predict what effect, if any, new laws and regulations would have on us or on the factory-built housing industry. Failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or the passage in the future of new and more stringent laws, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The transportation industry is subject to government regulation, and regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Our Star Fleet Trucking subsidiary provides transportation services. The transportation industry is subject to legislative or regulatory changes, including potential limits on carbon emissions under climate change legislation and Department of Transportation regulations regarding, among other things, driver breaks, classification of independent drivers, “restart” rules, and the use of electronic logging devices that can affect the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or influencing the demand for, and cost of providing, transportation services. We may become subject to new or more restrictive regulations relating to fuel emissions or limits on vehicle weight and size. Future laws and regulations may be more stringent and require changes in operating practices, influence the demand for transportation services or increase the cost of providing transportation services, any of which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Operational Risks Our results of operations can be adversely affected by labor shortages, turnover and labor cost inflation. The homebuilding industry has from time-to-time experienced labor shortages and other labor-related issues. These labor shortages can be more severe during periods of strong demand for housing, during periods following natural disasters or as a result of broader economic disruptions such as the COVID-19 pandemic. A number of factors may adversely affect the labor force available to us and our subcontractors in one or more of our markets, including high employment levels, federal unemployment subsidies, and other government regulations, which include laws and regulations related to workers’ health and safety, wage and hour practices and immigration. These factors can also impact the cost of labor. We have historically experienced high turnover rates among our direct labor employees, which can lead to increased spending on training and retention and, as a result, increased costs of production. An overall labor shortage or lack of skilled labor, increased turnover or labor inflation could cause significant increases in costs or delays in construction of homes, which could have a material adverse effect on our net sales and results of operations. 14 Complications with the implementation of our new e nterprise -wide system could adversely impact our business and operations. We rely on information systems and technology to manage our business and summarize and report our operating results. In fiscal 2022, we will begin a multi-year replacement of our current information systems with a suite of cloud-based functionality. With the new system, we expect to improve decision-making capabilities through real-time data and analytics, simplify and standardize business processes, reduce manual effort, improve value-added activities, and improve transparency and accountability all while enhancing the customer experience making our company easier to do business with. The system selection and implementation process has required, and will continue to require, a significant investment of personnel and financial resources. We may not be able to successfully implement the new system without experiencing delays, increased costs and other difficulties. If we are unable to successfully implement the system as planned, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted. Additionally, if we do not effectively implement the system as planned or it does not operate as intended, the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting could be adversely affected or our ability to assess those controls adequately could be delayed. If we are unable to establish or maintain relationships with independent distributors that sell our homes, our sales could decline and our results of operations and cash flows could suffer. Although we maintain our own factory direct retail business in select markets, we conduct a majority of our business through independent distributors. Over 90% of our shipments of homes in fiscal 2021 were made to independent distributors throughout the U.S. and western Canada. We may not be able to establish relationships with new independent distributors or maintain good relationships with independent distributors that sell our homes. Even if we establish and maintain relationships with independent distributors, these customers are not obligated to sell our homes exclusively and may choose to sell competitors’ homes instead. The independent distributors with whom we have relationships can cancel these relationships on short notice. In addition, these customers may not remain financially solvent, as they are subject to industry, economic, demographic, and seasonal trends similar to those faced by us. If we do not establish and maintain relationships with solvent independent distributors in the markets we serve, sales in those markets, if we cannot offset by sales through an expanded factory-direct retail business, could decline and our results of operations and cash flows could suffer. When we introduce new products into the marketplace, we may incur expenses that we did not anticipate, which, in turn, can result in reduced earnings. The introduction of new models, floor plans, and features are critical to our future success, but we may incur unexpected expenses when we make such introductions. For example, we may experience unexpected engineering or design flaws that may cause increased warranty costs. The costs resulting from these types of problems could be substantial and could have a significant adverse effect on our earnings. Estimated warranty costs are accrued at the time of product sale to reflect our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products. An increase in actual warranty claims costs as compared to our estimates could result in increased warranty reserves and expense, which could have adverse impacts on our earnings. Our products and services may experience quality problems from time to time that can result in decreased sales and gross margin and can harm our reputation. Our products contain thousands of parts, many of which are supplied by a network of approved vendors. Product defects may occur, including components purchased from material vendors. There is no assurance that all such defects will be detected prior to the distribution of our products. In addition, although we endeavor to compel suppliers to maintain appropriate levels of insurance coverage, there is no assurance that if a defect in a vendor-supplied part were to occur that the vendor would have the financial ability to rectify the defect. Failure to detect defects in our products, including vendor-supplied parts, could result in lost revenue, increased warranty and related costs, and could harm our reputation. We may not be able to manage our business effectively if we cannot retain current management team members or if we are unable to attract and motivate key personnel. Our success depends upon the skills, experience, and active participation of our senior management and key employees, many of whom have been with us for a significant number of years. Changes in our senior management team or other key employees may result in operational disruptions and changes to the strategy of our business, and our business might be harmed as a result. Our business could be further disrupted and harmed if we were unable to find appropriate replacements on a timely basis following future departures. 15 We may not be able to attract or motivate qualified management and operations personnel in the future. Inability to do so would result in constraints that would significantly impede the achievement of our objectives. We may also have difficulty attracting experienced personnel and may be required to expend significant financial resources in our employee recruitment efforts. Product liability claims and litigation and warranty claims that arise in the ordinary course of business may be costly, which could adversely affect our results of operations. As a home builder, we are subject to construction defect and home warranty claims arising in the ordinary course of business. These claims are common in the home building industry and can be costly. In addition, the costs of insuring against construction defect and product liability claims are high. There can be no assurance that this coverage will not be restricted and become more costly. If the limits or coverages of our current and former insurance programs prove inadequate, or we are unable to obtain adequate or reasonably-priced insurance against these types of claims in the future, or the amounts currently provided for future warranty or insurance claims are inadequate, then we may experience losses that could negatively impact our results of operations. We record expenses and liabilities based on the estimated costs required to cover our self-insured liability under our insurance policies, and estimated costs of potential claims and claim adjustment expenses that are above our coverage limits or that are not covered by our insurance policies. These estimated costs are based on an analysis of our historical claims and industry data, and include an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. Due to the degree of judgment required and the potential for variability in the underlying assumptions when deriving estimated liabilities, our actual future costs could differ from those estimated, and the difference could be material to our results of operations. Data security breaches, cybersecurity attacks, and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer. In the ordinary course of our business, we collect, use, and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our suppliers and business partners, as well as personally identifiable information of our customers and employees. We also have outsourced elements of our information technology structure, and as a result, we are managing independent vendor relationships with third parties who may or could have access to our confidential information. Similarly, our business partners and other third-party providers possess certain of our sensitive data. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance, or other disruptions, particularly with employees and others on data networks working increasingly from home because of the COVID-19 pandemic and other such factors. We, our partners, vendors, and other third-party providers could be susceptible to third-party attacks on our and their information security systems, which attacks are of ever-increasing levels of sophistication and are made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise, including criminal groups. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost, or stolen. Any such access, disclosure, or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, disrupt our operations, and damage our reputation, any of which could adversely affect our business. Engaging in mergers and acquisitions, such as the acquisition of ScotBilt Homes, involve risks that could adversely affect our business. As part of our growth strategy, we recently acquired ScotBilt Homes and may choose to engage in discussions and negotiations regarding additional mergers, acquisitions and other business combinations. The purchase price for possible acquisitions of businesses and assets might be paid from cash, borrowings, or through the issuance of common stock or other securities, or a combination of these methods. Business combinations entail numerous risks, including: • difficulties in the integration of acquired operations and products, which can impact the retention of customer accounts; • failure to achieve expected synergies, implement appropriate internal controls or integrate information systems; • diversion of management's attention from other business concerns; • assumption of unknown material liabilities of acquired companies, which could become material or subject us to litigation or regulatory risks; • amortization of acquired intangible assets, which could reduce future reported earnings; and • potential loss of customers or key employees. 16 We cannot be certain that we will be able to identify, consummate and successfully integrate business combinations, and no assurance can be given with respect to the timing, likelihood or business effect of any possible transaction. For example, we could begin negotiations that we subsequently decide to suspend or terminate for a variety of reasons. Also, business combinations are typically subject to closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and the absence of a material adverse change. Therefore, if and when we enter into a business combination agreement, there can be no guarantee that the transaction will close when expected, or at all. If a material transaction does not close, then our stock price could decline. Nevertheless, opportunities arise from time to time that we choose to evaluate. Any transactions that we pursue and consummate would involve these risks and uncertainties, as well as others. The risks of a business combination could result in the failure of the anticipated benefits of that particular combination to be realized, which in turn could have adverse effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Our risk management practices may leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risk. Our management team is responsible for managing risk, subject to oversight by our board of directors. Our risk management methods may not identify all future risk exposures and may not be completely effective in mitigating all key risks. Furthermore, our risk management methods may not properly identify and mitigate the aggregation of risks across the Company or the interdependency of our risk mitigation efforts. In addition, some of our risk management methods may be based on assumptions that will prove to be inaccurate. Failure to manage risk effectively could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Financial Risks Future increases in interest rates, more stringent credit standards, tightening of financing terms, or other increases in the effective costs of owning a factory-built home (including those related to regulation or other government actions) could limit the purchasing power of our potential customers and could adversely affect our business and financial results. A large portion of the people who buy our homes finance their home purchases through third-party lenders. Interest rates have been near historical lows for several years, which has made purchasing new factory-built homes more affordable. Increases in interest rates or decreases in the availability of consumer financing could adversely affect the market for homes. Potential customers may be less willing or able to pay the increased monthly costs or to obtain financing. In addition, recent increases in the prices of homes may limit consumers’ ability to obtain financing. Lenders may increase the qualifications needed for financing or adjust their terms to address any increased credit risk. These factors could adversely affect the sales or pricing of our factory-built homes. These developments have historically had, and may once again have, an adverse effect on the overall demand for factory-built housing and its competitiveness with other forms of housing and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. The liquidity provided by the GSEs and the FHA is also critical in insuring or purchasing home mortgages and creating or insuring investment securities that are either sold to investors or held in their portfolios. Any limitations or restrictions on the availability of financing by these agencies could adversely affect interest rates, financing, and our sales of new homes. The availability of wholesale financing for retailers is limited due to a limited number of floor plan lenders and reduced lending limits. Factory-built housing retailers generally finance their inventory purchases with wholesale floor plan financing provided by lending institutions. The availability of wholesale financing is significantly affected by the number of floor plan lenders and their lending limits. Limited availability of floor plan lending negatively affects the inventory levels of our independent retailers, the number of retail sales center locations and related wholesale demand, and adversely affects the availability of and access to capital on an ongoing basis. As a result, if the availability of wholesale financing is reduced, we could experience sales declines or a higher level of customer defaults and its operating results and cash flows could suffer. We have contingent repurchase obligations related to wholesale financing provided to industry retailers. As is customary in the factory-built housing industry, a significant portion of our manufacturing sales to independent retailers are financed under floor plan agreements with financing companies. In connection with the floor plan financing programs, we generally have separate agreements with the financing companies that require us to repurchase homes upon default by the retailer and repossession of the homes by the financing companies. The impact of COVID-19 may have an adverse impact on the solvency of independent industry retailers, and as a result, we may be required to honor the contingent repurchase agreements if the retailers default under terms of the floor plan financing arrangements. These repurchase agreements are applicable for various periods of time, generally up to 24 months after the sale of the home to the retailer. However, certain homes are subject to repurchase until the home is sold by the retailer. Our contingent repurchase obligation as of April 3, 2021, was estimated to be approximately $219.5 million, without reduction for the resale value of the homes. We may be required to honor contingent repurchase obligations in the future and may incur additional expense and reduced cash flows because of these repurchase agreements. 17 Industry conditions and future operating results could limit our sources of capital. If we are unable to locate suitable sources of capital when needed, we may be unable to maintain or expand our business. We depend on our cash balances, cash flows from operations, and our revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) to finance our operating requirements, capital expenditures, and other needs. If our cash balances, cash flows from operations, and availability under the Credit Facility are insufficient to finance our operations and alternative capital is not available, then we may not be able to expand our business and make acquisitions, or we may need to curtail or limit our existing operations. Changes in foreign exchange rates could adversely affect the value of our investments in Canada and cause foreign exchange losses. We have substantial investments in businesses in Canada. Unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates could adversely affect the value of our investments in these businesses. An impairment of all or part of our goodwill could adversely affect our operating results and net worth. As of April 3, 2021, 20.9% of our total assets consisted of goodwill, all of which is allocated to reporting units included in the U.S. Factory-built Housing segment. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") Accounting Standards Codification (""ASC"") 350, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other (""ASC 350""), we test goodwill at least annually for impairment or more often than annually if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment is more likely than not to have occurred. If goodwill has become impaired, we charge the impairment as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs. See Item 7, ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Policies"" and Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. A write-off of all or part of our goodwill could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. The replacement or modification of LIBOR as a reference rate could increase our interest expense in the future. The London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) is expected to be phased out by the end of 2021. LIBOR is currently used as the reference rate on our credit facility, which matures on June 5, 2023. Currently, no replacement rate has been identified. The transition from LIBOR could result in higher interest expense than has historically been recognized. Our failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could harm our business and financial results. Our management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that we would prevent or detect a misstatement of our financial statements or fraud. We anticipate paying no cash dividends for the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, for the foreseeable future, to fund the development and growth of our business. As a result, capital appreciation in the price of our common stock, if any, will be investors’ only source of gain on an investment in our common stock. Any future determination to pay dividends to shareholders will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including general economic conditions, our financial condition and results of operations, our available cash and current and anticipated cash needs, capital requirements, contractual, legal, tax and regulatory restrictions, the implications of the payment of dividends by us to our shareholders or by our subsidiaries to us, and any other factors that the board of directors may deem relevant. 18 ITEM 1B.

We also have 18 retail sales centers located across seven states in the U.S. and nine terminals for our logistics operations across five states in the U.S. The corporate offices, retail sales centers, and logistics terminals are leased properties. The contractual lease for our Troy, Michigan office expires in December 2022 and the contractual lease for our Elkhart, Indiana office expires in September 2023. Four of the above manufacturing facilities are encumbered under the revolving credit facility and two of the manufacturing facilities are encumbered by industrial revenue bonds. In the opinion of management, our properties have been well maintained, are in sound operating condition, and contain all equipment and facilities necessary to operate at present levels. We also own or lease six idle manufacturing facilities which could be utilized for additional production capacity. Those facilities would likely require capital investments in order to secure and equip them for operations. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS We are party to certain legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course and are incidental to our business. Certain of the claims pending against us in these proceedings allege, among other things, breach of express and implied warranties, and in various governmental agency proceedings arising from occupational safety and health, wage and hour, and similar employment and workplace regulations. Although litigation is inherently uncertain, based on past experience and the information currently available, management does not believe that the currently pending and threatened litigation or claims will have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations. However, future events or circumstances, currently unknown to us, will determine whether the resolution of pending or threatened litigation or claims will ultimately have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of operations in any future reporting periods.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following should be read in conjunction with Skyline Champion Corporation’s consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this Annual Report. Certain statements set forth below under this caption constitute forward-looking statements. See Part I, “Cautionary Statement About Forward-Looking Statements,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional factors relating to such statements, and see Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” of this Annual Report for a discussion of certain risks applicable to our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Overview The Company is a leading producer of factory-built housing in the U.S. and Canada. The Company serves as a complete solutions provider across complementary and vertically integrated businesses including manufactured construction, company-owned retail locations, and transportation logistics. The Company is the largest independent publicly traded factory-built solutions provider in North America based on revenue, and markets its homes under several nationally recognized brand names including Skyline Homes, Champion Home Builders, Genesis Homes, Athens Park Models, Dutch Housing, Excel Homes, Homes of Merit, New Era, Redman Homes, ScotBilt Homes, Shore Park, Silvercrest, and Titan Homes in the U.S. and Moduline and SRI Homes in western Canada. The Company operates 35 manufacturing facilities throughout the U.S. and five manufacturing facilities in western Canada that primarily construct factory-built, timber-framed manufactured and modular houses that are sold primarily to independent retailers, builders/developers, and manufactured home community operators. The Company’s retail operations consist of 18 sales centers that sell manufactured homes to consumers primarily in the southern U.S. The Company’s transportation business engages independent owners/drivers to transport manufactured homes, recreational vehicles, and other products throughout the U.S. and Canada. Acquisitions and Expansions Over the last several years, demand for the Company’s products, primarily affordable housing in the U.S., has continued to improve. As a result, the Company has focused on operational improvements to make existing manufacturing facilities more profitable as well as executing measured expansion of its manufacturing and retail footprints. The Company has increased capacity through strategic acquisitions and expansions of its manufacturing operations. The Company is focused on growing in strong HUD markets across the U.S. as well as further expanding into the Northeast and Midwest U.S. modular housing markets. On February 28, 2021, the Company acquired ScotBilt Homes, LLC and related companies from SHI Group Holdings, Inc. (collectively, “ScotBilt”). In calendar 2020, ScotBilt shipped over 1,600 homes from its two manufacturing facilities in Georgia providing affordable housing throughout Alabama, Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas. ScotBilt has approximately 400 employees in its two manufacturing facilities. The Company believes ScotBilt is an excellent fit given the compatible company cultures, and ScotBilt’s strong presence in the attractive mid-south region, which helps to balance national distribution and complements the Company’s existing manufacturing footprint. The operations of ScotBilt are included in the financial results of Skyline Champion since the date of the acquisition. On January 14, 2021, the Company acquired two idled facilities in Pembroke, North Carolina which may provide an opportunity to further expand its manufacturing footprint in the Southeast markets. The Company is currently assessing prospects for initiating production in one or both of those facilities. In addition to those acquisitions, the Company expanded capacity through initiating production at a previously idle manufactured housing facility in Leesville, Louisiana in June 2019. During fiscal 2019, the Company completed its expansion of the Corona, California facility by adding a second production line and expanded its Leola, Pennsylvania campus by adding an additional plant. Production at the Leola facility began in April 2019. The Exchange, discussed below, added eight manufacturing plants to the Company during fiscal 2019. These acquisitions and investments are part of a strategy to grow and diversify revenue with a focus on increasing the Company’s HUD and modular homebuilding presence in the U.S. as well as improving the results of operations. These acquisitions and investments are included in the consolidated results for periods subsequent to their respective acquisition dates. 24 Combination with Skyline On January 5, 2018, Champion Holdings and Skyline entered into an Exchange Agreement pursuant to which the two companies agreed to combine their operations. The Exchange was completed on June 1, 2018 and was accounted for as a reverse acquisition under the acquisition method of accounting as provided by FASB ASC 805, Business Combinations (“ASC 805”). Champion Holdings was determined to be the acquirer for accounting and financial reporting purposes. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed by Champion Holdings as a result of the Exchange were recorded at their respective fair values and added to the carrying value of Champion Holdings existing assets and liabilities. As Champion Holdings is the accounting acquirer, reported financial results for Skyline Champion Corporation for fiscal 2019 are comprised of: 1) the results of Champion Holdings through June 1, 2018 and 2) the combined operations of the Company, after giving effect to the Exchange, from June 1, 2018 through March 30, 2019. All annual periods presented prior to the effective date of the Exchange are comprised solely of the results of Champion Holdings and all annual periods presented subsequent to fiscal 2019 are comprised solely of the results of the Company. Industry and Company Outlook Since July 2020, U.S. and Canadian housing industry demand has been robust. The limited availability of existing homes for sale and the broader need for newly built affordable, single-family housing has continued to drive demand for new homes in these markets. In recent years, manufactured home construction experienced revenue growth due to a number of favorable demographic trends and demand drivers in the United States, including underlying growth trends in key homebuyer groups, such as the population over 55 years of age, the population of first-time home buyers, and the population of households earning less than $60,000 per year. More recently, we have seen a number of market trends pointing to increased sales of ADUs and urban-to-rural migration as customers accommodate working-from-home patterns, as well as people seeking rent-to-own single-family options. The robust demand environment has resulted in backlog at the end of fiscal 2021 of $858.6 million compared to $127.5 million at the end of fiscal 2020. Generally higher backlog at our manufacturing facilities creates an opportunity to increase production efficiencies. Although the higher demand brings opportunities, it also has resulted in significant increases in certain material input costs, especially forest products. We manage our business to anticipate these cost increases and generally are able to pass them along to our customers. For fiscal 2021, approximately 77% of the Company’s U.S. manufacturing sales were generated from the manufacture of homes that comply with the Federal HUD code construction standard in the U.S. According to data reported by MHI, HUD-code industry home shipments were 95,588, 97,553 and 93,377 units during fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Based on industry data, the Company’s U.S. wholesale market share of HUD code homes sold was 16.9%, 16.5%, and 16.6% in fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Annual shipments have generally increased each year since calendar year 2009 when only 50,000 HUD-coded manufactured homes were shipped, the lowest level since the industry began recording statistics in 1959. While shipments of HUD-coded manufactured homes have improved modestly in recent years, manufactured housing’s most recent annual shipment levels still operate at lower levels than the long-term historical average of over 200,000 units annually. COVID-19 Pandemic The outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (""COVID-19"") was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. There remains continued uncertainty regarding the extent and duration of the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on the economy, the housing market, and the Company, as well as the Company’s employees, customers, and suppliers. The Company has prioritized the safety and well-being of its employees and customers and has implemented standards to operate in accordance with social-distancing protocols and public health authority guidelines. Beginning in March 2020, the Company took actions to temporarily idle certain facilities in response to government shutdown orders or reduced demand. By late April 2020, most of the temporarily idled manufacturing facilities had reopened, but at reduced production levels due to employee absenteeism, difficulty hiring new team members and social distancing protocols. As of April 3, 2021, only one manufacturing facility remained temporarily idled due to labor availability constraints. During fiscal 2021, the Company experienced intermittent closures of its manufacturing facilities due to COVID-19 outbreaks at the facilities or surrounding communities causing higher than normal absenteeism. By the end of the fiscal year, the Company was able to increase daily production rates over the levels achieved in the prior year period as direct labor staffing levels increased and production efficiencies improved. The Company’s availability of labor and certain materials was negatively impacted throughout fiscal 2021, and remains subject to disruption and uncertainty. Prices for key raw materials have experienced increased volatility and, overall, manufacturing costs have trended higher than prior periods. Since the start of the fiscal year, the Company’s retail operations have adjusted their operating procedures to comply with local and state mandates, and have generally remained open but have shifted from physical visits to a larger online presence. The Company 25 consolidated its retail footprint by closing three retail sales centers during the second quarter of fiscal 2021 in an effort to optimize costs while taking advantage of an increase in distribution through digital marketing efforts. We have strong local independent retailers to serve customers in those areas . In response to the pandemic, the Company offered extended benefits to employees, including increased sick pay and waived premium payments on healthcare benefits for furloughed employees. The Company’s U.S. operations incurred $2.2 million of expense related to those extended benefits. Various government programs provided financial relief for affected businesses, including the Employee Retention Credit under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (""CARES Act"") and state level programs in the United States and the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (""CEWS"") under the COVID-19 Economic Response Plan in Canada. CEWS provides a cash subsidy of up to 75% of eligible employees’ remuneration, subject to certain criteria. The Company recognized $6.2 million for payroll subsidies under CEWS during fiscal 2021. The Company also recognized $0.7 million during the fiscal year for wage subsidies under the CARES Act and other state level programs in the United States. In addition, the CARES Act allows for deferring payment of certain payroll taxes. Through April 3, 2021, the Company has deferred $11.8 million of payroll taxes that will be paid beginning in December 2021.

Fiscal 2021 was a 53-week period and fiscal 2020 was a 52-week period. The results of operations and discussion below should be read considering the impact of an additional week of operation in fiscal 2021. NET SALES The following table summarizes net sales for fiscal 2021 and 2020: Year Ended (Dollars in thousands) April 3, 2021 March 28, 2020 $ Change % Change Net sales $ 1,420,881 $ 1,369,730 $ 51,151 3.7 % U.S. manufacturing and retail net sales $ 1,266,308 $ 1,226,393 $ 39,915 3.3 % U.S. homes sold 19,983 20,110 (127 ) (0.6 %) U.S. manufacturing and retail average home selling price $ 63.4 $ 61.0 $ 2.4 3.9 % Canadian manufacturing net sales $ 101,328 $ 84,196 $ 17,132 20.3 % Canadian homes sold 1,231 1,002 229 22.9 % Canadian manufacturing average home selling price $ 82.3 $ 84.0 $ (1.7 ) (2.0 %) Corporate/Other net sales $ 53,245 $ 59,141 $ (5,896 ) (10.0 %) U.S. manufacturing facilities in operation at year end 35 33 2 6.1 % U.S. retail sales centers in operation at year end 18 21 (3 ) (14.3 %) Canadian manufacturing facilities in operation at year end 5 5 — — % Net sales for fiscal 2021 were $1,420.9 million, an increase of $51.2 million, or 3.7%, over fiscal 2020. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. U.S. Factory-built Housing: Fiscal 2021 net sales for the Company’s U.S. manufacturing and retail operations increased by $39.9 million, or 3.3%, over fiscal 2020 primarily due to the extra week of production in fiscal 2021, additional revenue generated from the ScotBilt operations and a 3.9% increase in ASP resulting from price increases enacted to offset raw material inflation. Net sales were negatively impacted by a reduction in the number of homes sold during the period, primarily a result of COVID-19 related plant shutdowns in the first quarter of the fiscal year. Although COVID-19 had a negative effect on demand and our ability to produce homes in the first half of the fiscal year, overall, the impact of the virus on consumer behavior have been favorable driving significant improvement in demand in the second half of the fiscal year. As a result, our production rate at the end of the year was higher than immediately prior to the outbreak. Canadian Factory-built Housing: The Canadian Factory-built Housing segment net sales increased by $17.1 million, or 20.3%, for fiscal 2021 compared to the prior year, primarily due to a 22.9% increase in homes sold, offset by a 2.0% decrease in ASP. Although volume was up, we saw a shift in consumer preferences to smaller homes which led to the decrease in ASP. Demand for housing in Canada improved during fiscal 2021 as a result of COVID-19 similar to the market factors witnessed in the U.S., offsetting a trend of decreasing demand experienced in recent years. Net sales for the Canadian segment were also favorably impacted by approximately $0.5 million as the Canadian dollar strengthened relative to the U.S. dollar during fiscal 2021 as compared to the same period of the prior year. Corporate/Other: Net sales for Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation business and the elimination of intersegment sales. For fiscal 2021, net sales for the segment decreased by $5.9 million, or 10.0%, compared to fiscal 2020. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower net sales in the Company’s transportation business to third-party customers, primarily a result of lower shipments of recreational vehicles (“RV”) in the U.S., as well as changes in customer mix. Similar to the manufactured housing industry, RV demand was initially negatively impacted by COVID-19, but has rebounded more recently. 27 GROSS PROFIT The following table summarizes gross profit for fiscal 2021 and 2020 : Year Ended (Dollars in thousands) April 3, 2021 March 28, 2020 $ Change % Change Gross profit: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 252,880 $ 250,222 $ 2,658 1.1 % Canadian Factory-built Housing 21,552 16,512 5,040 30.5 % Corporate/Other 13,263 12,241 1,022 8.3 % Total gross profit $ 287,695 $ 278,975 $ 8,720 3.1 % Gross profit as a percent of net sales 20.2 % 20.4 % Gross profit as a percent of sales during fiscal 2021 was 20.2% compared to 20.4% during fiscal 2020. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. U.S. Factory-built Housing: Gross profit for the U.S. Factory-built Housing segment increased by $2.7 million, or 1.1%, during fiscal 2021 compared to the prior year. The increase in gross profit is due to the increase in revenue in fiscal 2021. As a percent of net sales, g ross profit was 20.0% for fiscal 2021 compared to 20.4% in the prior year. The year-over-year decrease in gross margin was primarily due to rapid increases in raw material inflation, especially related to forest products. In addition, in response to the pandemic, the Company offered extended benefits to employees, including increased sick pay and waived premium payments on healthcare benefits for furloughed employees. Finally, gross margin was negatively impacted by production inefficiency caused by higher than normal employee absenteeism as well as social distancing protocols caused by COVID-19. Canadian Factory-built Housing: Gross profit for the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment increased by $5.0 million, or 30.5%, during fiscal 2021 compared to the prior year due to the increase in revenue. Gross margin increased to 21.3% as a percent of segment net sales from 19.6% due to direct labor and manufacturing efficiencies from the increase in home sales volumes. Corporate/Other: Gross profit for the Corporate/Other segment increased by $1.0 million, or 8.3%, during fiscal 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year. Corporate/Other gross profit improved as a percent of segment net sales to 24.9% from 20.7%. Gross margin for the Company’s transportation business improved due to a change in revenue mix and lower variable expenses. The change in revenue mix is primarily due to transporting a larger percentage of manufactured homes during the year which generally have a higher gross margin. SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Selling, general, and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses include foreign currency transaction gains and losses, equity compensation, and intangible amortization expense. The following table summarizes selling, general, and administrative expenses for fiscal 2021 and 2020: Year Ended (Dollars in thousands) April 3, 2021 March 28, 2020 $ Change % Change Selling, general, and administrative expenses: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 126,141 $ 135,329 $ (9,188 ) (6.8 %) Canadian Factory-built Housing 9,059 8,313 746 9.0 % Corporate/Other 43,736 48,878 (5,142 ) (10.5 %) Total selling, general, and administrative expenses $ 178,936 $ 192,520 $ (13,584 ) (7.1 %) Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales 12.6 % 14.1 % 28 SG&A expenses were $178.9 million for fiscal 2021, a decrease of $13.6 million compared to the prior year. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. U.S. Factory-built Housing: SG&A expenses for the U.S. Factory-built Housing segment decreased by $9.2 million, or 6.8%, during fiscal 2021 as compared to the prior year. SG&A expenses, as a percent of segment net sales, were 10.0% for fiscal 2021 compared to 11.0% for fiscal 2020. SG&A costs decreased due to a combination of factors primarily driven by reductions of approximately $8.0 million for travel and marketing related expenses mostly due to COVID-19, offset in part by: (i) higher incentive compensation, which is generally based on sales volume or a measure of profitability, (ii) an increase in salaries and benefits to maintain competitive compensation packages to retain and recruit team members, (iii) the addition of the ScotBilt operations subsequent to the acquisition, and (iv) the extra week of operations in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020. Canadian Factory-built Housing: SG&A expenses for the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment increased by $0.7 million, or 9.0%, during fiscal 2021 as compared to the prior year. SG&A expenses, as a percent of segment net sales, were 8.9% for fiscal 2021 compared to 9.9% for fiscal 2020. The increase in cost is generally a function of the increase in net sales and profits for the segment which translates to higher sales commissions and incentive compensation. Corporate/Other: SG&A expenses for Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation operations, corporate costs incurred for all segments, and intersegment eliminations. SG&A expenses for Corporate/Other decreased by $5.1 million, or 10.5%, during fiscal 2021 as compared to the prior year. SG&A expenses, as a percent of segment net sales, were 82.1% for fiscal 2021 compared to 82.6% for fiscal 2020. The decrease is mainly due to: (i) lower equity-based compensation expense of $2.2 million, (ii) $2.7 million of non-recurring costs in fiscal 2020 related to finalizing the integration of Skyline, and (iii) $1.5 million of non-recurring expense in fiscal 2020 for the impairment of certain fixed assets, partially offset by $3.4 million of costs incurred in fiscal 2021 related to investments in the development of our digital customer experience. INTEREST EXPENSE The following table summarizes the components of interest expense, net for fiscal 2021 and 2020: Year Ended (Dollars in thousands) April 3, 2021 March 28, 2020 $ Change % Change Interest expense $ 3,813 $ 4,632 $ (819 ) (17.7 %) Interest income (565 ) (3,231 ) 2,666 (82.5 %) Interest expense, net $ 3,248 $ 1,401 $ 1,847 131.8 % Average outstanding floor plan payable $ 26,992 $ 31,962 Average outstanding long-term debt $ 64,663 $ 48,747 Interest expense, net was $3.2 million for fiscal 2021, an increase of $1.8 million compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily related to lower interest income recognized during the period even though the Company has increased its average cash balances. Average rates of interest decreased significantly in fiscal 2021 negatively impacting interest income. The decrease in interest rates favorably impacted interest expense for our floor plan payable balance and long-term debt. The weighted average interest rate on our revolving credit facility was 1.8% in fiscal 2021 compared to 3.5% in fiscal 2020. The weighted average interest rate on the floorplan payable was 5.1% at April 3, 2021 compared to 5.7% at March 28, 2020. OTHER INCOME, NET The following table summarizes other income, net for fiscal 2021 and 2020: Year Ended (Dollars in thousands) April 3, 2021 March 28, 2020 $ Change % Change Other income, net $ (5,889 ) $ — $ (5,889 ) * * indicates that the calculated percentage is not meaningful 29 Other income, net for fiscal 2021 primarily consisted of income related to wage subsidies provided by certain U.S. and Canadian government sponsored financial assistance programs enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company recognized $6.2 million for payroll subsidies under CEWS, and $0.7 million under the CARES Act. The Company incurred transaction costs of $1.0 million during fiscal 2021 related to the acquisition of ScotBilt, partially offsetting the payroll subsidies. INCOME TAX EXPENSE The following table summarizes income tax expense for fiscal 2021 and 2020: Year Ended (Dollars in thousands) April 3, 2021 March 28, 2020 $ Change % Change Income tax expense $ 26,501 $ 26,894 $ (393 ) (1.5 %) Effective tax rate 23.8 % 31.6 % Income tax expense for fiscal 2021 was $26.5 million, representing an effective tax rate of 23.8%, compared to income tax expense of $26.9 million, representing an effective tax rate of 31.6%, for fiscal 2020. The Company’s effective tax rate for fiscal 2021 differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of 21.0%, due primarily to the effect of non-deductible expenses, tax credits, state and local income taxes, and results in foreign jurisdictions. The Company’s effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 differed from the federal statutory income tax rate of 21.0%, due primarily to the effect of non-deductible expenses, tax credits, state and local income taxes, changes in valuation allowances, and results in foreign jurisdictions. ADJUSTED EBITDA The following table reconciles net income, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, to Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, for fiscal 2021 and 2020: Year Ended (Dollars in thousands) April 3, 2021 March 28, 2020 $ Change % Change Net income $ 84,899 $ 58,160 $ 26,739 46.0 % Income tax expense 26,501 26,894 (393 ) (1.5 %) Interest expense, net 3,248 1,401 1,847 131.8 % Depreciation and amortization 17,704 18,546 (842 ) (4.5 %) Equity-based compensation (for awards granted prior to December 31, 2018) 1,359 4,576 (3,217 ) (70.3 %) Transaction costs 1,044 — 1,044 * Acquisition integration costs — 2,674 (2,674 ) * Fair market value adjustment for asset classified as held for sale — 986 (986 ) * Property, plant, and equipment impairment charge — 550 (550 ) * Restructuring costs and other — 577 (577 ) * Adjusted EBITDA $ 134,755 $ 114,364 $ 20,391 17.8 % * indicates that the calculated percentage is not meaningful Adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2021 was $134.8 million, an increase of $20.4 million over fiscal 2020. The increase is primarily a result of increased operating income after adjusting for the effect of depreciation and amortization, transaction, integration and restructuring costs, and non-cash equity-based compensation incurred in connection with the Exchange. The increase in operating income is primarily due to increases in net sales, gross profit and lower selling, general, and administrative costs. See the definition of Adjusted EBITDA under “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for additional information regarding the definition and use of this metric in evaluating the Company’s results. 30 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR FISCAL 2020 VS. 2019 Year Ended (Dollars in thousands) March 28, 2020 March 30, 2019 Results of Operations Data: Net sales $ 1,369,730 $ 1,360,043 Cost of sales 1,090,755 1,114,684 Gross profit 278,975 245,359 Selling, general, and administrative expenses 192,520 275,101 Operating income (loss) 86,455 (29,742 ) Interest expense, net 1,401 3,290 Other expense — 8,271 Income (loss) from operations before income taxes 85,054 (41,303 ) Income tax expense 26,894 16,905 Net income (loss) $ 58,160 $ (58,208 ) Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA: Net income (loss) $ 58,160 $ (58,208 ) Income tax expense 26,894 16,905 Interest expense, net 1,401 3,290 Depreciation and amortization 18,546 16,079 Equity-based compensation (for awards granted prior to December 31, 2018) 4,576 101,025 Transaction costs — 8,201 Acquisition integration costs 2,674 7,966 Restructuring costs 366 1,640 Fair market value adjustment for assets classified as held for sale 986 — Property, plant, and equipment impairment charge 550 — Other 211 193 Adjusted EBITDA $ 114,364 $ 97,091 As a percent of net sales: Gross profit 20.4 % 18.0 % Selling, general and administrative expenses 14.1 % 20.2 % Operating (loss) income 6.3 % (2.2 %) Net income (loss) 4.2 % (4.3 %) Adjusted EBITDA 8.3 % 7.1 % NET SALES The following table summarizes net sales for fiscal 2020 and 2019: Year Ended (Dollars in thousands) March 28, 2020 March 30, 2019 $ Change % Change Net sales $ 1,369,730 $ 1,360,043 $ 9,687 0.7 % U.S. manufacturing and retail net sales $ 1,226,393 $ 1,177,687 $ 48,706 4.1 % U.S. homes sold 20,110 19,443 667 3.4 % U.S. manufacturing and retail average home selling price $ 61.0 $ 60.6 $ 0.4 0.7 % Canadian manufacturing net sales $ 84,196 $ 98,567 $ (14,371 ) (14.6 %) Canadian homes sold 1,002 1,232 (230 ) (18.7 %) Canadian manufacturing average home selling price $ 84.0 $ 80.0 $ 4 5.0 % Corporate/Other net sales $ 59,141 $ 83,789 $ (24,648 ) (29.4 %) U.S. manufacturing facilities in operation at year end 33 31 2 6.5 % U.S. retail sales centers in operation at year end 21 21 — — % Canadian manufacturing facilities in operation at year end 5 5 — — % 31 Net sales for fiscal 2020 were $1,369.7 million, an increase of $9.7 million, or 0.7% over fiscal 2019. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. U.S. Factory-built Housing: Sales of homes for the Company’s U.S. manufacturing and retail operations increased by $48.7 million, or 4.1%. The net sales increase was attributable to the following factors including: (i) an increase of 667, or 3.4%, in the number of homes sold and (ii) a 0.7% increase in the average home selling price. The inclusion of the Skyline operations for the full year of fiscal 2020 added $48.2 million of sales, as fiscal 2019 included only ten months of Skyline operations. Canadian Factory-built Housing: The Canadian Factory-built Housing segment net sales decreased by $14.4 million, or 14.6% for fiscal 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to an 18.7% decrease in homes sold. This decrease was partially offset by a 5.0% increase the average selling price of homes. The number of homes sold decreased due to the decline in factory-built housing demand in the British Columbia and Alberta provinces versus the same period in the prior year. The decline in demand was and is due to oil and energy-related market dynamics in western Canada. Net sales for the Canadian segment were also unfavorably impacted by approximately $1.3 million as the Canadian dollar weakened relative to the U.S. dollar during fiscal 2020 as compared to the same period of the prior year. Corporate/Other: Net sales for Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation business and the elimination of intersegment sales. For fiscal 2020, net sales decreased by $24.6 million, or 29.4%. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower net sales in the Company’s transportation business primarily as a result of lower shipments associated with reduced RV demand in the U.S. and changes in customer mix, partially offset by increased net sales of manufactured housing products. GROSS PROFIT The following table summarizes gross profit for fiscal 2020 and 2019: Year Ended (Dollars in thousands) March 28, 2020 March 30, 2019 $ Change % Change Gross profit: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 250,222 $ 214,142 $ 36,080 16.8 % Canadian Factory-built Housing 16,512 18,309 (1,797 ) (9.8 %) Corporate/Other 12,241 12,908 (667 ) (5.2 %) Total gross profit $ 278,975 $ 245,359 $ 33,616 13.7 % Gross profit as a percent of net sales 20.4 % 18.0 % Gross profit as a percent of sales during fiscal 2020 was 20.4% compared to 18.0% during fiscal 2019. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. U.S. Factory-built Housing: Gross profit for the U.S. Factory-built Housing segment increased by $36.1 million, or 16.8%, during fiscal 2020 compared to the prior year. The increase in gross profit is due to the increase in sales volume and improved margins resulting from a reduction in manufacturing costs. Gross profit was 20.4% as a percent of segment net sales for fiscal 2020 compared to 18.2% in the prior year. Gross profit expansion was driven by favorable material pricing, procurement and operational synergies related to the Exchange, and plant operating improvements, all of which were partially offset by labor inflation. Canadian Factory-built Housing: Gross profit for the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment decreased by $1.8 million, or 9.8%, during fiscal 2020 compared to the prior year and increased to 19.6% as a percent of segment net sales from 18.6%. Although the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment saw lower volume compared to the prior period, margins improved due to higher average selling prices on homes sold. 32 Corporate/Other: Gross profit for the Corporate/Other segment decreased by $0.7 million, or 5.2%, during fiscal 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year. However, Corporate/Other gross profit improved as a percent of segment net sales to 20.7% from 15.4%. Gross margins for the Company’s transportation business improved as a percent of sales due to a change in revenue mix and lower variable expenses. A portion of the change in revenue mix is due in part to changes in the customer base, which included less brokered business to other providers at lower margins in response to the decline in revenue caused by the softening market demand for RVs . SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES: The following table summarizes selling, general, and administrative expenses for fiscal 2020 and 2019: Year Ended (Dollars in thousands) March 28, 2020 March 30, 2019 $ Change % Change Selling, general, and administrative expenses: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 135,329 $ 116,379 $ 18,950 16.3 % Canadian Factory-built Housing 8,313 9,058 (745 ) (8.2 %) Corporate/Other 48,878 149,664 (100,786 ) (67.3 %) Total selling, general, and administrative expenses $ 192,520 $ 275,101 $ (82,581 ) (30.0 %) Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales 14.1 % 20.2 % Selling, general, and administrative expenses were $192.5 million for fiscal 2020, a decrease of $82.6 million compared to the prior year. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. U.S. Factory-built Housing: Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the U.S. Factory-built Housing segment increased by $19.0 million, or 16.3%, during fiscal 2020 as compared to the prior year. Selling, general, and administrative expenses, as a percent of segment net sales, was 11.0% for fiscal 2020 compared to 9.9% during fiscal 2019. SG&A costs increased due to a combination of factors, and was primarily driven by: (i) an increase in salaries and benefits to maintain competitive compensation packages to retain and recruit team members, and (ii) higher sales commissions and incentive compensation, which is generally based on sales volume or a measure of profitability. The increase in salaries, benefits, and incentive compensation was approximately $7.7 million in total. In addition, the inclusion of the Skyline operations for all twelve months of fiscal 2020 increased SG&A expenses by $4.7 million compared to fiscal 2019, which included only ten months of Skyline operations. Lastly, the Company recorded additional SG&A costs for the Leesville, LA capacity expansion of $2.0 million and increased spending on marketing and advertising initiatives of $1.0 million during fiscal 2020. Canadian Factory-built Housing: Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment decreased by $0.7 million, or 8.2%, during fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019. As a percent of segment net sales, selling, general, and administrative expenses for the Canadian segment was 9.9% for fiscal 2020 compared to 9.2% for fiscal 2019. Selling, general, and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales increased in the current period due to the decrease in net sales and reduced leverage of fixed costs. 33 Corporate/Other: Selling, general, and administrative expenses for Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation operations, corporate costs incurred for all segments, and intersegment eliminations. Selling, general, and administrative expenses for Corporate/Other decreased by $100.8 million, or 67.3%, during fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019. The decrease is mainly due to a change in equity-based compensation expense of $93.7 million, primarily related to the Exchange and secondary offerings that occurred in the prior year, as well as a reduction in acquisition integration and restructuring costs of $6.6 million. This decrease was partially offset by a fair market value adjustment charge of $1.0 million related to property acquired in the Exchange. INTEREST EXPENSE, NET The following table summarizes the components of interest expense, net for fiscal 2020 and 2019: Year Ended (Dollars in thousands) March 28, 2020 March 30, 2019 $ Change % Change Interest expense $ 4,632 $ 5,333 $ (701 ) (13.1 %) Interest income (3,231 ) (2,043 ) (1,188 ) 58.1 % Interest expense, net $ 1,401 $ 3,290 $ (1,889 ) (57.4 %) Average outstanding floor plan payable $ 31,962 $ 32,288 Average outstanding long-term debt $ 48,747 $ 58,959 Interest expense, net was $1.4 million for fiscal 2020, a decrease of $1.9 million compared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily related to higher interest income recognized during the period as a result of higher average cash balances invested in short term facilities. In addition, the Company incurred reduced interest expense due to; (i) a lower weighted average interest rate on its revolving credit facility of 3.5% as compared to 4.7%, and (ii) lower average outstanding balances on its credit facilities as compared to the same period in the prior year. OTHER EXPENSE The following table summarizes other expense for fiscal 2020 and 2019: Year Ended (Dollars in thousands) March 28, 2020 March 30, 2019 $ Change % Change Other expense $ — $ 8,271 $ (8,271 ) (100.0 %) Other expense for fiscal 2019 primarily consisted of $8.2 million of expenses for legal, accounting, and advisory services related to the Exchange and four offerings of the Company’s common stock subsequent to the Exchange (“Offerings”), as well as $0.1 million for the deductible on an insured loss at one of the Company’s retail sales centers. The Company incurred no such costs in fiscal 2020. Income Tax Expense The following table summarizes income tax expense for fiscal 2020 and 2019: Year Ended (Dollars in thousands) March 28, 2020 March 30, 2019 $ Change % Change Income tax expense $ 26,894 $ 16,905 $ 9,989 59.1 % Effective tax rate 31.6 % (40.9 %) Income tax expense for fiscal 2020 was $26.9 million, representing an effective tax rate of 31.6%, compared to income tax expense of $16.9 million, representing an effective tax rate of (40.9%), for fiscal 2019. 34 The Company’s effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of 21.0%, due primarily to the effect of non-deductible expenses, tax credits, state and local income taxes, changes in valuation allowances, and results in foreign jurisdictions . The Company’s effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 differed from the federal statutory income tax rate of 21.0%, due primarily to the effect of non-deductible expenses, many of which were a result of the Exchange, state and local income taxes, and results in foreign jurisdictions. Adjusted EBITDA The following table reconciles net income, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, to Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, for fiscal 2020 and 2019: Year Ended (Dollars in thousands) March 28, 2020 March 30, 2019 $ Change % Change Net income (loss) $ 58,160 $ (58,208 ) $ 116,368 * Income tax expense 26,894 16,905 9,989 59.1 % Interest expense, net 1,401 3,290 (1,889 ) (57.4 %) Depreciation and amortization 18,546 16,079 2,467 15.3 % Equity-based compensation (for awards granted prior to December 31, 2018) 4,576 101,025 (96,449 ) * Transaction costs — 8,201 (8,201 ) (1.00 ) Acquisition integration costs 2,674 7,966 (5,292 ) * Fair market value adjustment for asset classified as held for sale 986 — 986 * Property, plant, and equipment impairment charge 550 — 550 * Restructuring costs and other 577 1,833 (1,256 ) * Adjusted EBITDA $ 114,364 $ 97,091 $ 17,273 17.8 % * indicates that the calculated percentage is not meaningful Adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2020 was $114.4 million, an increase of $17.3 million over fiscal 2019. The increase is primarily a result of increased operating income after adjusting for the effect of increased depreciation and amortization, transaction, integration and restructuring costs, and non-cash equity-based compensation incurred in connection with the Exchange, and the Offerings and the integration of Skyline. The increase in operating income is primarily due to improvements in sales volumes and gross profit margins as a percent of net sales partially offset by higher selling, general, and administrative costs. See the definition of Adjusted EBITDA under “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for additional information regarding the definition and use of this metric in evaluating the Company’s results. BACKLOG Although orders from customers can be cancelled at any time without penalty, and unfilled orders are not necessarily an indication of future business, the Company’s unfilled U.S. and Canadian manufacturing orders at April 3, 2021 totaled $858.6 million compared to $127.5 million at March 28, 2020. The increase in backlog is driven by increased demand for single-family homes which has resulted in order levels that have significantly outpaced production in both the U.S. and Canada. Production levels, which vary by plant, gradually increased each quarter in fiscal 2021 and surpassed last year’s average daily production rates in both the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2021. Increasing production rates to keep pace with orders is limited by individual plant capacity, time to train new employees, employee attendance and availability of materials. Production may also be limited by additional instances of COVID-19 related impacts, including intermittent facility shutdowns and supply channel disruption, including most recently raw material allocations by certain suppliers. 35 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The following table presents summary cash flow information for fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019: Year Ended (Dollars in thousands) April 3, 2021 March 28, 2020 March 30, 2019 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 153,897 $ 76,743 $ 65,228 Investing activities (56,808 ) (14,093 ) (2,030 ) Financing activities (47,813 ) 21,569 (72,518 ) Effect of exchange rate changes 3,850 (1,398 ) (662 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash 53,126 82,821 (9,982 ) Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash at beginning of period 209,455 126,634 136,616 Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash at end of period $ 262,581 $ 209,455 $ 126,634 The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and existing cash balances. Cash balances and cash flow from operations for the next year are expected to be adequate to cover working capital requirements, fund capital expenditures, and floor plan payment obligations. The Company does not have any scheduled long term debt maturities in the next twelve months. The Company’s revolving credit facility includes a leverage ratio covenant that requires the Company’s first lien debt levels to remain less than 2.75x consolidated trailing twelve-month EBITDA. The leverage ratio was increased to 3.0x consolidated trailing twelve-month EBITDA for the four quarters after the acquisition of ScotBilt. The Company anticipates compliance with its leverage ratio debt covenant and projects its level of cash availability to be in excess of cash needed to operate the business for the next year. In the event operating cash flow and existing cash balances were deemed inadequate to support the Company’s liquidity needs, and one or more capital resources were to become unavailable, the Company would revise operating strategies accordingly. Cash provided by operating activities was $153.9 million in fiscal 2021 compared to $76.7 million in fiscal 2020. Cash was generated by operating income (before non-cash charges) from higher sales and operating margins compared to the prior year. Operating cash was also favorably impacted by changes in other working capital items, primarily an increase in customer deposits of $36.4 million. We generally collect a deposit at the time an order is placed by a customer. The significant increase in backlog discussed above drove the increase in deposits. We expect deposit levels to return to historical levels in the future which will negatively impact operating cash flows. The favorable changes in working capital items were partially offset by an increase in inventory compared to the prior period which was a result of rising material prices and increasing the amount of raw materials stocked as a result of supply channel challenges. Cash provided by operating activities was $76.7 million in fiscal 2020 compared to $65.2 million in fiscal 2019. Cash was generated by operating income (before non-cash charges) from higher sales and operating margins compared to the prior year. Additionally, there were no transaction expenses incurred for the Skyline acquisition or secondary offering costs in fiscal 2020 compared to $8.2 million in the same period of the prior year. The increase was partially offset by cash used for other working capital items. Cash used in investing activities was $56.8 million in fiscal 2021 versus $14.1 million in 2020. The increase is primarily related to the cash paid for the acquisition of ScotBilt, net of cash acquired, of $52.5 million, partially offset by a decrease in capital expenditures compared to the prior year. Cash used in investing activities was $14.1 million in fiscal 2020 versus $2.0 million in 2019. The increase is primarily related to the benefit of $9.7 million of cash acquired in the Exchange in fiscal 2019, and an increase in capital expenditures of $3.3 million, partially offset by proceeds of $1.1 million from the disposition of a held for sale property. The expenditures for capital items are part of the Company’s focus on safety and operating efficiency initiatives as well as the expansion of production capacity. In fiscal 2021, cash used in financing activities was $47.8 million, versus the prior year which had net cash provided by financing activities of $21.6 million. Cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2021 is primarily a result of payments made on the revolving credit facility and floor plan financing facilities totaling $38.0 million and $8.2 million, respectively. In fiscal 2020, cash provided by financing activities was $21.6 million, versus the prior year which had net cash used in financing activities of $72.5 million. 36 On June 5, 2018, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the “ Credit Agreement ”) with a syndicate of banks. The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility of up to $100.0 million , including a letter of credit sub-facility of not less than $45.0 million . Initial borrowings in fiscal 2019 under the Credit Agreement were used to repay the Company’s prior $46.9 million term loans and replace the Company’s prior cash collateralized stand-alone letter of credit facility. The interest rate on borrowing under the Credit Agreement is based on LIBOR and was 1.6% at April 3, 2021 . The Company borrowed $38.0 million under the Credit Agreement in March 2020 to maximize financial flexibility in response to the impact of COVID-19. Those funds were repaid during fiscal 2021. The Company ha d $ 42.7 million available to borrow against the Credit Agreement at April 3, 2021 . CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS Credit Facility The Credit Agreement matures on June 5, 2023 and has no scheduled amortization. The interest rate under the Credit Agreement will adjust based on the first lien net leverage of the Company which will range from a high of LIBOR plus 2.25% and ABR plus 1.25% when first lien net leverage is equal to or greater than 2.00:1.00, to a low of LIBOR plus 1.50% and ABR plus 0.50% when first lien net leverage is below 0.50:1.00. In addition, the Company is obligated to pay a commitment fee ranging between 0.25% and 0.40% (depending on first lien net leverage) in respect of unused commitments under the Credit Agreement. Letter of Credit Facility The Company has a letter of credit sub-facility under the Credit Agreement. At April 3, 2021, letters of credit issued under the sub-facility totaled $30.4 million. Industrial Revenue Bonds Obligations under industrial revenue bonds are supported by letters of credit and bear interest based on a municipal bond index rate. The industrial revenue bonds require lump-sum payments of principal upon maturity in 2029. Floor Plan Payable At April 3, 2021, the Company had outstanding borrowings on floor plan financing arrangements of $25.7 million. The Company’s retail operations utilize floor plan financing to fund the acquisition of manufactured homes for display or resale. The arrangements provide for borrowings up to $48.0 million. Borrowings are secured by the homes acquired and are required to be repaid when the Company sells the financed home to a customer. Contingent Obligations The Company has contingent liabilities and obligations at April 3, 2021, including surety bonds and letters of credit totaling $34.4 million and $30.4 million, respectively. Additionally, the Company is contingently obligated under repurchase agreements with certain lending institutions that provide floor plan financing to independent retailers. The contingent repurchase obligation as of April 3, 2021 is approximately $219.5 million, without reduction for the resale value of the homes. The Company has the ability to resell the repurchased collateral to other retailers, and losses incurred on repurchased homes have been insignificant in recent periods. The reserve for estimated losses under repurchase agreements was $1.4 million at April 3, 2021. See “ Critical Accounting Polices – Reserve for Repurchase Commitments ” below. The Company has provided various representations, warranties, and other standard indemnifications in the ordinary course of its business in agreements to acquire and sell business assets and in financing arrangements. The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of its business. In the normal course of business, the Company’s subsidiaries historically provided certain parent company guarantees to two U.K. customers. These guarantees provided contractual liability for proven construction defects up to 12 years from the date of delivery of the units. The guarantees remain a contingent liability subsequent to the fiscal 2017 disposition of the U.K. operations, which declines over time through October 2027. As of the date of this report, no claims have been reported under the terms of the guarantees. Management believes the ultimate liability with respect to these contingent obligations will not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 37 NON - GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES - A DJUSTED EBITDA The Company defines Adjusted Earnings Before Interest Taxes and Depreciation and Amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA ”) as net income or loss plus; (a) the provision for income taxes; (b) interest expense, net; (c) depreciation and amortization; (d) gain or loss from discontinued operations; (e) equity based compensation for awards granted prior to December 31, 2018; (f) non-cash restructuring charges and impairment of assets; and (g) other non-operating costs including those for the acquisition and integration or disposition of businesses and idle facilities. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of earnings calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income or loss prepared on a U.S. GAAP basis. Adjusted EBITDA does not purport to represent cash flow provided by, or used in, operating activities as defined by U.S. GAAP, which is presented in the Statement of Cash Flows. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is presented as a supplemental measure of the Company’s financial performance that management believes is useful to investors, because the excluded items may vary significantly in timing or amounts and/or may obscure trends useful in evaluating and comparing the Company’s operating activities across reporting periods. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA is useful to an investor in evaluating operating performance for the following reasons: (i) Adjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors to measure a company’s operating performance without regard to items such as interest income and expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization and equity-based compensation, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and the book value of assets, capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired; and (ii) analysts and investors use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to evaluate the overall operating performance of companies in the industry. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA for planning purposes, including the preparation of internal annual operating budget and periodic forecasts: (i) in communications with the board of directors and investors concerning financial performance; (ii) as a factor in determining bonuses under management’s annual incentive compensation program; and (iii) as a measure of operating performance used to determine the ability to provide cash flows to support investments in capital assets, acquisitions and working capital requirements for operating expansion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1, ""Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,"" to the consolidated financial statements included in this Report. Certain of our accounting policies require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Assumptions and estimates of future earnings and cash flow are used in the periodic analyses of the recoverability of goodwill, intangible assets, deferred tax assets and property, plant, and equipment. Historical experience and trends are used to estimate reserves, including reserves for self-insured risks, warranty costs, and wholesale repurchase losses. The Company considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the estimate would have had a significant impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. The Company believes that the following discussion addresses the Company’s critical accounting estimates. Acquisitions We allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the assets and liabilities, if any, is recorded as goodwill. We use all available information to estimate fair values. We typically engage outside appraisal firms to assist in the fair value determination of identifiable intangible assets and any other significant assets or liabilities. We adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation, as necessary, up to one year after the acquisition closing date as we obtain more information regarding asset valuations and liabilities assumed. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but that are inherently uncertain, and therefore, may not be realized. Unanticipated events or circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy of our fair value estimates, including assumptions regarding industry economic factors and business strategies. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the estimates, assumptions, and values reflected in the valuations will be realized, and actual results could vary materially. Reserves for Self-Insured Risks The Company is self-insured for a significant portion of its general insurance, product liability, workers’ compensation, auto, health, and property insurance. Insurance coverage is maintained for catastrophic exposures and those risks required to be insured by law. The Company is liable for the first $150,000 of incurred losses for each workers’ compensation and auto liability claim and is responsible for losses up to the first $500,000 per occurrence for general, product liability, and property insurance. Generally catastrophic losses are insured up to $50 million. The health plan is subject to a stop-loss limit of $500,000 per occurrence. Estimated self-insurance costs are accrued for all expected future expenditures for reported and unreported claims based on historical experience. 38 Warranty Reserves The Company’s factory-built housing operations generally provide each retail homebuyer or builder/developer with a 12-month assurance warranty from the date of retail purchase. Estimated warranty costs are accrued as cost of sales at the time of sale. Warranty provisions and reserves are based on various factors, including estimates of the amounts necessary to settle existing and future claims on homes sold as of the balance sheet date. Factors used in the estimation of the warranty liability include the estimated amount of warranty and customer service costs incurred for homes that remain in retailers’ inventories before delivery to the consumer, homes purchased by consumers still within the warranty period, the timing in which work orders were completed, and the historical average costs incurred to service a home. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets It is the Company’s policy to evaluate the recoverability of property, plant, and equipment whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable, primarily based on estimated selling price, appraised value, or projected undiscounted future cash flows. Impairment of Goodwill Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually. Impairment testing is required more often if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment is more likely than not to have occurred. In conducting its annual impairment testing, the Company may first perform a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount. If not, no further goodwill impairment testing is required. If it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount, or if the Company elects not to perform a qualitative assessment of a reporting unit, the Company then compares the fair value of the reporting unit to the related net book value. If the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is measured and recognized. As the analysis depends upon judgments, estimates and assumptions, such testing is subject to inherent uncertainties, which could cause the fair value to fluctuate from period to period. In fiscal 2021, the Company performed qualitative assessments of its reporting units. The annual assessment was completed on of the first day of March. The assessments indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded its respective carrying value. The Company does not believe that any reporting units are at risk for impairment. Income Taxes and Deferred Tax Assets Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided when the Company determines that it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Reserve for Repurchase Commitments As is customary in the factory-built housing industry, a significant portion of the manufacturing operations’ sales to independent retailers are made pursuant to repurchase agreements with lending institutions that provide wholesale floor plan financing to the retailers. Certain homes sold pursuant to repurchase agreements are subject to repurchase, generally up to 24 months after the sale of the home to the retailer. Certain other homes sold pursuant to repurchase agreements are subject to repurchase until the home is sold by the retailer. For those homes with an unlimited repurchase period, the Company’s risk of loss upon repurchase declines due to required monthly principal payments by the retailer. After 24 or 30 months from the date of the Company’s sale of the home, the risk of loss on these homes is low, and by the 46th month, most programs require that the home be paid in full, at which time the Company no longer has risk of loss. Pursuant to these agreements, during the repurchase period, generally upon default by the retailer and repossession by the financial institution, the Company is obligated to repurchase the homes from the Floor Plan Lender. The contingent repurchase obligation as of April 3, 2021, is estimated to be approximately $219.5 million, without reduction for the resale value of the homes. Losses under repurchase obligations represent the difference between the repurchase price and net proceeds from the resale of the homes, less accrued rebates, which will not be paid. Losses incurred on homes repurchased have been insignificant in recent periods. The reserve for estimated losses under repurchase agreements was $1.4 million at April 3, 2021. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Off balance sheet arrangements at April 3, 2021 consist of the contingent repurchase obligation totaling approximately $219.5 million, letters of credit totaling $30.4 million, and surety bonds totaling $34.4 million. See “Contractual Obligations and Commitments – Contingent Obligations” and “Critical Accounting Policies – Reserve for Repurchase Commitments” above for more information related to these off balance sheet arrangements. 39 OTHER MATTERS Inflation Inflation of raw materials, especially commodities such as forest products, was significant during fiscal 2021. The raw material price increases have generally been passed on to customers or mitigated through working with supply chain partners, sourcing alternative materials or other operational improvements to minimize the effect on profitability. However, continued, frequent and sudden increases in specific costs, as well as price competition, can affect the ability to pass on costs and adversely impact results of operations. Therefore, there is no assurance that inflation or the impact of rising material costs will not have a significant impact on revenue or results of operations in the future. Seasonality The housing industry, which includes factory-built homes, is affected by seasonality. Sales during the period from March to November are traditionally higher than other months. As a result, quarterly results of a particular period are not necessarily representative of the results expected for the year. Recently Issued Accounting Standards Refer to Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” in our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding new accounting pronouncements. 40 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Risk Debt obligations under the Credit Agreement are subject to variable rates of interest based on LIBOR, the administrative agent’s prime rate or the U.S. federal funds rate. A 100 basis point increase in the underlying interest rate would result in an additional annual interest expense of approximately $0.3 million, assuming related debt of $26.9 million, which is the amount of outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement at April 3, 2021. Obligations under industrial revenue bonds are subject to variable rates of interest based on a municipal bond index rate. A 100 basis point increase in the underlying interest rates would result in additional annual interest expense of approximately $0.1 million, assuming related debt of $12.4 million, which is the amount of outstanding borrowings on industrial revenue bonds at April 3, 2021. Obligations under floor plan financing arrangements are subject to variable rates of interest based on terms negotiated with the floor plan lenders. A 100 basis point increase in the underlying interest rates would result in additional annual interest expense of approximately $0.3 million, assuming related floor plan borrowings of $25.7 million, which is the amount of outstanding borrowings on floor plan financing at April 3, 2021. The Company’s approach to interest rate risk is to balance borrowings between fixed rate and variable rate debt as management deems appropriate. At April 3, 2021, the Company’s borrowings under the Credit Agreement, industrial revenue bonds and floor plan financing arrangements are all at variable rates. Foreign Exchange Risk The Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk with its factory-built housing operations in Canada. The Canadian operations had fiscal 2021 net sales of $133.9 million Canadian dollars. Assuming future annual Canadian net sales equivalent to fiscal 2021, a change of 1.0% in exchange rates between the U.S. and Canadian dollars would change consolidated sales by $1.3 million. The Company also has foreign exchange risk for cash balances maintained in Canadian dollars that are subject to fluctuating values when exchanged into U.S. dollars. The Company does not financially hedge its investment in the Canadian operations or in Canadian denominated bank deposits. ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Financial statements and supplementary data are filed herewith under Item 15. ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company’s management, with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of April 3, 2021. Based on that evaluation, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of April 3, 2021. (b) Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, internal controls over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 41 (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company's assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, and that the Company's receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, the Company's controls and procedures may not prevent or detect misstatements. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all controls systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (""2013 Framework""). Management excluded ScotBilt, which was acquired on February 28, 2021, from its assessment of the internal control over financial reporting. This acquired business comprised 6.9% of total assets as of April 3, 2021 and 0.7% of net sales for the year ended April 3, 2021. Based on management's evaluation under the criteria in the 2013 Framework, management concluded that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of April 3, 2021. (c) Attestation Report of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Ernst & Young LLP, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, audited the Company’s consolidated financial statements set forth in this Annual Report and issued an attestation report regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of April 3, 2021, and the attestation report is set forth in Item 15, ""Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,"" under the caption ""Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control over Financial Reporting"" and is incorporated herein by reference. (d) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended April 3, 2021 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at April 3, 2021 and March 28, 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the fiscal years ended April 3, 2021, March 28, 2020, and March 30, 2019, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of April 3, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated May 26, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company‘s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company‘s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts and disclosures to which it relates. Workers’ Compensation Description of the Matter The Company had workers’ compensation reserves of $16.3 million as of April 3, 2021. As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company is self-insured for a significant portion of its workers’ compensation obligations. Workers’ compensation costs are accrued for incurred claims and estimated claims incurred but not yet reported. Auditing the Company’s workers’ compensation reserve is complex and requires the involvement of actuarial specialists due to the measurement uncertainty associated with the estimate of the ultimate loss projection and the use of various actuarial methods. F-2 How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company’s controls over the workers’ compensation reserve process. For example, we tested controls over management’s review of the workers’ compensation reserve calculations, the appropriateness of the assumptions management used in the calculation and controls pertaining to the completeness and accuracy of the claim data underlying the reserve. To evaluate the reserve for workers’ compensation, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, testing the completeness and accuracy of the incurred claims underlying the reserve, obtaining legal confirmation letters to evaluate reserves in consideration of litigated matters, and reviewing the Company’s reinsurance contracts to assess the Company’s self-insurance retentions. Furthermore, we involved our actuarial specialists to assist in our evaluation of methodologies and assumptions applied by management to establish the workers’ compensation reserve. We compared the Company’s reserve to a range developed by our actuarial specialists based on assumptions independently developed by our specialists. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP We have served as the Company‘s auditor since 2006. Detroit, Michigan May 26, 2021 F-3 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Skyline Champion Corporation Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have audited Skyline Champion Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of April 3, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Skyline Champion Corporation (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of April 3, 2021, based on the COSO criteria. As indicated in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management’s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of ScotBilt Homes LLC (“ScotBilt”), which is included in the 2021 consolidated financial statements of the Company and constituted 6.9% of total assets as of April 3, 2021 and 0.7% of revenues for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of ScotBilt. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of April 3, 2021 and March 28, 2020, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), equity and cash flows for each of the fiscal years ended April 3, 2021, March 28, 2020, and March 30, 2019, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) and our report dated May 26, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. F-4 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP Detroit, Michigan May 26, 2021 F-5 Skyline Champion Corporation Consolidated Balance Sheets (Dollars and shares in thousands, except per share amounts) April 3, 2021 March 28, 2020 ASSETS Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 262,581 $ 209,455 Trade accounts receivable, net 57,481 45,733 Inventories, net 166,113 126,386 Other current assets 13,592 17,239 Total current assets 499,767 398,813 Long-term assets: Property, plant, and equipment, net 115,140 109,291 Goodwill 191,803 173,521 Amortizable intangible assets, net 58,835 43,357 Deferred tax assets 19,914 21,812 Other noncurrent assets 32,443 34,906 Total assets $ 917,902 $ 781,700 LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY Current liabilities: Floor plan payable $ 25,733 $ 33,914 Accounts payable 57,214 38,703 Other current liabilities 180,695 114,030 Total current liabilities 263,642 186,647 Long-term liabilities: Long-term debt 39,330 77,330 Deferred tax liabilities 4,280 3,264 Other 42,039 40,144 Total long-term liabilities 85,649 120,738 Stockholders' Equity: Common stock, $ 0.0277 par value, 115,000 shares authorized, 56,640 and 56,665 shares issued (including 0 and 145 shares subject to restriction) as of April 3, 2021 and March 28, 2020, respectively 1,569 1,570 Additional paid-in capital 491,668 485,552 Retained earnings (accumulated deficit) 82,898 ( 48 ) Accumulated other comprehensive loss ( 7,524 ) ( 12,759 ) Total equity 568,611 474,315 Total liabilities and stockholders' equity $ 917,902 $ 781,700 See accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation: On June 1, 2018, Skyline Champion Corporation (formerly known as Skyline Corporation), an Indiana corporation (the “Company”) and Champion Enterprises Holdings, LLC (“Champion Holdings”) completed the transactions contemplated by the Share Contribution & Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”), dated as of January 5, 2018, by and between the Company and Champion Holdings. Under the Exchange Agreement: (i) Champion Holdings contributed to the Company all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of each of Champion Holdings’ wholly-owned operating subsidiaries (the “Contributed Shares”); and (ii) in exchange for the Contributed Shares, the Company issued to the members of Champion Holdings, in the aggregate, 47,752,008 shares of the Company common stock (“Skyline Common Stock”) (such issuance, the “Shares Issuance”). Immediately following the Shares Issuance, the members of Champion Holdings collectively held 84.5 %, and the Company’s pre-closing shareholders collectively held 15.5 %, of the issued and outstanding Skyline Common Stock on a fully-diluted basis. The contribution of the Contributed Shares by Champion Holdings to Skyline, and the Shares Issuance by the Company to the members of Champion Holdings are collectively referred to herein as the “Exchange.” The Exchange was treated as a purchase of the Company by Champion Holdings for accounting and financial reporting purposes. As a result, the financial results for the twelve months ending March 30, 2019 are comprised of: (i) the results of Champion Holdings for the period between April 1, 2018 and May 31, 2018; and (ii) the Company, after giving effect to the Exchange, from June 1, 2018 through March 30, 2019. COVID-19 Government Financial Assistance: The outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (""COVID-19"") was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. Various government programs have been announced to provide financial relief for affected businesses, including the Employee Retention Credit under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (""CARES Act"") and state level programs in the United States and the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (""CEWS"") under the COVID-19 Economic Response Plan in Canada. The Company recognized $ 6.2 million for payroll subsidies under CEWS during fiscal 2021. The Company also recognized $ 0.7 million during fiscal 2021 for wage subsidies under the CARES Act and other state level programs in the United States. The Company’s policy is to account for these subsidies as Other Income in the period in which the related costs are incurred and the Company is reasonably assured to receive payment. As of April 3, 2021, the Company had collected all of the CEWS subsidies for which it has applied. In addition, the CARES Act allows for deferring payment of certain payroll taxes. Through April 3, 2021, the Company has deferred $ 11.8 million of payroll taxes that will be paid beginning in December 2021 . Nature of Operations: The Company’s operations consist of manufacturing, retail and transportation activities. At April 3, 2021, the Company operated 35 manufacturing facilities throughout the United States (“U.S.”) and five manufacturing facilities in western Canada that primarily construct factory-built, timber-framed manufactured and modular houses that are sold primarily to independent retailers, builders/developers, and manufactured home community operators. The Company’s retail operations consist of 18 sales centers that sell manufactured houses to consumers primarily in the Southern U.S. The Company’s transportation business engages independent owners/drivers to transport recreational vehicles throughout the U.S. and Canada and manufactured houses in certain regions of the U.S. The Company also has holding companies located in the Netherlands. Principles of Consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, its wholly owned subsidiaries, and its majority-owned subsidiaries which it controls. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Variable Interest Entities and Joint Ventures : The Company analyzes its investments in non-wholly owned subsidiaries to determine whether they are unconsolidated joint ventures, consolidated joint ventures, or variable interest entities (“VIEs”) and, if so, whether the Company is the primary beneficiary in accordance with ASC 810, Consolidation . Accounting Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“US. GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto. Estimates made in preparing the accompanying consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, business combinations, reserves for obsolete inventory, accrued warranty costs, useful lives of fixed and intangible assets, asset impairment analyses, insurance reserves, legal reserves, repurchase reserves, share- F-11 based compensation and deferred tax valuation allowances Actual results could differ from those estimates, making it reasonably possible that a change in these estimates could occur within one year. Fiscal Year: The Company’s fiscal year is a 52- or 53-week period that ends on the Saturday nearest March 31. Fiscal 2021 includes the 53-weeks ended April 3, 2021. Fiscal 2020 and 2019 include the 52-weeks ended March 28, 2020 and March 30, 2019, respectively . Revenue Recognition: Revenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of a contract are satisfied which generally occurs at a point in time through the transfer of control of promised goods to the Company's customers. Control transfers once a customer has the ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the benefits from, the product. This includes the transfer of legal title, physical possession, the risks and rewards of ownership, and customer acceptance. Sales revenue is reported net of applicable sales tax. See Note 9, Revenue Recognition, for additional information. Cost of Sales: Cost of sales includes manufacturing costs such as: (i) materials; (ii) compensation and employee benefits for direct and indirect labor; (iii) fixed and variable manufacturing overhead costs; (iv) warranty costs; (v) inbound delivery costs; and (vi) depreciation of buildings and equipment. Manufacturing overhead costs include costs such as: (i) utilities; (ii) workers’ compensation and product liability self-insurance; (iii) real and personal property taxes on buildings and equipment; (iv) manufacturing supplies; (v) repairs and maintenance; and (vi) rents and leases for buildings and equipment. Cost of sales also includes certain post-manufacturing costs, to the extent such costs are the Company’s responsibility. Post-manufacturing costs may include delivery and setup, foundations, craning, roofing, exterior cladding, interior finishing, utility connections and other miscellaneous site costs. Generally, subcontractors are engaged to perform post-manufacturing activities. Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses: Selling, general, and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) include costs such as (i) salaries, wages, incentives and employee benefits for executive, management, sales, engineering, accounting, information technology (“IT”) and administrative employees; (ii) sales commissions; (iii) marketing and advertising costs; (iv) legal and professional fees; (v) depreciation, rents and leases for administrative facilities, office equipment, IT equipment and computer software; and (vi) postage, office supplies, travel and telephone expenses. Advertising Costs and Delivery Costs and Revenue : Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and are included in selling, general, and administrative expenses. Total advertising expense was approximately $ 1.7 million, $ 2.3 million, and $ 1.5 million for fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Delivery costs are included in cost of sales and delivery revenue is included in net sales. Foreign Currency: Translation adjustments of the Company’s international subsidiaries for which the local currency is the functional currency are reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. Fair Value: The Company estimates the fair value of its financial instruments in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measuremen t , which establishes a fair value hierarchy and requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. As such, the fair value of financial instruments is estimated using available market information and other valuation methods. The Company groups assets and liabilities at fair value in three levels, based on the inputs and assumptions used to determine fair value. These levels are: • Level 1—Fair value determined based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. • Level 2—Fair value determined using significant observable inputs, generally either quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities or quoted prices in markets that are not active. • Level 3—Fair value determined using significant observable inputs, such as pricing models, discounted cash flows, or similar techniques. The Company records accounts receivable, accounts payable and other current liabilities at cost. The carrying value of these instruments approximate their fair value due to their short-term maturities. F-12 Cash and Cash Equivalents : Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments that have original maturities less than 90 days at the time of their purchase. These investments are carried at cost, which approximates market value because of their short maturities. Trade Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: The Company extends credit terms on a customer-by-customer basis in the normal course of business and, as such, trade accounts receivable are subject to customary credit risk. The allowance for doubtful accounts represents the Company's best estimate of probable credit losses in accounts receivable. Receivables are written off against the allowance when management believes that the amount receivable will not be recovered. At both April 3, 2021 and March 28, 2020, the Company had an allowance for doubtful accounts of $ 0.4 million. Inventories : Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost determined under the first-in, first-out method. Capitalized manufacturing costs include the cost of materials, labor and manufacturing overhead. Retail inventories of new manufactured homes built by the Company are valued at manufacturing cost, including materials, labor and manufacturing overhead, or net purchase price if acquired from unaffiliated third parties. Property, Plant, and Equipment : Property, plant, and equipment are stated at acquisition date cost. Depreciation is provided principally on the straight-line method, generally over the following estimated useful lives: land improvements— 3 to 10 years ; buildings and improvements— 8 to 25 years ; and vehicles and machinery and equipment— 3 to 8 years . Depreciation expense was $ 12.1 million, $ 13.1 million, and $ 11.3 million for fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively . At April 3, 2021, the Company owned five idle manufacturing facilities and two idle retail sales centers with a net book value of $ 6.8 million. These properties are accounted for as long-lived assets to be held and used. It is the Company’s policy to evaluate the recoverability of property, plant, and equipment whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable. If impairment indicators exist, the Company performs the required impairment analysis by comparing the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the long-lived assets to the related net book values. If the net book value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is measured and recognized. An impairment loss is measured as the difference between the net book value and the fair value of the long-lived assets. Fair value is estimated based upon a combination of market and cost approaches, as appropriate. An impairment loss of $ 0.6 million was recorded in selling, general, and administrative expenses in fiscal 2020 related to a decrease in the estimated fair value of the Company’s idle manufacturing facilities. No impairment losses were recorded in either fiscal 2021 or 2019 . Leases: The Company has operating leases for land, manufacturing and office facilities, and equipment. The Company’s lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such option. The Company's leases do not contain material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease terms. The Company has elected not to recognize any right of use asset or lease liability for leases with an initial term of 12 months or less and has elected not to separate lease and non-lease components. The discount rate used to measure a lease obligation should be the rate implicit in the lease; however, the Company’s operating leases generally do not provide an implicit rate. Accordingly, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate at lease commencement to determine the present value of lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is an entity-specific rate which represents the rate of interest a lessee would pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term with similar payments. Assets held for sale: Long-lived assets expected to be sold or otherwise disposed of within one year are classified as assets held for sale and included in other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets. In connection with the Exchange, the Company acquired an office building which was classified as an asset held for sale as of March 30, 2019, valued at $ 2.1 million. In the first quarter of fiscal 2020, a loss of $ 1.0 million was recorded in selling, general, and administrative expenses to recognize a decrease in the fair value of the building, which was sold for $ 1.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2020. Goodwill : The Company tests goodwill for impairment in accordance with ASC 350. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment on at least an annual basis. Impairment testing is required more often than annually if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment is more likely than not to have occurred. In conducting its annual impairment testing, the Company may first perform a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount. If not, no further goodwill impairment testing is required. If it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount, or if the Company elects not to perform a qualitative assessment of a reporting unit, the Company then compares the F-13 fair value of the reporting unit to the related net book value. If the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is measured and recognized. In fiscal 2021, the Company performed qualitative assessments of its reporting units. The annual assessment was completed on the first day of March. The assessment indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded its respective carrying value. The Company does not believe that any reporting units are at risk for impairment. Business combinations: The Company accounts for its business combinations in accordance with the accounting guidance in ASC 805. The purchase price of an acquired business is allocated to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the assets and liabilities, if any, is recorded as goodwill. Determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management’s judgment, the utilization of independent appraisal firms and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the timing and amount of future cash flows, market rate assumptions, actuarial assumptions, and appropriate discount rates, among other items. Refer to Note 2, Business Combination, for additional information. Amortizable Intangible Assets : Amortizable intangible assets consist primarily of fair values assigned to customer relationships and trade names. Trade names were valued based upon the relief-from-royalty method and customer relationships were valued based upon the multi-period excess earnings method. Amortization is provided over the useful lives of the intangible assets, generally up to ten years , using the straight-line method. The recoverability of amortizable intangible assets is evaluated whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recovered, in accordance with the recognition and measurement provisions of ASC 360. Warranty Obligations : The Company’s manufactured housing operations generally provides the homebuyer with an assurance warranty from the date of respective purchase. Estimated warranty costs are accrued as cost of sales at the time of sale. Warranty provisions and reserves are based on estimates of the amounts necessary to settle existing and future claims on homes sold by the manufacturing segment as of the balance sheet date. Factors used to calculate the warranty obligation are the estimated number of homes still under warranty and the historical average costs incurred to service a home. Dealer Volume Rebates : The Company’s manufacturing segment sponsors volume rebate programs under which sales to retailers and builder/developers can qualify for cash rebates generally based on the level of sales attained during a twelve-month period. Volume rebates are accrued at the time of sale and are recorded as a reduction of net sales. Repurchase Agreements: The Company is contingently liable under terms of repurchase agreements with lending institutions that provide wholesale floor plan financing to retailers. These arrangements, which are customary in the industry, provide for the repurchase of products sold to retailers in the event of default by the retailer on their agreement to pay the financial institution. The risk of loss from these agreements is spread over numerous retailers. The repurchase price is generally determined by the original sales price of the product less contractually defined curtailment payments. The Company accounts for the guarantee under its repurchase agreements with the retailers’ financing institutions by estimating and deferring a portion of the related product sale that represents the estimated fair value of the guarantee. Accrued Self-Insurance : The Company is self-insured for a significant portion of its workers’ compensation, general and product liability, auto liability, health, and property insurance. Insurance coverage is maintained for catastrophic exposures and those risks required to be insured by law. Estimated self-insurance costs are accrued for incurred claims and estimated claims incurred but not yet reported. At April 3, 2021 and March 28, 2020, the Company had gross reserves for estimated losses related to workers’ compensation obligations of $ 16.3 million and $ 16.5 million, respectively. The Company also recorded expected reimbursements for the portion of those losses above respective program limits of $ 5.2 million and $ 6.1 million at April 3, 2021 and March 28, 2020, respectively. Equity-Based Compensation: Stock-based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is generally recognized as expense ratably on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. Forfeitures are recognized in the period in which they occur. Comprehensive Income and Loss: Components of comprehensive income and loss are changes in equity other than those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners. The aggregate amount of such changes to equity that have not yet been recognized in net income or loss are reported in the equity section of the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, net of tax. F-14 Income Taxes : The provision for income taxes is calculated using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent upon the generation of future taxable income. In determining the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns, judgment is required. On March 29, 2020, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (""ASU"") 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments ,” using a modified retrospective approach. The standard amends several aspects of the measurement of credit losses related to certain financial instruments, including the replacement of the existing incurred credit loss model and other models with the current expected credit losses (""CECL"") model. The cumulative effect of adoption resulted in an increase of $ 0.2 million in the allowance for credit loss and a corresponding decrease in retained earnings as of March 29, 2020. The Company’s allowance for credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost reflects management’s estimate of credit losses over the remaining expected life of such assets, measured primarily using historical experience, as well as current economic conditions and forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. Expected credit losses for newly recognized financial assets, as well as changes to expected credit losses during the period, are recognized in earnings. At both April 3, 2021 and March 28, 2020, accounts receivable are reflected net of reserves of $ 0.4 million. Other notes receivable are reflected net of reserves of $ 0.4 million and $ 0.5 million at April 3, 2021 and March 28, 2020, respectively . In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, “ Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350), Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment,” which addresses concerns over the cost and complexity of the two-step impairment testing model, and removes the second step of the test. An entity will apply a one-step quantitative test and record the amount of goodwill impairment as the excess of a reporting unit’s carrying amount over its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. The Company adopted the provisions of ASU 2017-04 effective March 29, 2020, and the adoption did not have an impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Pending Adoption: There were no accounting standards recently issued that are expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations. 2. Business Combination ScotBilt Acquisition On February 28, 2021, the Company acquired 100 % of the membership interests of ScotBilt Homes, LLC and related companies (“ScotBilt”), a builder of manufactured homes with annual revenues of approximately $ 79.0 million, for a purchase price of $ 53.0 million. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, the purchase price was adjusted for cash held by ScotBilt at the closing date and working capital adjustments resulting in total purchase consideration of $ 54.5 million and total cash paid to sellers of $ 54.1 million. The Company accounted for the acquisition as a business combination under the acquisition method of accounting provided by FASB ASC 805, Business Combinations (“ASC 805”). As such, the purchase price was allocated to the net assets acquired, inclusive of intangible assets, with the excess fair value recorded to goodwill. Due to the limited amount of time that has passed since acquiring ScotBilt, the purchase price allocation for this acquisition is preliminary and could change. The preliminary allocation of the purchase price was as follows: (Dollars in thousands) Cash $ 1,542 Trade accounts receivable 2,256 Inventory 6,923 Property, plant, and equipment 10,466 Other assets 1,164 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities ( 7,243 ) Intangibles 21,100 Goodwill 18,282 Total purchase price allocation $ 54,490 F-15 Goodwill is primarily attributable to expected synergies from the combination of the companies, including, but not limited to, expected cost synergies through procurement activities and operational improvements through sharing of best practices. Goodwill, which is deductible for income tax purposes, was allocated to the U.S. Factory-built Housing reporting unit. Cash, trade accounts receivable, inventory, other assets, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities were generally stated at historical carrying values given the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities. Intangible assets include $ 13.0 million in customer relationships and $ 8.1 million associated with the ScotBilt trade name and were based on an independent appraisal. The fair value of the customer relationships was determined using the multi-period excess earnings method and the fair value of the trade name was determined using the relief-from-royalty method. The Company estimates that each intangible asset has a weighted average useful life of ten years from the acquisition date. Fair value estimates of property, plant, and equipment were based on independent appraisals, giving consideration to the highest and best use of the assets. Key assumptions used in the appraisals were based on a combination of market, cost, and sales comparison approaches, as appropriate. Level 3 fair value estimates of $ 10.5 million related to property, plant, and equipment and $ 21.1 million related to intangible assets were recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of April 3, 2021. For further information on acquired assets measured at fair value, see Note 5, Goodwill and Intangible Assets. The acquisition of ScotBilt was a taxable business combination. Therefore, the Company’s tax basis in the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed approximate the respective fair values at the acquisition date. 3 . Inventories, net The components of inventory, net of reserves for obsolete inventory, were as follows: (Dollars in thousands) April 3, 2021 March 28, 2020 Raw materials $ 91,916 $ 55,408 Work in process 21,642 17,773 Finished goods and other 52,555 53,205 Total inventories $ 166,113 $ 126,386 At April 3, 2021 and March 28, 2020, reserves for obsolete inventory were $ 4.6 million and $ 4.2 million, respectively. 4 . Property, Plant, and Equipment Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated primarily on the straight-line method, generally over the following estimated useful lives: land improvements – 3 to 10 years ; buildings and improvements – 8 to 25 years ; and vehicles and machinery and equipment – 3 to 8 years . Depreciation expense, for the fiscal years ended April 3, 2021, March 28, 2020, and March 30, 2019 was $ 12.1 million, $ 13.1 million, and $ 11.3 million, respectively. The components of property, plant, and equipment were as follows: (Dollars in thousands) April 3, 2021 March 28, 2020 Land and improvements $ 36,470 $ 35,332 Buildings and improvements 97,005 87,222 Machinery and equipment 57,790 51,239 Construction in progress 1,889 1,810 Property, plant, and equipment, at cost 193,154 175,603 Less accumulated depreciation ( 78,014 ) ( 66,312 ) Property, plant, and equipment, net $ 115,140 $ 109,291 5 . Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. At April 3, 2021 and March 28, 2020, the Company had goodwill of $ 191.8 million and $ 173.5 million, respectively. The change in the goodwill balance during the period was a result of the acquisition F-16 of ScotBilt. Goodwill is allocated to reporting units included in the U.S. Factory-built Housing segment, which include the Company’s U.S. manufacturing and retail operations . Intangible Assets The components of amortizable intangible assets were as follows: (Dollars in thousands) April 3, 2021 March 28, 2020 Customer Relationships Trade Names Total Customer Relationships Trade Names Total Gross carrying amount $ 61,963 $ 21,409 $ 83,372 $ 48,370 $ 13,068 $ 61,438 Accumulated amortization ( 18,158 ) ( 6,379 ) ( 24,537 ) ( 13,118 ) ( 4,963 ) ( 18,081 ) Amortizable intangibles, net $ 43,805 $ 15,030 $ 58,835 $ 35,252 $ 8,105 $ 43,357 Weighted average remaining amortization period, in years 7.8 7.9 7.8 7.3 6.2 7.1 The Company recognized customer relationships of $ 13.0 million and trade names of $ 8.1 million related to the acquisition of ScotBilt. The fair value of the customer relationship intangible asset was estimated using the multi-period excess earnings method of the income approach. The fair value of the customer relationship intangible asset was determined based on estimates and assumptions of projected cash flows attributable to the acquired customer relationships, the annual attrition rate of existing customer relationships, the contributory asset charges attributable to the assets that support the customer relationships, such as: (i) net working capital; (ii) property, plant, and equipment; (iii) trade names; and (iv) workforce, with the economic life and the discount rate as determined at the time of the acquisition. The fair value of the trade names intangible asset was estimated using the relief-from-royalty method of the income approach. The fair value of the trade names intangible asset was determined based on estimates and assumptions of the expected life of the intangible asset, the royalty rate, and the discount rate that reflects the level of risk associated with the future cash flows, as determined at the time of the acquisition. Amortization of intangible assets for the fiscal years ended April 3, 2021, March 28, 2020, and March 30, 2019 was $ 5.6 million, $ 5.4 million, and $ 4.8 million respectively. Estimated amortization expense of intangible assets over the next five years is estimated to be (dollars in thousands): Fiscal 2022 $ 7,553 Fiscal 2023 7,436 Fiscal 2024 7,388 Fiscal 2025 7,388 Fiscal 2026 7,388 6 . Other Current Liabilities The components of other current liabilities were as follows: (Dollars in thousands) April 3, 2021 March 28, 2020 Customer deposits $ 58,888 $ 22,679 Accrued volume rebates 18,207 17,469 Accrued warranty obligations 24,033 19,179 Accrued compensation and payroll taxes 42,560 27,776 Accrued insurance 12,421 11,182 Other 24,586 15,745 Total other current liabilities $ 180,695 $ 114,030 F-17 7 . Accrued Warranty Obligations Changes in the accrued warranty obligations were as follows: Year Ended (Dollars in thousands) April 3, 2021 March 28, 2020 Balance at the beginning of the period $ 24,969 $ 23,346 Warranty assumed in the acquisition of ScotBilt 1,996 — Warranty expense 37,620 39,434 Cash warranty payments ( 34,116 ) ( 37,811 ) Balance at end of period 30,469 24,969 Less noncurrent portion in other long-term liabilities ( 6,436 ) ( 5,790 ) Total current portion $ 24,033 $ 19,179 8 . Debt and Floor Plan Payable Long-term debt consisted of the following: (Dollars in thousands) April 3, 2021 March 28, 2020 Revolving credit facility maturing in 2023 $ 26,900 $ 64,900 Obligations under industrial revenue bonds due 2029 12,430 12,430 Total debt 39,330 77,330 Less current portion — — Total long-term debt $ 39,330 $ 77,330 On June 5, 2018, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of banks. The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility of up to $ 100.0 million, including a letter of credit sub-facility of not less than $ 45 million. The credit agreement is secured by the assets of certain manufacturing facilities. Initial borrowings under the Credit Agreement were used to repay the Company’s $ 46.9 million term loans and replace the Company’s existing cash collateralized stand-alone letter of credit facility. During fiscal 2021, the Company elected to repay $ 38.0 million of the outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility. The Credit Agreement matures on June 5, 2023 and has no scheduled amortization. The interest rate under the Credit Agreement adjusts based on the first lien net leverage of the Company. From June 5, 2018 through December 31, 2018, the annual interest rate was the selected London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus 1.75 %. Thereafter, the interest rate adjusts based on the first lien net leverage from a high of LIBOR plus 2.25 % and ABR plus 1.25 % when the first lien net leverage is equal to or greater than 2 .00:1.00, to a low of LIBOR plus 1.50 % and ABR plus 0.50 % when the first lien net leverage is below 0.50:1.00. In addition, the Company is obligated to pay an unused line fee ranging between 0.25 % and 0.40 % (depending on the first lien net leverage) in respect of unused commitments under the Credit Agreement. At April 3, 2021 the interest rate on borrowings under the Credit Agreement was 1.6 % and letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement totaled $ 30.4 million. Total available borrowings under the Credit Agreement as of April 3, 2021 were $ 42.7 million. Obligations under industrial revenue bonds are supported by letters of credit and bear interest based on a municipal bond index rate. The weighted-average interest rate at April 3, 2021, including related costs and fees, was 2.18 %. At March 28, 2020, the weighted-average interest rate, including related costs and fees, was 6.31 %. The industrial revenue bonds require lump-sum payments of principal upon maturity in 2029 and are secured by the assets of certain manufacturing facilities. The Credit Agreement contains covenants that restrict the amount of additional debt, liens and certain payments, including equity buybacks, investments, dispositions, mergers and consolidations, among other restrictions as defined. The Company was in compliance with all covenants of the Credit Agreement as of April 3, 2021. Floor Plan Payable The Company’s retail operations utilize floor plan financing to fund the acquisition of manufactured homes for display or resale. At April 3, 2021 and March 28, 2020, the Company had outstanding borrowings on floor plan financing agreements of $ 25.7 million and $ 33.9 million, respectively. The financing arrangements allow for borrowings up to $ 50.0 million. Borrowings are secured by the homes and are required to be repaid when the Company sells the home to a customer. F-18 9 . Revenue Recognition The Company’s revenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of a contract are satisfied which generally occurs with the transfer of control of products. The Company enters into contracts with its customers to provide manufactured homes, modular homes, park model RVs, ADUs, commercial structures and transportation services. Generally, the Company’s contracts may be terminated by the Company’s customers at any time prior to initiation of construction of the respective home. Historically, terminations of these contracts have been minimal. The Company receives signed sales quotes from its customers, which provide the terms for a specific home, including price. The Company also has agreements with certain customers that provide for certain variable consideration, such as volume discounts, that are deducted from the contract price and accrued at the time of sale. In certain situations, the Company may receive payment in advance of completion of its contractual obligations. In these situations, the arising contract liability is classified within customer deposits and receipts in excess of revenues. Following the receipt of the customer deposit, the Company typically completes its performance obligation within a twelve-month period. For sales to independent retailers and builders/developers, revenue is recognized at the point in time when wholesale floor plan financing or retailer credit approval has been received, the home has shipped and title has transferred, which occurs when the Company has satisfied its contractual obligations and the control of its products has been transferred. The Company does not have an enforceable right to payment prior to shipment. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration that the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those products. The Company’s customers pay for products received in accordance with payment terms that are customary within the industry. As is customary in the factory-built housing industry, a significant portion of the Company’s sales to independent retailers are financed under floor plan financing programs with certain third-party lenders. Floor plan financing arrangements are generally identified prior to shipment of products and payment for sales financed under floor plan programs is generally received 5 to 10 business days from the date of invoice. For retail sales to consumers from Company-owned retail sales centers, revenue is recognized when the home has been delivered, set up and accepted by the consumer, and title has transferred. The Company recognizes commercial revenue and related cost of sales for long-term construction contracts (“Commercial”) over time as performance obligations are satisfied using the percentage-of-completion method (input method). Management estimates the stage of completion on each construction project based on progress and costs incurred. Unbilled revenue on long-term construction contracts are classified as a contract asset in accounts receivable. Receipts in excess of billings are classified as contract liabilities and included in other current liabilities. At April 3, 2021 and March 28, 2020, uncollected billings related to long-term construction contracts totaled $ 5.5 million and $ 1.0 million, respectively. There was no unbilled revenue for long-term contracts at April 3, 2021 or March 28, 2020. Revenue for the Company’s transportation operations is recognized when a shipment has been delivered to its final destination. Amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling costs are included in net sales. Shipping and handling costs are accounted for as fulfillment costs and are included in cost of sales.

The FASB Staff Q&A, Topic 740 No. 5, Accounting for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income , states that an entity can make an accounting election to either recognize deferred taxes for temporary differences expected to reverse as GILTI in future years or provide for the tax expense related to GILTI in the year the tax is incurred. The Company has elected to recognize the tax on GILTI as a period expense in the period the tax is incurred. The U.S. income tax rate for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019 is 21 %. F-22 Deferred tax assets and liabilities at April 3, 2021 and March 28, 2020 consisted of the following: (Dollars in thousands) April 3, 2021 March 28, 2020 ASSETS Intangible assets $ 10,665 $ 9,665 Employee compensation 7,500 5,665 Warranty reserves 7,041 6,175 Foreign net operating loss carryforwards 6,250 5,400 U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards 4,583 9,368 Self-insurance reserves 4,058 3,806 Lease assets 2,879 3,684 State net operating loss carryforwards 2,372 2,793 U.S. tax credit carryforwards 2,030 2,030 Dealer volume discounts 1,631 1,216 Inventory reserves and impairments 1,558 1,656 Equity-based compensation 1,333 1,156 Capitalized transaction costs 377 456 Foreign capital loss carryforwards 187 168 Outside basis difference in domestic partnership investment - 2,229 Foreign currency translation adjustments - 67 Other 1,282 1,130 Gross deferred tax assets $ 53,746 $ 56,664 LIABILITIES Intangible assets $ 9,470 $ 10,711 Property, plant, and equipment 8,213 8,411 Foreign tax basis difference in investments 4,280 3,264 Lease liabilities 2,879 3,684 Other 718 837 Gross deferred tax liabilities $ 25,560 $ 26,907 Valuation allowance ( 12,552 ) ( 11,209 ) Net deferred tax assets $ 15,634 $ 18,548 The Company anticipates periodically repatriating the earnings of its Netherlands and Canadian subsidiaries. A deferred tax liability is recognized for income tax withholding which may be incurred upon the reversal of basis differences in investments in its foreign subsidiaries. The Company periodically evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets based on whether it is “more likely than not” that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Our evaluation considers available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit use of the existing deferred tax assets. Due to the Exchange on June 1, 2018, the Company has U.S. federal and state net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards that were generated by the pre-Exchange Skyline entities. The Company’s valuation allowance principally consists of valuation allowances for certain state NOL carryforwards, certain Canadian deferred tax assets, and the Company’s deferred tax assets in the Netherlands. As of April 3, 2021, the Company has U.S. federal NOL carryforwards of $ 21.8 million, which expire in 2032 through 2035 . The Company also has state NOL carryforwards in various jurisdictions which expire primarily in 2021 through 2041 . F-23 Unrecognized tax benefits represent the differences between tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return and the benefits recognized for financial statement purposes. There were no unrecognized tax benefits at April 3, 2021 or March 28, 2020. The Company classifies interest and penalties on income tax uncertainties as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and penalties as of April 3, 2021 and March 28, 2020, were not significant. The following table provides the changes in unrecognized tax benefits for fiscal 2021 and 2020: (Dollars in thousands) April 3, 2021 March 28, 2020 Unrecognized tax benefits, beginning of period $ — $ 643 Increase related to tax positions taken during a prior period — — Reductions as a result of a lapse of the applicable statute of limitations — ( 643 ) Unrecognized tax benefits, end of period $ — $ — The Company estimates no material changes to uncertain tax benefits in the next twelve months. T he Company is no longer subject to foreign tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to fiscal 2017. The Company’s U.S. subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal tax examinations for fiscal 2018 through fiscal 2021, and U.S. state tax examinations by tax authorities for fiscal 2017 through fiscal 2021. 1 2 . Equity-Based Compensation The Company has equity incentive plans under which the Company has been authorized to grant share-based awards to key employees and non-employee directors. Equity-based compensation expense of $ 6.0 million, $ 8.3 million, and $ 102.0 million was recognized in fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Included in equity-based compensation in fiscal 2019 is $ 6.0 million of expense related to former Skyline employees that vested in conjunction with the Exchange. Equity-based compensation expense was included in SG&A expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. The total associated income tax benefit recognized was $ 1.0 million, $ 1.3 million, $ 0.2 million in fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019 respectively. Total unrecognized equity-based compensation for all share-based payment plans was $ 10.1 million at April 3, 2021, of which $ 5.3 million is expected to be recognized in fiscal 2022, $ 3.5 million in fiscal 2023 and $ 1.3 million thereafter, or a weighted-average period of 1.17 years. F-24 Time-Vesting and Performance-Vesting Restricted Share Awards Champion Holdings granted awards to its officers, management employees, and certain members of the Board of Managers under an equity-classified management incentive plan (the “MIP”). In accordance with the provisions of the MIP, as modified on June 1, 2018, unvested units Champion Holdings granted under the MIP were exchanged for unregistered, time-vesting restricted shares and performance-vesting restricted shares of the Company subject to stock restriction agreements (the “SRAs”). The exchange was accounted for as a modification. During fiscal 2019, a significant portion of the performance-vesting restricted shares vested in conjunction with certain follow-on public offerings. The incremental fair value of the modification of the awards was $ 95.1 million and was recognized as expense in fiscal 2019 as all vesting conditions were met during the period. The fair value of the awards that vested during fiscal both 2021 and 2020 was $ 4.2 million. A summary of the activity associated with these awards is as follows: (amounts in thousands) Management Incentive Plan Award Units Time Based Restricted Share Awards Performance Based Restricted Share Awards Outstanding at March 31, 2018 12,655 — — Granted 1,000 — — Exchange of MIP awards for restricted share awards ( 13,655 ) 290 3,686 Vested — — ( 3,686 ) Outstanding at March 30, 2019 — 290 — Vested — ( 145 ) — Outstanding at March 28, 2020 — 145 — Vested — ( 145 ) — Outstanding at April 3, 2021 — — — On September 26, 2018, the Company’s shareholders approved the Company’s 2018 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Equity Plan”) which provides for grants of options, stock appreciation rights, restricted and unrestricted stock and stock units, performance awards, and other awards convertible into or otherwise based on shares of the Company’s common stock. Prior to the approval of the Equity Plan, the Company maintained the Skyline Corporation 2015 Stock Incentive Plan, which allowed for the grant of stock options and other equity awards. General terms and methods of valuation for the Company’s share-based awards granted under the Equity Plan are described below. F-25 Stock Options Stock options generally have terms of 10 years, with one-third of each grant vesting each year for three years , and are assigned an exercise price that is equal to or greater than the closing market price of a share of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. When determining expected volatility, the Company considered volatility of guideline public companies. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant, based on the options’ expected term. The expected term of the options is based on the time period to exercise for each vesting tranche, which is calculated based on the average of: (i) the full option contractual term; and (ii) the starting vest date. A summary of the activity associated with these awards is as follows: Shares (in thousands) Weighted Average Exercise Price Per Share Weighted Average Remaining Term (in years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value (in thousands) Outstanding at March 31, 2018 — Granted 146 $ 15.00 Outstanding at March 30, 2019 146 $ 15.00 Granted 266 $ 32.11 Exercised ( 8 ) $ 15.00 Forfeitures ( 1 ) $ 15.00 Outstanding at March 28, 2020 403 $ 26.29 Granted 138 $ 31.21 Exercised ( 5 ) $ 32.04 Outstanding at April 3, 2021 536 $ 27.50 8.7 $ 10,680 Vested and expected to vest at April 3, 2021 536 $ 27.50 8.7 $ 10,680 Exercisable at April 3, 2021 199 $ 22.64 8.2 $ 4,921 The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model along with the weighted average grant date fair value for awards granted in the periods presented are as follows: Option Award Assumptions Fiscal 2021 Fiscal 2020 Fiscal 2019 Weighted-average assumptions used: Expected volatility 45.0 % 30.0 % 25.8 % Dividend yield — — — Risk-free interest rate 0.5 % 1.7 % 2.4 % Expected term, in years 6.00 5.88 5.75 Weighted average grant date fair value per share $ 12.48 $ 10.33 $ 3.93 F-26 Performance Share Units In fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company issued performance share units that contain market vesting conditions and service conditions. The market condition is based on the Company’s total shareholder return (“TSR”) compared to the median TSR of certain companies over a three year performance period. The Company used a Monte-Carlo simulation to determine the grant date fair value for these awards, which takes into consideration the possible outcomes pertaining to the TSR market condition. Per the terms of the awards, 0 % to 150 % of the Company’s performance share units vest on the third anniversary of the vesting commencement date based upon achievement of the market condition as specified in the performance share unit agreement. A summary of the activity associated with these awards is as follows: Shares (in thousands) Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Per Unit Outstanding at March 31, 2018 — Granted 146 $ 3.62 Outstanding at March 30, 2019 146 $ 3.62 Granted 86 $ 29.05 Forfeitures ( 2 ) $ 3.62 Outstanding at March 28, 2020 230 $ 13.85 Granted 61 $ 28.38 Outstanding at April 3, 2021 291 $ 16.90 The assumptions used in the Monte-Carlo simulation for performance share units along with the weighted-average grant date fair value for awards granted in the periods presented are as follows: Performance Unit Assumptions Fiscal 2021 Fiscal 2020 Fiscal 2019 Weighted-average assumptions used: Expected volatility 50.0 % 30.0 % 29.5 % Dividend yield — — — Risk-free interest rate 0.2 % 1.6 % 2.4 % Expected term, in years 3.00 2.84 2.49 Weighted average grant date fair value per share $ 28.38 $ 29.05 $ 3.62 Restricted Stock Units and Restricted Share Awards Restricted stock units and restricted share awards are valued at the market price of a share of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. In general, these awards have graded vesting conditions in which a portion of awards vest ratably in three equal installments on the anniversary of the vesting commencement date. The total fair value of restricted stock which vested was approximately $ 2.5 million, $ 2.1 million, and $ 8.5 million during fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. The weighted average grant date fair value for restricted stock units granted in fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019 was $ 28.33 , $ 31.34 , and $ 14.24 , respectively. The weighted average grant date fair value for restricted share awards granted in fiscal 2019 was $ 29.77 .

Earnings Per Share Basic net income (loss) per share (“EPS”) attributable to the Company was computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to the Company by the average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The Company’s time-vesting and performance-vesting restricted share awards are considered participating securities. Diluted earnings per common share is computed based on the more dilutive of: (i) the two-class method, assuming the participating securities are not exercised or converted; or (ii) the summation of average common shares outstanding and additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential common shares had been issued. During fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, the two-class method was more dilutive. The number of shares used to calculate earnings per share prior to the Exchange was determined based on the exchange ratio, as defined in the Exchange Agreement. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share: Year Ended (Dollars and shares in thousands, except per share data) April 3, 2021 March 28, 2020 March 30, 2019 Numerator: Net income (loss) $ 84,899 $ 58,160 $ ( 58,208 ) Undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities ( 77 ) ( 170 ) — Net income (loss) attributable to the Company's common shareholders $ 84,822 $ 57,990 $ ( 58,208 ) Denominator: Basic weighted average shares outstanding 56,648 56,516 53,491 Dilutive securities 325 246 — Diluted weighted average shares outstanding 56,973 56,762 53,491 Basic net income (loss) per share: $ 1.50 $ 1.03 $ ( 1.09 ) Diluted net income (loss) per share: $ 1.49 $ 1.02 $ ( 1.09 ) Securities that could potentially dilute basic EPS in the future that were considered antidilutive in the periods presented are shown below: Type of security (in thousands) April 3, 2021 March 28, 2020 Options $ 62 $ 53 Restricted Share Units 81 60 Performance Share Units 182 133 Total dilutive securities $ 325 $ 246 1 4 . Retirement Plans The Company’s U.S. subsidiary sponsors a defined contribution savings plan covering most U.S. employees. Full-time employees covered by the plan are eligible to participate. Participating employees may contribute from 1 % to 25 % of their compensation to the plan, with the Company matching 50 % of the first 6 % of pay contributed. The Company match vests after three years of employment or immediately for employees age 50 and over. The Company recognized expense of $ 2.6 million, $ 2.4 million, and $ 0.6 million related to this plan during fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Full-time employees of the Company’s subsidiaries in Canada are generally covered by employer-sponsored defined contribution plans that require employee contributions and employer matching contributions. The Company recognized expense of $ 0.5 million in fiscal 2021 and $ 0.6 million in both fiscal 2020 and 2019. F-28 1 5 . Transactions with Related Parties Prior to the Exchange, the Company was party to a Management Advisory Services Agreement (“Services Agreement”) with Centerbridge Advisors, LLC (“Centerbridge”), MAK Management L.P.(“MAK”), and Sankaty Advisors, LLC (“Bain”), collectively, the “Managers”, affiliates of which collectively owned a majority of the units of the Company and the Company’s common stock (the “Principal Shareholders”), whereby the Principal Shareholders provided management, consulting, financial and other advisory services to the Company in exchange for an annual management fee totaling $ 1.5 million plus reimbursable expenses. Management fee expense during fiscal 2019, recognized prior to the Exchange, was $ 0.3 million. The Service Agreement was terminated in connection with the Exchange. Management fee expense is included in SG&A expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. On June 1, 2018, the Company, the Principal Shareholders, Champion Holdings, and certain other parties entered into a registration rights agreement providing for, among other things, customary demand registration rights, shelf registration rights and “piggyback” registration rights in favor of the Principal Shareholders and Arthur J. Decio. The Company registered shares for its own account and registered for sale shares held by the Principal Shareholders and others. As the result of a sale of shares by the Principal Shareholders on September 25, 2018, the Principal Shareholders held less than 50 % of the Company’s outstanding shares. Two of the Principal Shareholders, Bain and Centerbridge, have sold all of their shares in the Company. The Company did not sell any shares. MAK continues to hold registration rights in its favor, and their shares are registered for sale. On June 1, 2018 the Company, the Principal Shareholders and Champion Holdings entered into an investor rights agreement (the “Investor Rights Agreement”). The Investor Rights Agreement provides for, among other things, certain information rights and certain agreements relating to the composition of the Board of Directors. As the result of Bain and Centerbridge selling their holdings in the Company, they no longer meet the ownership thresholds to participate in the Investor Rights Agreement. Additionally, the Company and Champion Holdings entered into a transition services agreement, pursuant to which the Company provided certain services to Champion Holdings, including accounting and financial reporting services, tax services, cash and capital management services, and services relating to Champion Holdings’ members and liquidation. 1 6 . Segment Information Financial results for the Company's reportable segments have been prepared using a management approach, which is consistent with the basis and manner in which financial information is evaluated by the Company's chief operating decision maker in allocating resources and in assessing performance. The Company’s chief operating decision maker, the Chief Executive Officer, evaluates the performance of the Company’s segment primarily based on net sales, before elimination of inter-company shipments, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) and operating assets. The Company operates in two reportable segments: (i) U.S. Factory-built Housing, which includes manufacturing and retail housing operations and (ii) Canadian Factory-built Housing. Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation operations, corporate costs directly incurred for all segments and intersegment eliminations. Segments are generally determined by geography. Segment data includes intersegment revenues and corporate office costs that are directly and exclusively incurred for each segment. Total assets for Corporate/Other primarily include cash and certain deferred tax items not specifically allocated to another segment. F-29 Selected financial information by reportable segment was as follows: Year Ended (Dollars in thousands) April 3, 2021 March 28, 2020 March 30, 2019 Net sales: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 1,266,308 $ 1,226,393 $ 1,177,687 Canadian Factory-built Housing 101,328 84,196 98,567 Corporate/Other 53,245 59,141 83,789 Consolidated net sales $ 1,420,881 $ 1,369,730 $ 1,360,043 Operating income: U.S. Factory-built Housing EBITDA $ 142,699 $ 131,339 $ 111,857 Canadian Factory-built Housing EBITDA 19,564 9,272 10,417 Corporate/Other EBITDA ( 29,911 ) ( 35,610 ) ( 135,937 ) Other income ( 5,889 ) — — Depreciation ( 12,087 ) ( 13,116 ) ( 11,259 ) Amortization ( 5,617 ) ( 5,430 ) ( 4,820 ) Consolidated operating income (loss) $ 108,759 $ 86,455 $ ( 29,742 ) Depreciation: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 9,620 $ 11,015 $ 9,507 Canadian Factory-built Housing 860 1,073 933 Corporate/Other 1,607 1,028 819 Consolidated depreciation $ 12,087 $ 13,116 $ 11,259 Amortization of intangible assets: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 5,617 $ 5,430 $ 4,587 Canadian Factory-built Housing — — 233 Corporate/Other — — — Consolidated amortization of intangible assets $ 5,617 $ 5,430 $ 4,820 Capital expenditures: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 6,261 $ 11,753 $ 9,494 Canadian Factory-built Housing 1,034 1,566 879 Corporate/Other 721 2,070 1,719 Consolidated capital expenditures $ 8,016 $ 15,389 $ 12,092 (Dollars in thousands) April 3, 2021 March 28, 2020 Total Assets: U.S. Factory-built Housing (1) $ 578,897 $ 491,110 Canadian Factory-built Housing (1) 87,224 56,760 Corporate/Other (1) 251,781 233,830 Consolidated total assets $ 917,902 $ 781,700 (1) Deferred tax assets for the Canadian operations are reflected in the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment. U.S. deferred tax assets are presented in Corporate/Other because an allocation between segments is not practicable. F-30 1 7 . Commitments, Contingencies, and Concentrations Repurchase Contingencies and Guarantees The Company is contingently liable under terms of repurchase agreements with lending institutions that provide wholesale floor plan financing to retailers. These arrangements, which are customary in the manufactured housing industry, provide for the repurchase of products sold to retailers in the event of default by the retailer on their agreement to pay the financial institution. The risk of loss from these agreements is significantly reduced by the potential resale value of any products that are subject to repurchase and is spread over numerous retailers. The repurchase price is generally determined by the original sales price of the product less contractually defined curtailment payments. Based on these repurchase agreements and our historical loss experience, we establish an associated loss reserve which was $ 1.4 million and $ 1.0 million at April 3, 2021 and March 28, 2020, respectively. Excluding the resale value of the homes, the contingent repurchase obligation as of April 3, 2020 was estimated to be approximately $ 219.5 million. Losses incurred on homes repurchased were immaterial during each of the fiscal years ended April 3, 2021, March 28, 2020, and March 30, 2019. At April 3, 2021, the Company was contingently obligated for approximately $ 30.4 million under letters of credit, primarily consisting of $ 12.6 million to support long-term debt, $ 17.5 million to support the casualty insurance program, and $ 0.3 million to support bonding agreements. The letters of credit are issued under a sub-facility of the Credit Agreement. The Company was also contingently obligated for $ 34.4 million under surety bonds, which generally support performance on long-term construction contracts and license and service bonding requirements. In the normal course of business, the Company’s former subsidiaries that operated in the United Kingdom historically provided certain guarantees to two customers. Those guarantees provide contractual liability for proven construction defects up to 12 years from the date of delivery of certain products. The guarantees remain a contingent liability of the Company which declines over time through October 2027. As of the date of this report, the Company expects few, if any, claims to be reported under the terms of the guarantees. Legal Proceedings The Company has agreed to indemnify counterparties in the ordinary course of its business in agreements to acquire and sell business assets and in financing arrangements. The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of its business. As of the date of this filing, the Company believes the ultimate liability with respect to these contingent obligations will not have, either individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Concentrations The components and products used in the factory-built housing operations are presently available from a variety of vendors, and the Company is not dependent upon any single supplier. Prices of certain materials, such as lumber, insulation, steel and drywall, can fluctuate significantly due to changes in demand and supply. Additionally, availability of certain materials, such as drywall and insulation, has sometimes been limited, resulting in higher prices and/or the need to find alternative suppliers. The Company generally has been able to pass higher material costs on to its customers in the form of surcharges and price increases. For fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, sales from the Company’s Canadian operations were approximately 7 %, 6 %, and 7 %, respectively, of consolidated sales. T he Company’s net assets in Canada totaled approximately $ 87.2 million and $ 45.0 million at April 3, 2021 and March 28, 2020, respectively. The Company has approximately 7,700 employees. The Company’s manufacturing facilities in Canada employ approximately 900 workers, and most of the workers belong to trade associations that operate under collective bargaining agreements. There are five collective bargaining agreements (one for each Canadian manufacturing facility) and each have separate expiration dates. We are operating under an extension and continue to negotiate for one agreement that otherwise would have expired in November 2019 , the remaining agreements are set to expire in May 2021 , June 2021 , June 2022 , and November 2022 .

B USINESS General On June 1, 2018, Skyline Champion Corporation (formerly known as Skyline Corporation), an Indiana corporation, and Champion Enterprises Holdings, LLC (“Champion Holdings”) combined their operations pursuant to the Share Contribution & Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”), dated as of January 5, 2018, by and between Skyline Corporation and Champion Holdings. Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, Champion Holdings contributed to Skyline Corporation all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Champion Holdings’ wholly owned operating subsidiaries, Champion Home Builders, Inc. (“CHB”), and CHB International B.V. (“CIBV”) (the shares of stock of CHB and CIBV contributed to Skyline Corporation, the “Contributed Shares”), and in exchange for the Contributed Shares, Skyline Corporation issued to the members of Champion Holdings, in the aggregate, 47,752,008 shares of Skyline Corporation common stock, $0.0277 par value per share (such issuance, the “Shares Issuance”). The contribution of the Contributed Shares by Champion Holdings to the Corporation, and the Shares Issuance by Skyline Corporation to the members of Champion Holdings are collectively referred to herein as the “Exchange.” The Exchange was treated as a purchase of the Company by Champion Holdings for accounting and financial reporting purposes. As a result, the financial results for all periods presented prior to the Exchange are comprised solely of the results of Champion Holdings. The terms "" Skyline Champion,"" ""us,"" ""we,"" ""our,"" the ""Company,"" and any other similar terms refer to Skyline Champion Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated in this Annual Report. We are the largest independent publicly traded factory-built housing company in North America with net sales for the year ended March 28, 2020 (“fiscal 2020”) of $1.4 billion. We have more than 65 years of homebuilding experience, approximately 6,600 employees and 38 manufacturing facilities located in 18 states across the United States and three provinces in western Canada. We offer a leading portfolio of manufactured and modular homes, park model RVs, and modular buildings for the multi-family, hospitality, senior and workforce housing sectors. Our facilities are strategically located to serve strong markets in the United States and western Canada. We operated 13 manufacturing facilities in the top ten states with the highest number of manufactured homes shipped in fiscal 2020, as well as 16 manufacturing facilities in the ten states with the greatest growth in the number of manufactured homes shipped in the last ten years. We believe that we maintain the following leading positions in the factory-built housing industry in the United States and western Canada (based on units) in calendar year 2019: • Number two position in the manufactured housing market segment in the United States • Number one modular builder in the United States • A leading position in western Canada • A leading position in park model RV sales We believe our market leading positions are driven by our comprehensive product offering, strong brand reputation, broad manufacturing footprint, and our complementary retail and logistics businesses. Our market share in the United States manufactured housing market segment has increased from 8% in the beginning of fiscal 2011 to approximately 17% in fiscal 2020 based on total number of units produced. We design and build a range of manufactured and modular homes, park model RVs, Accessory Dwelling Units (“ADUs”), and commercial structures. We believe that the high quality and broad scope of our product and service offerings provide us a competitive advantage relative to other factory-built and certain site-built homes. With our award-winning product designs, we seek to meet the needs of our localized customers, while also providing them with customizable options. Our leading brands are marketed and distributed through a network of independent and company-owned retailers, community operators, government agencies, and commercial developers. We build homes under some of the most well-known brand names in the factory-built housing industry including Skyline Homes, Champion Home Builders, Genesis Homes, Athens Park Models, Dutch Housing, Excel Homes, Homes of Merit, New Era, Redman Homes, Shore Park, Silvercrest, and Titan Homes in the U.S., and Moduline and SRI Homes in western Canada. In addition to our core home building business, we operate a factory-direct manufactured-home retail business, Titan Factory Direct, with 21 sales centers spanning the southern United States, and Star Fleet Trucking, which provides transportation services to the manufactured housing and other industries from several dispatch locations across the United States. 3 C orporate Information Skyline Champion Corporation was originally incorporated in Indiana as Skyline Corporation. Following the completion of the Exchange, we changed our name to Skyline Champion Corporation. Our principal executive offices are located at 755 West Big Beaver Road, Suite 1000, Troy, MI 48084. Our website is located at www. skylinechampion .com. Our website and the information contained on our website is not incorporated by reference and is not a part of this Annual Report. Business Strategies We intend to continue to pursue opportunities to profitably grow our revenue, as well as improve our operating margins by executing on our strategic initiatives. However, we feel that the COVID-19 pandemic will slow this progress during fiscal 2021 and possibly fiscal 2022, depending on the trajectory of the virus and its impact on the broader U.S. and Canadian economies including consumer confidence, unemployment and other home-buying trends. Our long-term business strategy is to grow our revenue and earnings by constructing quality-built, sustainable, and innovatively designed homes and other modular structures in an environmentally friendly factory setting. Capitalize on Market Trends and Other Key Drivers In recent years, manufactured home construction experienced revenue growth due to a number of favorable demographic trends and demand drivers in the United States, including the need for affordable housing, the underlying growth trends in key homebuyer groups, such as the population over 65 years of age, the population of first-time home buyers, and the population of households earning less than $50,000 per year. More recently, we see a number of market trends pointing to increased sales of ADUs and urban to rural migration as customers accommodate working from home patterns as well as people seeking rent-to-own single-family options. We intend to capitalize on these trends and drivers to grow our business over the medium to long-term. We believe that there is an opportunity for continued manufactured and modular construction market with medium term expansion driven by the foregoing trends and demand drivers, as well as construction labor shortages in certain regions (which tend to adversely and disproportionally impact supply and cost of site-built homes when compared to manufactured housing) and increased affordability of factory-built homes relative to site-built homes. As the U.S. economy recovers to pre-COVID-19 levels, we will seek to capture additional demand from manufactured housing communities that increase spending on expansion and development projects. In addition, if financing availability continues to improve and related regulation continues to ease, we believe that there will be an increase in the number of prospective customers who qualify for home loans for manufactured and modular homes. Finally, we are one of a limited number of manufactured homebuilders who have been approved for contracts with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (“ FEMA”) and have historically provided housing assistance requirements following natural disasters and other housing emergencies. Expand Products and Distribution Channels through Product Innovation We design, produce, market, and transport a range of manufactured and modular homes, park model RVs, ADUs and commercial solutions through a variety of channels. We strive to grow our distribution through enhancing our digital offerings and our relationships with community operators, builder/developers, park model operators, and retailers. Through our newly launched Genesis brand, we are expanding our relationships with developers to meet pent-up demand for standardized homes that can be costed effectively and quickly constructed. We plan to continue to innovate our home designs, home products, and commercial designs to meet the needs of existing and new customers. We have received numerous awards from the Manufactured Housing Institute (“MHI”), the National Association of Home Builders, and others for our leadership in manufactured and modular home designs, craftsmanship and quality. Most recently in calendar year 2020, MHI recognized us as an industry leader with three Excellence in Manufactured and Modular Home Design awards that spanned multiple categories including multi-section, single-section, and modular homes. These awards reflect the unparalleled homes, customer experiences and innovative solutions that we consistently bring to a competitive and dynamic market. We were awarded the Excellence in Home Design for Modular Homes over 4,000 Square Feet as well as recognized for our work on a hotel commercial project by the National Association for Home Builders. We maintain an active dialogue with residential and commercial developers to identify demand trends and anticipate the needs of customers. We also plan to continue to work closely with our suppliers to pilot new products and amenities, such as configurable smart living space ADU designs, in-home smart technologies and luxury interior finishes. 4 Continue to Implement Operational Initiatives to Enhance Margins Longer Term We have been able to expand our operating margins over time as a result of increased volume, Exchange synergies, reduction of our material cost inputs, and company-wide efforts focused on standardization and simplification of our operations. We are currently focused on a number of ongoing operational initiatives to further enhance our long-term operating margins and construction innovation, including: • refining our product floor plan designs and options to offer “designed flexibility” to our customers; • improving our internal processes as well as externally facing systems to enhance the customer’s experience from initial introduction all the way through home ownership; • executing on continuous improvement initiatives related to identified procurement, operational and labor cost saving opportunities as well as streamlining overlapping functions; • enhancing the efficiency and sustainability of our products to the customer through value-adding material substitution; and • focusing on operational excellence and production efficiency through further simplification of our manufacturing process. Among other initiatives, we plan to further develop our national product line under the Genesis brand, continue development of our modular platform, and standardize our engineering and design platform. We have a proven ability to distribute orders efficiently across our manufacturing footprint based on market demand, workforce availability, and our surrounding distribution capabilities. We are standardizing our manufacturing processes and employing metrics-driven accountability measures across all of our facilities to achieve these strategic initiatives. Continue a Balanced Organic and Acquisition-Based Growth Strategy We have demonstrated our ability to broaden our manufacturing and retail presence through the successful execution of a balanced organic growth and acquisition-based strategy. As demand for affordable housing grows and the global economy returns to pre-pandemic volumes, we will continue to execute on this growth strategy. We believe our idle manufacturing plants provide us with the ability to grow with demand over the longer term. We also intend to explore opportunities to acquire value enhancing retail locations, manufacturing facilities, and factory-built housing competitors to supplement our organic growth initiatives. We have a proven track-record of executing and integrating acquisitions. Factory-Built Housing A majority of our manufactured products are constructed in accordance with the regulations and rules of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) and the National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974, as amended (""HUD code""). We produce a broad range of manufactured and modular homes under a variety of brand names and in a variety of floor plans and price ranges. While most of the homes we build are single-family, multi-section, ranch-style homes, we also build two-story, single-section, and Cape Cod style homes as well as multi-family units such as town homes, apartments, duplexes, and triplexes. The single-family homes that we manufacture generally range in size from 400 to 4,000 square feet and typically include two to four bedrooms, a living room or family room, a dining room, a kitchen and typically two full bathrooms. We also build park model RVs for resorts and campgrounds, ADUs for backyard or recreational living, and commercial modular structures, including hotels, and student and workforce housing. We regularly introduce homes with new floor plans, exterior designs and elevations, decors and features. Our corporate marketing and engineering departments work with our manufacturing facilities to design homes that appeal to consumers’ changing tastes at appropriate price points for their respective markets. We design and build homes with a traditional residential or site-built appearance through the use of, among other features, dormers and higher pitched roofs. In fiscal 2020, we introduced our Genesis brand of homes which have features similar to site-built home amenities such as porches and garages, and are eligible for recently launched financing programs with terms similar to traditional mortgages. We also are very active in the design and construction of energy-efficient homes. Many of our U.S. manufacturing facilities are certified to produce “Energy Star®” rated homes through a special EPA program for manufactured housing. The components and products used in factory-built housing are generally of the same quality as those used by other home builders, including conventional site-builders. The primary components include lumber, plywood, OSB, drywall, steel, floor coverings, insulation, exterior siding (vinyl, composites, wood and metal), doors, windows, shingles, kitchen appliances, furnaces, plumbing and electrical fixtures and hardware. These components are presently available from a variety of sources and we are not dependent upon any single supplier. Prices of certain materials such as lumber, insulation, steel and drywall can fluctuate significantly due to changes in demand and supply. Additionally, availability of certain materials such as drywall and insulation have sometimes 5 been limited, resulting in higher prices and/or the need to find alternative suppliers. Typically, a one to three-week supply of raw materials is maintained. We generally have been able to pass higher material costs on to customers in the form of surcharges and price increases. Most completed factory-built homes have cabinets, wall coverings and electrical, heating and plumbing systems. HUD code homes also generally contain factory installed floor coverings, appliances and window treatments. Optional factory installed features include fireplaces, dormers, entertainment centers and skylights. Upon completion of the home at the factory, homes sold to retailers are transported to a retail sales center or directly to the home site. Homes sold to builders and developers are generally transported directly to the home site. At the home site, the home is placed on a foundation or otherwise affixed to the property and readied for occupancy typically by setup contractors. The sections (also referred to as floors) of a multi-section home are joined and the interior and exterior seams are finished at the home site. The consumer purchase of the home may also include retailer or contractor supplied items such as additional appliances, air conditioning, furniture, porches, decks, and garages. We construct homes in indoor facilities using an assembly-line process employing approximately 100 to 200 production employees at each facility. Factory-built HUD code homes are constructed in one or more sections affixed to a steel support frame that allows the sections to be moved through the assembly line and transported upon sale. The sections of many of the modular homes we produce are built on wooden floor systems and transported on carriers that are removed upon placement of the home at the home site. Each section or floor is assembled in stages, beginning with the construction of the frame and the floor, then adding the walls, ceiling and roof assembly, and other constructed and purchased components, and ending with a final quality control inspection. The efficiency of the assembly-line process, protection from the weather, and favorable pricing of materials resulting from our substantial purchasing power enables us to produce homes more quickly and often at a lower cost than a conventional site-built home of similar quality. The production schedules of our homebuilding facilities are based upon customer orders, which can fluctuate from week to week. Orders from retailers are generally subject to cancellation at any time up to the commencement of production without penalty and are not necessarily an indication of future business. Retailers place orders for retail stocking (inventory) purposes and for homebuyer orders. Before scheduling homes for production, orders and availability of financing are confirmed with our customer and, where applicable, their lender. Orders are generally filled within 90 days of receipt, depending upon the level of unfilled orders and requested delivery dates. Because we produce homes to fulfill wholesale orders, our factories generally do not carry finished goods inventories, except for homes awaiting delivery. We manage our production levels, capacity and workforce size based upon current market demands. At March 28, 2020, we had a backlog of home orders with wholesale sales value of approximately $127.5 million. After production of a particular home has commenced, the order becomes noncancelable and the retailer is obligated to take delivery of the home. Although factory-built homes can be produced throughout the year in indoor facilities, demand for homes is usually affected by inclement weather and by the cold winter months in northern areas of the U.S. and in Canada. Charges to transport homes increase with the distance from the factory to the retailer or home site. As a result, most of the retailers and builders/developers we sell to are located within a 500-mile radius of our manufacturing plants. We offer a wide selection of manufactured and modular homes as well as park model RVs at company-owned retail locations marketed under the Titan Factory Direct brand. We maintain our company-owned retail presence through 21 retail sales centers in Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Texas, and Virginia. We have benefited from the strategic expansion of our captive distribution to enhance the reach of our factory-built housing products directly to the homebuyer. Each of our full-service retail sales centers has a sales office and a variety of display model homes of various sizes, floor plans, features, and prices that are displayed in a residential setting with sidewalks and landscaping. Customers may purchase a home from an inventory of homes maintained at the location, including a model home, or may order a home that will be built at a manufacturing facility. The collective benefits of our retail organization provide industry leadership with the expertise to be proactive to local economic conditions and ultimately provide affordable homes to value-conscious homebuyers. During fiscal 2020, the average selling price was $61,000 for our U.S. factory-built homes and $84,000 for our homes sold through our Canadian housing segment. Manufactured home sales prices ranged from $20,000 to over $250,000. Retail sales prices of the homes, without land, generally ranged from $25,000 to over $300,000, depending upon size, floor plan, features, and options. 6 Logistics We operate a logistics business, Star Fleet Trucking, specializing in the transportation of manufactured homes and recreational vehicles from manufacturing facilities to retailers. Star Fleet’s delivery logistics are coordinated through dispatch terminals located in Idaho, Indiana, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, and Texas. Star Fleet has strong relationships with its customer base, which includes some of the largest manufactured housing companies (including our own factory-built housing operations), and recreational vehicle manufacturers in the U.S. Market Overview General. Factory-built housing provides an affordable alternative to other types of housing such as site-built housing and condominiums, and to existing housing such as pre-owned homes and apartments. According to statistics published by the Institute for Building Technology and Safety (""IBTS"") and the United States Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, for the 2019 calendar year, manufactured housing wholesale shipments of homes constructed in accordance with the HUD code accounted for an estimated 10.7% of all new single-family homes starts. According to data reported by MHI, industry home shipments were 97,553; 93,265 and 90,729 units (excluding FEMA units) during fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Industry shipments of HUD-code FEMA units were 112 and 4,315 in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. There were no industry shipments of HUD-coded FEMA units in fiscal 2020 or 2019. Annual shipments have generally increased each year since calendar year 2009 when only 50,000 HUD-coded manufactured homes were shipped, the lowest level since the industry began recording statistics in 1959. While shipments of HUD-coded manufactured homes have improved modestly in recent years, manufactured housing’s most recent annual shipment levels still operate at lower levels than the long-term historical average of over 200,000 units annually. The market for factory-built housing is affected by a number of factors, including the availability, cost and credit underwriting standards of consumer financing, consumer confidence, employment levels, general housing market, interest rates and other economic conditions and the overall affordability of factory-built housing versus other forms of housing. In the past, a number of factors have restricted demand for factory-built housing, including, in some cases, less-favorable financing terms compared to site-built housing, the effects of restrictive zoning on the availability of certain locations for home placement and, in some cases, an unfavorable public image. Certain of these adverse factors have lessened considerably in recent years with the improved quality and appearance of factory-built housing. Home Buyer Demographics. We believe the segment of the housing market in which manufactured housing is most competitive includes consumers with household incomes under $60,000. This segment has a high representation of young single persons and married couples, first time home buyers, and homebuyers age 55 and older. The comparatively low cost of manufactured homes attracts these consumers. People in rural areas, where fewer housing alternatives exist, and those who presently live in factory-built homes, also make up a significant portion of the demand for new factory-built housing. We believe higher-priced, multi-section manufactured and modular homes are attractive to households with higher incomes as an alternative to rental housing and condominiums and are well suited to meet the needs of the retiree buyer in many markets. The two largest manufactured housing consumer demographics, Millennials (generally defined as those born between 1981 – 1996) and Baby Boomers (generally defined as those born between 1946 – 1964), comprise the fastest growing populations. Millennials are generally first-time home buyers who may be attracted by the affordability, and diversity of style choices of factory-built homes. Baby Boomers are similarly interested in the value proposition; however, they are also motivated by the energy efficiency and low maintenance requirements of factory-built homes, and by the lifestyle offered by planned communities that are specifically designed for homeowners that fall into this age group. 7 Financing Commercial Financing. Independent retailers of factory-built homes generally finance their inventory purchases from manufacturers with floor plan financing provided by third-party lending institutions and secured by a lien on the homes. The availability and cost of floor plan financing can affect the amount of retailer new home inventory, the number of retail sales centers and related wholesale demand. Under a typical floor plan financing arrangement, an independent financial institution specializing in this line of business provides the retailer with a loan for the purchase price of the home and maintains a security interest in the home as collateral. The financial institution customarily requires us, as the manufacturer of the home, to enter into a separate repurchase agreement with the financial institution that, upon default by the retailer and under certain other circumstances, obligates us to repurchase the financed home at declining prices over the term of the repurchase agreement (which, in most cases, is 18 to 36 months). The price at which we may be obligated to repurchase a home under these agreements is based upon the amount financed, plus certain administrative and shipping expenses. Our obligation under these repurchase agreements ceases upon the purchase of the home by the retail customer. The maximum amount of our contingent obligations under such repurchase agreements was approximately $152.7 million as of March 28, 2020. The risk of loss under these agreements is spread over many retailers and is further reduced by the resale value of the homes. During fiscal 2020, approximately 32% of our sales to independent retailers were financed under floor plan agreements with national lenders, while the remaining 68% were financed under various arrangements with local or regional banks or paid in cash. We generally receive payment from the lending institution 5 to 10 days after a home is sold and invoiced to an independent retailer. Consumer Financing. Sales of factory-built homes are significantly affected by the availability, credit underwriting standards, and cost of consumer financing. There are three basic types of consumer financing in the factory-built housing industry: 1) conforming mortgage loans which comply with the requirements of the Federal Housing Administration (“FHA”), Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Agriculture or Government-Sponsored Enterprise (“GSE”) loans which include Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac agencies; 2) non-conforming mortgages for purchasers of the home and the land on which the home is placed; and 3) personal property loans (often referred to as home-only or chattel loans) for consumers where the home is the sole collateral for the loan (generally HUD-coded homes). Industry trade associations are working towards favorable legislative and GSE action to address the mortgage financing needs of potential buyers of affordable homes. Many moderate-income families cannot afford to buy a home due to the increasing costs of newly constructed homes and decreasing supply of existing, affordable homes. Federal law required the GSEs to issue a regulation to implement the Duty to Serve (“DTS”) requirements specified in the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992, as amended by the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008. FNMA and FHLMC released their final Underserved Markets Plan that describes, with specificity, the actions they will take over a three-year period to fulfill the DTS obligation. These plans became effective on January 1, 2018. The GSEs have obtained feedback from various stakeholders during their outreach efforts on advancing the underserved markets since the DTS plans became effective in 2018. Their DTS plans continue to evolve based on the feedback received and their current areas of focus are as follows: 1) purchase more loans used to finance manufactured homes titled as real property; 2) enhance current products and create new offerings; and 3) provide consumer education to help borrowers navigate both the real property and personal property markets. The GSEs have rolled out new financing programs specifically for homes built to the HUD code, which include CHOICEHome® from Freddie Mac and MH Advantage® from Fannie Mae. HUD-coded homes manufactured for these programs have features comparable to site-built homes, including, drywall throughout, higher-pitch roof line, energy-efficient features, lower profile foundation, plus additional options such as a garage or carport. These products aim to promote quality manufactured homes as an acceptable alternative to site-built homes and will allow moderate-income families to purchase a manufactured home with lending terms similar to those for site-built homes. The DTS plans also explored the potential for the GSEs to provide liquidity to the chattel lending market, first through a limited pilot and then through an ongoing program. The GSEs could potentially serve as additional source of funding as there is unmet demand in the chattel loan industry, and GSE involvement could increase volume substantially. Freddie Mac has made the decision to suspend activities on pursuing a pilot on manufactured homes titled as personal property and instead allocate resources on pursuing activities including loan purchases of manufactured homes titled as real property. The Fannie Mae DTS plan still includes a provision indicating that they are exploring a pilot to establish a secondary market for chattel or home-only loans. Expansion of the secondary market for home-only lending through the GSEs could provide further demand for housing, as lending options would likely become more available to home buyers. Separate from the GSE involvement in chattel markets, there have been three secondary market chattel private placement offerings in the last twelve months. Although some limited progress has been made in this area, a meaningful positive impact in the form of increased home orders has yet to be realized. 8 Competition The factory-built housing industry is highly competitive at both the manufacturing and retail levels, with competition based upon several factors, including price, product features, reputation for service and quality, depth of distribution, and retail customer financing. Capital requirements for entry into the industry are relatively low. According to MHI, in March 2020, there were 33 producers of manufactured homes in the U.S. operating an estimated 136 production facilities. For calendar year 2019, the top 3 companies had a combined market share of HUD code homes of approximately 76%, according to data published by MHI. We estimate that there were approximately 4,000 industry retail locations throughout the U.S. during calendar year 2019. Based on industry data reported by IBTS, in fiscal 2020 our U.S. wholesale market share of HUD code homes sold was 16.5%, compared to 16.6% in fiscal 2019. We compete with the 32 other producers of manufactured homes, as well as companies offering for sale homes repossessed from wholesalers or consumers. In addition, manufactured homes compete with new and existing site-built homes, as well as apartments, townhouses, and condominiums. There are a number of other national manufacturers competing for a significant share of the manufactured housing market in the U.S., including Clayton Homes, Inc. and Cavco Industries. Certain of these competitors may possess greater financial, manufacturing, distribution, and marketing resources. Government Regulation Our manufactured homes are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws, codes and regulations. The majority of our homes are built to comply with the HUD code which include regulations that cover all aspects of manufactured home construction and installation, including structural integrity, fire safety, wind loads, thermal protection and ventilation. To the extent state and local regulations conflict with the HUD code, they are pre-empted. Our modular homes and commercial structures are built to comply with applicable state and local building codes. Our park model RVs are built in conformance with the applicable standards approved by the American National Standards Institute, a private, non-profit organization that administers and coordinates voluntary standards and conformity programs. A variety of laws affect the financing of the homes we manufacture. The Federal Consumer Credit Protection Act and Regulation Z promulgated thereunder require written disclosure of information relating to such financing, including the amount of the annual percentage interest rate and the finance charge. A variety of state laws also regulate the form of financing documents and the allowable deposits, finance charge and fees charged. Federal laws permit manufactured housing retailers to assist home buyers with securing financing for the purchase of homes; however, they are prohibited from negotiating the financing terms. Governmental authorities enforcing these numerous laws and regulations can impose fines and/or seek injunctive relief for violations. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with the requirements of these applicable laws and regulations. Seasonality The housing industry is subject to seasonal fluctuations based on home buyer purchasing patterns. We typically experience decreased home buyer traffic during holidays and popular vacation periods. Demand for our core single-family new home products typically peaks each spring and summer before declining in the winter, consistent with the overall housing industry, although this pattern was partially interrupted during the winter of fiscal 2018, when we produced a limited number of disaster-relief homes for FEMA. The U.S. has experienced extreme weather events over the past few years resulting in widespread property damage. It has been widely reported that the overall economic toll in the affected market areas that have experienced severe weather events is substantial. There has been somewhat increased consumer demand for replacement of homes lost as a result of these events. This may include demand for additional disaster-relief manufactured home orders from federal and state agencies. We have produced disaster-relief homes for FEMA previously. These homes were built in factories located in unaffected regions of the country, primarily during the winter months, which lessened disruptions to existing order demand from our core customer base. 9 Employees We have approximately 6,600 employees. We deem our relationship with our employees to be generally good. Currently, our manufacturing facilities in Canada employ approximately 700 workers, and most of the workers belong to trade associations that operate under collective bargaining agreements. There are five collective bargaining agreements (one for each Canadian plant) and each have separate expiration dates. One agreement expired in November 2019 and is still under renegotiation, two agreements are set to expire in June 2020, one agreement is set to expire in November 2021, and one agreement is set to expire in November 2022. Available Information Our website address is www.skylinechampion.com and we make available, free of charge, on or through our website all of our periodic reports, including our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K, as soon as reasonably practicable after we file such reports with the SEC. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Our business involves a number of risks and uncertainties. You should carefully consider the following risks, together with the information provided elsewhere in this Annual Report. The items described below are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks that are currently unknown to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial may also impair our business or adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and is expected to continue to have, significant adverse effects on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and business. The global outbreak of COVID-19 has caused a material adverse effect on the level of economic activity around the world, including in all of the markets that we serve. In response to this outbreak, the governments of many countries, states, cities and regions have taken preventative or protective actions, such as imposing restrictions on travel and business operations. We have implemented numerous measures attempting to manage and mitigate the effects of the virus on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and business, but there can be no assurance that these measures will succeed. We cannot predict the degree to which, or the time period over which, our sales and operations will be affected by this outbreak and the preventative measures. The effects could be highly material. The COVID-19 pandemic poses many risks, including that we or our employees, suppliers, customers and others may be restricted or prevented from conducting business activities for indefinite or intermittent periods of time, including as a result of employee health and safety concerns, shutdowns, shelter-in-place or stay-at-home orders, travel restrictions, and other actions and restrictions that may be requested or mandated by governmental authorities. Beginning in March 2020, we experienced the temporary shutdown of several of our facilities in the U.S. and Canada. Certain government orders related to COVID-19 mitigation efforts may further restrict our ability to operate our business and may impact our financial condition and results of operations. Finally, while certain facilities are considered essential and can remain in operation during the COVID-19 pandemic, there can be no assurance that these facilities will continue to be classified as essential in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate and will remain in operation. In addition, many of our facilities that remain in operation are not utilized as fully as they were before the COVID-19 pandemic. Underutilization of facilities could increase if and as the pandemic persists and spreads further. Further, we have experienced, and may continue to experience, disruptions or delays in our supply chain as a result of such actions. This is likely to result in higher supply chain costs to us, incurred in order to maintain the supply of component parts needed to produce our products. Our management of the impacts of COVID-19 has required, and will continue to require, significant investment of time by our management and employees. The focus on managing and mitigating the impacts of COVID-19 on our business may cause us to divert or delay the application of our resources toward other or new initiatives or investments, which in turn may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. We may also experience impacts from market downturns and changes in consumer behavior including uncertainty in consumer confidence, increasing unemployment, and reductions in discretionary spending related to pandemic fears as a result of COVID-19. The consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic include widespread unemployment and uncertainty, among other problems, reducing the likelihood of people seeking new or improved housing. Further, the impacts of COVID-19 have caused significant uncertainty and volatility in the credit markets. We rely on the credit markets to provide us with liquidity to operate and grow our businesses beyond the liquidity that operating cash flows provide. If our access to capital were to become significantly constrained, or if costs of capital were to increase significantly due to the impact of COVID-19, then our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and business, could be materially adversely affected. 10 The extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak continues to impact us will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new government actions or restrictions, new information that may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19, the longevity of COVID-19 and the impact of COVID-19 on economic activity. T he COVID-19 pandemic also may have the effect of significantly heightening other risks associated with our business and our financial condition, including several of the risks disclosed below . The factory-built housing industry is cyclical, is affected by seasonality and is sensitive to changes in general economic or other business conditions. The factory-built housing industry is affected by seasonality. Sales during the period from March to November are typically higher than in other months. As a result, our sales and operating results sometimes fluctuate and may continue to fluctuate in the future. The factory-built housing industry is also sensitive to changes in economic conditions and other factors, such as pandemics, employment rates, job growth, population growth, consumer confidence, consumer income, availability of financing, interest rate levels, and an oversupply of homes for sale. Changes in any of these conditions generally, or in the markets where we operate, could reduce demand and constrain pricing for new factory-built homes in these areas or result in customer cancellations of pending shipments. Reductions in the number of homes shipped by us or constraints on the prices we can charge, could result in a decrease in our net sales and earnings, which could adversely affect our financial condition. We are subject to demand fluctuations in the housing industry. Reductions in demand could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Demand for our homes is subject to fluctuations in the housing market generally. In a housing market downturn, our sales and results of operations could be adversely affected; there might be significant inventory impairments and other write-offs; our gross margins could decline significantly from historical levels; and we might incur losses from operations. We cannot predict the future demand for housing. If it were to decline significantly, our financial condition could be adversely affected. Future increases in interest rates, more stringent credit standards, tightening of financing terms, or other increases in the effective costs of owning a factory-built home (including those related to regulation or other government actions) could limit the purchasing power of our potential customers and could adversely affect our business and financial results. A large majority of our customers finance their home purchases through third-party lenders. Interest rates have been near historical lows for several years, which has made purchasing new factory-built homes more affordable. Increases in interest rates or decreases in the availability of consumer financing could adversely affect the market for homes. Potential customers may be less willing or able to pay the increased monthly costs or to obtain financing. Lenders may increase the qualifications needed for financing or adjust their terms to address any increased credit risk. These factors could adversely affect the sales or pricing of our factory-built homes. These developments have historically had, and may once again have, an adverse effect on the overall demand for factory-built housing and its competitiveness with other forms of housing, and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. The liquidity provided by the GSEs and the FHA is also critical in insuring or purchasing home mortgages and creating or insuring investment securities that are either sold to investors or held in their portfolios. Any limitations or restrictions on the availability of financing by these agencies could adversely affect interest rates, financing, and our sales of new homes. The availability of wholesale financing for retailers is limited due to a limited number of floor plan lenders and reduced lending limits. Factory-built housing retailers generally finance their inventory purchases with wholesale floor plan financing provided by lending institutions. The availability of wholesale financing is significantly affected by the number of floor plan lenders and their lending limits. Limited availability of floor plan lending negatively affects the inventory levels of our independent retailers, the number of retail sales center locations and related wholesale demand, and adversely affects the availability of and access to capital on an ongoing basis. As a result, if the availability of wholesale financing is reduced, we could experience sales declines or a higher level of customer defaults and its operating results and cash flows could suffer. We have contingent repurchase obligations related to wholesale financing provided to industry retailers. As is customary in the factory-built housing industry, a significant portion of our manufacturing sales to independent retailers are financed under floor plan agreements with financing companies. In connection with the floor plan financing programs, we generally have separate agreements with the financing companies that require us to repurchase homes upon default by the retailer and 11 repossession of the homes by the financing companies. The impact of COVID-19 may have an adverse impact on the solvency of independent industry retailers, and as a result, we may be required to honor the contingent repurchase agreements if the retailers default under terms of the floor plan financing arrangements. These repurchase agreements are applicable for various periods of time, generally up to 24 months after the sale of the home to the retailer. However, certain homes are subject to repurchase until the home is sold by the retailer. Our contingent repurchase obligation as of March 28, 2020 , was estimated to be approximately $ 152.7 million, without reduction for the resale value of the homes. We may be required to honor contingent repurchase obligations in the future and may incur additional expense and reduced cash flows because of these repurchase agreements. If we are unable to establish or maintain relationships with independent distributors that sell our homes, our sales could decline and our results of operations and cash flows could suffer. Although we maintain our own factory direct retail business in select markets, we conduct a majority of our business through independent distributors. Over 90% of our shipments of homes in fiscal 2020 were made to independent distributors throughout the United States and western Canada. We may not be able to establish relationships with new independent distributors or maintain good relationships with independent distributors that sell our homes. Even if we establish and maintain relationships with independent distributors, these customers are not obligated to sell our homes exclusively and may choose to sell competitors’ homes instead. The independent distributors with whom we have relationships can cancel these relationships on short notice. In addition, these customers may not remain financially solvent, as they are subject to industry, economic, demographic, and seasonal trends similar to those faced by us. If we do not establish and maintain relationships with solvent independent distributors in the markets we serve, sales in those markets could decline, and if we cannot effect offsetting expansion of our factory-direct retail business, our results of operations and cash flows could suffer. Prices of certain materials can fluctuate and availability of certain materials may be limited at times, adversely affecting our business. Prices of certain materials used in the construction of homes, such as lumber, insulation, steel, drywall, oil-based products and fuel, can fluctuate significantly due to changes in demand and supply, adversely affecting our business. Additionally, availability of certain materials such as drywall and insulation may be limited at times, resulting in higher prices or the need to find alternative suppliers. We may attempt to pass the higher material costs on to customers, but it is not certain that we will be able to achieve this without adversely affecting demand. Limited availability of materials may also adversely affect our production capabilities and results of operations. For some of the components used in production, we depend on a small group of suppliers, the loss of any of which could adversely affect our ability to obtain components in a timely manner or at competitive prices, which would in turn decrease our sales and profit margins. Some components are sourced from foreign sources. Delays in obtaining these components or the imposition of new or additional tariffs could result in increased costs and decreased sales and profit margins. We depend on timely and sufficient delivery of components from our suppliers. Most components are readily available from a variety of sources. However, a few key components are currently produced by only a small group of quality suppliers that have the capacity to supply large quantities. Some of these components are foreign-sourced. Their supply is subject to disruption by government actions and global events, including the COVID-19 pandemic. If we cannot obtain an adequate supply of these key components our sales could decline and our results of operations and cash flows could suffer. Our results of operations can be adversely affected by labor shortages and turnover. The homebuilding industry has from time to time experienced labor shortages and other labor-related issues. A number of factors may adversely affect the labor force available to us and our subcontractors in one or more of our markets, including high employment levels, construction market conditions, and government regulation, which include laws and regulations related to workers’ health and safety, wage and hour practices, and immigration. Our direct labor has historically experienced high turnover rates, which can lead to increased spending on training and retention and, as a result, increased costs of production. An overall labor shortage or a lack of skilled labor could cause significant increases in costs or delays in construction of homes, which could have a material adverse effects on our net sales and results of operations. Industry conditions and future operating results could limit our sources of capital. If we are unable to locate suitable sources of capital when needed, we may be unable to maintain or expand our business. We depend on our cash balances, cash flows from operations, and our revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) to finance our operating requirements, capital expenditures, and other needs. If our cash balances, cash flows from operations, and availability 12 under the Credit Facility are insufficient to finance our operations and alternative capital is not available, then we may not be able to expand our business and make acquisitions, or we may need to curtail or limit our existing operations. Factory-built housing operates in the highly competitive housing industry, and, if other home builders are more successful or offer better value to our customers, then our business could decline. We operate in a very competitive environment and faces competition from a number of other home builders in each market in which we operate. We compete with large national and regional home building companies and with smaller local home builders for financing, raw materials, and skilled management and labor resources. Some of our manufacturing competitors have captive retail distribution systems and consumer finance and insurance operations. In addition, there are independent factory-built housing retail locations that sell competitors’ products in most areas where our homes are sold and in most areas where we have retail operations. Because barriers to entry to the industry at both the manufacturing and retail levels are low, we believe that it is relatively easy for new competitors to enter our markets. In addition, our products compete within the housing industry more broadly with other forms of low to moderate-cost housing, including site-built homes, panelized homes, apartments, townhouses, condominiums, and repossessed homes. We also compete with resale homes, also referred to as “previously owned” or “existing” homes, as well as rental housing. An oversupply of homes available for sale or the heavy discounting of home prices by our competitors could adversely affect demand for our homes and the results of our operations. An increase in competitive conditions could have any of the following impacts on us: sale of fewer homes or higher cancellations by our home buyers; an increase in selling incentives or reduction of prices; and realization of lower gross margins due to lower selling prices or an inability to increase selling prices to offset increased costs of the homes delivered. If we are unable to compete effectively in our markets, then our business could decline disproportionately to that of our competitors. As a result, our sales could decline and our results of operations and cash flows could suffer. Changes in consumer preferences for our products or our failure to gauge those preferences could lead to reduced sales. We cannot be certain that historical consumer preferences for factory-built homes in general, and for our products in particular, will remain unchanged. Our ability to remain competitive depends heavily on our ability to provide a continuing and timely introduction of innovative product offerings. We believe that the introduction of new features, designs, and models will be critical to the future success of our operations. Managing frequent product introductions poses inherent risks. Delays in the introduction or market acceptance of new models, designs, or product features could have a material adverse effect on our business. Products may not be accepted for a number of reasons, including changes in consumer preferences or our failure to properly gauge consumer preferences. Further, we cannot be certain that new product introductions will not reduce net sales from existing models and adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, our net sales may be adversely affected if our new models and products are not introduced to the market on time or are not successful when introduced. Finally, our competitors’ products may obtain better market acceptance despite our efforts to lead the market. When we introduce new products into the marketplace, we may incur expenses that we did not anticipate, which, in turn, can result in reduced earnings. The introduction of new models, floor plans, and features are critical to our future success, but we may incur unexpected expenses when we make such introductions. For example, we may experience unexpected engineering or design flaws that may cause increased warranty costs. The costs resulting from these types of problems could be substantial and could have a significant adverse effect on our earnings. Estimated warranty costs are accrued at the time of product sale to reflect our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products. An increase in actual warranty claims costs as compared to our estimates could result in increased warranty reserves and expense, which could have adverse impacts on our earnings. Our products and services may experience quality problems from time to time that can result in decreased sales and gross margin and can harm our reputation. Our products contain thousands of parts, many of which are supplied by a network of approved vendors. Product defects may occur, including components purchased from material vendors. There is no assurance that all such defects will be detected prior to the distribution of our products. In addition, although we endeavor to compel suppliers to maintain appropriate levels of insurance coverage, there is no assurance that if a defect in a vendor-supplied part were to occur that the vendor would have the financial ability to rectify the defect. Failure to detect defects in our products, including vendor-supplied parts, could result in lost revenue, increased warranty and related costs, and could harm our reputation. 13 If the factory-built housing industry is not able to secure favorable local zoning ordinances, our sales could decline and our results of operations and cash flows could suffer. Limitations on the number of sites available for placement of factory-built homes or on the operation of factory-built housing communities could reduce the demand for factory-built homes and, as a result, our sales. Factory-built housing communities and individual home placements are subject to local zoning ordinances and other local regulations relating to utility service and construction of roadways. In the past, some property owners have resisted the adoption of zoning ordinances permitting the use of factory-built homes in residential areas, which we believe has restricted the growth of the industry. Factory-built homes may not receive widespread acceptance and localities may not adopt zoning ordinances permitting the development of factory-built home communities. If the factory-built housing industry is unable to secure favorable local zoning ordinances, then our sales could decline and our results of operations and cash flows could suffer. We may not be able to manage our business effectively if we cannot retain current management team members or if we are unable to attract and motivate key personnel. Our success depends upon the skills, experience, and active participation of our senior management and key employees, many of whom have been with us for a significant number of years. Changes in our senior management team or other key employees may result in operational disruptions and changes to the strategy of our business, and our business might be harmed as a result. Our business could be further disrupted and harmed if we were unable to find appropriate replacements on a timely basis following future departures. We may not be able to attract or motivate qualified management and operations personnel in the future. Inability to do so would result in constraints that would significantly impede the achievement of our objectives. We may also have difficulty attracting experienced personnel and may be required to expend significant financial resources in our employee recruitment efforts. Product liability claims and litigation and warranty claims that arise in the ordinary course of business may be costly, which could adversely affect our results of operations. As a home builder, we are subject to construction defect and home warranty claims arising in the ordinary course of business. These claims are common in the home building industry and can be costly. In addition, the costs of insuring against construction defect and product liability claims are high. There can be no assurance that this coverage will not be restricted and become more costly. If the limits or coverages of our current and former insurance programs prove inadequate, or we are unable to obtain adequate or reasonably-priced insurance against these types of claims in the future, or the amounts currently provided for future warranty or insurance claims are inadequate, then we may experience losses that could negatively impact our results of operations. We record expenses and liabilities based on the estimated costs required to cover our self-insured liability under our insurance policies, and estimated costs of potential claims and claim adjustment expenses that are above our coverage limits or that are not covered by our insurance policies. These estimated costs are based on an analysis of our historical claims and industry data, and include an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. Due to the degree of judgment required and the potential for variability in the underlying assumptions when deriving estimated liabilities, our actual future costs could differ from those estimated, and the difference could be material to our results of operations. 14 Data s ecurity breaches , cybersecurity attacks, and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer. In the ordinary course of our business, we collect, use, and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our suppliers and business partners, as well as personally identifiable information of our customers and employees. We also have outsourced elements of our information technology structure, and as a result, we are managing independent vendor relationships with third parties who may or could have access to our confidential information. Similarly, our business partners and other third-party providers possess certain of our sensitive data. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance, or other disruptions, particularly with employees and others on data networks working increasingly from home because of the COVID-19 pandemic and other such factors. We, our partners, vendors, and other third-party providers could be susceptible to third-party attacks on our and their information security systems, which attacks are of ever-increasing levels of sophistication and are made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise, including criminal groups. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost, or stolen. Any such access, disclosure, or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, disrupt our operations, and damage our reputation, any of which could adversely affect our business. We are subject to extensive regulation affecting the production and sale of factory-built housing, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We are subject to a variety of federal, state, and local laws and regulations affecting the production and sale of factory-built housing. Our failure to comply with such laws and regulations could expose us to a wide variety of sanctions, including closing one or more manufacturing facilities. Regulatory matters affecting our operations are under regular review by governmental bodies and we cannot predict what effect, if any, new laws and regulations would have on us or on the factory-built housing industry. Failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or the passage in the future of new and more stringent laws, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Increases in the after-tax costs of owning a factory-built home could deter potential customers from buying our products and adversely affect our business or results of operations. Significant expenses of owning a factory-built home, including mortgage interest expenses and real estate taxes, generally were, under prior tax law, deductible expenses for an individual’s federal income taxes and, in some cases, state income taxes, subject to certain limitations. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, signed into law in December 2017 (the “Tax Act”), included provisions that impose limitations with respect to these income tax deductions. Increases in property tax rates or fees on developers by local governmental authorities, as experienced in response to reduced federal and state funding or to fund local initiatives, such as funding schools or road improvements, or increases in home insurance premiums, also can adversely affect the ability of potential customers to obtain financing or their desire to purchase new homes, and in turn can have adverse impacts on our business and results of operations. The transportation industry is subject to government regulation, and regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Our Star Fleet Trucking subsidiary provides transportation services. The transportation industry is subject to legislative or regulatory changes, including potential limits on carbon emissions under climate change legislation and Department of Transportation regulations regarding, among other things, driver breaks, classification of independent drivers, “restart” rules, and the use of electronic logging devices that can affect the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or influencing the demand for, and cost of providing, transportation services. We may become subject to new or more restrictive regulations relating to fuel emissions or limits on vehicle weight and size. Future laws and regulations may be more stringent and require changes in operating practices, influence the demand for transportation services or increase the cost of providing transportation services, any of which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Natural disasters and severe weather conditions could delay deliveries, increase costs, and decrease demand for new factory-built homes in affected areas. Our operations are located in many areas that are subject to natural disasters and severe weather. The occurrence of natural disasters or severe weather conditions can delay factory-built home deliveries, increase costs by damaging inventories, reduce the availability of materials, and negatively impact the demand for new factory-built homes in affected areas. Furthermore, if our 15 insurance does not fully cover business interruptions or losses resulting from these events, then our earnings, liquidity, or capital resources could be adversely affected. Mergers and acquisitions in which we might engage involve risks that could adversely affect our business. As part of our growth strategy, we may choose to engage in discussions and negotiations regarding transactions, such as mergers, acquisitions and other business combinations within our industry. The purchase price for possible acquisitions of businesses and assets might be paid from cash, borrowings, or through the issuance of common stock or other securities, or a combination of these methods. Business combinations entail numerous risks, including: • difficulties in the integration of acquired operations, services and products, which can impact retention of client accounts; • failure to achieve expected synergies; • diversion of management's attention from other business concerns; • assumption of unknown material liabilities of acquired companies, which could become material or subject us to litigation or regulatory risks; • amortization of acquired intangible assets, which could reduce future reported earnings; and • potential loss of customers or key employees. We cannot be certain that we will be able to identify, consummate and successfully integrate business combinations, and no assurance can be given with respect to the timing, likelihood or business effect of any possible transaction. For example, we could begin negotiations that we subsequently decide to suspend or terminate for a variety of reasons. Also, business combinations are typically subject to closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and the absence of a material adverse change. Therefore, if and when we enter into a business combination agreement, there can be no guarantee that the transaction will close when expected, or at all. If a material transaction does not close, then our stock price could decline. Nevertheless, opportunities arise from time to time that we choose to evaluate. Any transactions that we pursue and consummate would involve these risks and uncertainties, as well as others. The risks of a business combination could result in the failure of the anticipated benefits of that particular combination to be realized, which in turn could have adverse effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Changes in foreign exchange rates could adversely affect the value of our investments in Canada and cause foreign exchange losses. We have substantial investments in businesses in Canada. Unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates could adversely affect the value of our investments in these businesses. Our failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could harm our business and financial results. Our management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that we would prevent or detect a misstatement of our financial statements or fraud. We anticipate paying no cash dividends for the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, for the foreseeable future, to fund the development and growth of our business. As a result, capital appreciation in the price of our common stock, if any, will be investors’ only source of gain on an investment in our common stock. Any future determination to pay dividends to shareholders will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including general economic conditions, our financial condition and results of operations, our available cash and current and anticipated cash needs, capital requirements, contractual, legal, tax and regulatory restrictions, the implications of the payment of dividends by us to our shareholders or by our subsidiaries to us, and any other factors that the board of directors may deem relevant. 16 A n impairment of all or part of our goodwill could adversely affect our operating results and net worth . As of March 28, 2020, 22% of our total assets consisted of goodwill, all of which is allocated to reporting units included in the U.S. Factory-built Housing segment. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") Accounting Standards Codification (""ASC"") 350, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other (""ASC 350""), we test goodwill at least annually for impairment or more often than annually if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment is more likely than not to have occurred. If goodwill has become impaired, we charge the impairment as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs. See Item 7, ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Policies"" and Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. A write-off of all or part of our goodwill could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. The replacement or modification of LIBOR as a reference rate could increase our interest expense in the future. The London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) is expected to be phased out by the end of 2021. LIBOR is currently used as the reference rate on our credit facility, which matures on June 5, 2023. Currently, no replacement rate has been identified. The transition from LIBOR could result in higher interest expense than has historically been recognized. Our risk management practices may leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risk. Our management team is responsible for managing risk, subject to oversight by our board of directors. Our risk management methods may not identify all future risk exposures and may not be completely effective in mitigating all key risks. Furthermore, our risk management methods may not properly identify and mitigate the aggregation of risks across the Company or the interdependency of our risk mitigation efforts. In addition, some of our risk management methods may be based on assumptions that will prove to be inaccurate. Failure to manage risk effectively could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 17 ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. ITEM 2.

At March 28, 2020, we also own or lease five manufacturing facilities that have been idled since 2017 or prior and could be utilized for additional production capacity. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS We are party to certain legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course and are incidental to our business. Certain of the claims pending against us in these proceedings allege, among other things, breach of express and implied warranties, and in various governmental agency proceedings arising from occupational safety and health, wage and hour, and similar employment and workplace regulations. Although litigation is inherently uncertain, based on past experience and the information currently available, management does not believe that the currently pending and threatened litigation or claims will have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations. However, future events or circumstances, currently unknown to us, will determine whether the resolution of pending or threatened litigation or claims will ultimately have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of operations in any future reporting periods.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following should be read in conjunction with Skyline Champion Corporation’s consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this Annual Report. Certain statements set forth below under this caption constitute forward-looking statements. See Part I, “Cautionary Statement About Forward-Looking Statements,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional factors relating to such statements, and see Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” of this Annual Report for a discussion of certain risks applicable to our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Overview Champion Enterprises Holding, LLC (“Champion Holdings”) was formed as a Delaware limited liability company in 2010. Skyline Corporation (“Skyline”) was originally incorporated in Indiana. On June 1, 2018, Skyline Champion Corporation (the “Company”) was formed by Skyline and Champion Holdings combining their operations pursuant to the Exchange Agreement. The Company is a leading producer of factory-built housing in the U.S. and Canada. The Company serves as a complete solutions provider across complementary and vertically integrated businesses including manufactured construction, company-owned retail locations, and transportation logistics services. The Company is the largest independent publicly traded factory-built solutions provider in North America based on revenue, and markets its homes under several nationally recognized brand names including Skyline Homes, Champion Home Builders, Genesis Homes, Athens Park Models, Dutch Housing, Excel Homes, Homes of Merit, New Era, Redman Homes, Shore Park, Silvercrest, and Titan Homes in the U.S. and Moduline and SRI Homes in western Canada. At March 28, 2020, the Company operates 33 manufacturing facilities throughout the U.S. and 5 manufacturing facilities in western Canada that primarily construct factory-built, timber-framed manufactured and modular houses that are sold primarily to independent retailers, builders/developers, and manufactured home community operators. The Company’s retail operations consist of 21 sales centers that sell manufactured homes to consumers primarily in the southern U.S. The Company’s transportation business engages independent owners/drivers to transport manufactured homes, recreational vehicles, and other products throughout the U.S. and Canada. Acquisitions and Expansions Over the last several years, demand for the Company’s products, primarily affordable housing in the U.S., has continued to improve. As a result, the Company has focused on operational improvements to make existing manufacturing facilities more profitable as well as executing measured expansion of its manufacturing and retail footprint. The Company has increased capacity through strategic acquisitions and expansions of its manufacturing footprint. The Company is focused on growing in strong HUD markets across the U.S. as well as further expanding into the Northeast and Midwest U.S. modular housing markets. The Company began production at its newest manufactured housing facility in Leesville, Louisiana in June 2019. During fiscal 2019, the Company completed its expansion of the Corona, California facility by adding a second production line and expanded its Leola, Pennsylvania campus by adding an additional plant. Production at the Leola facility began in April 2019. The Exchange added eight plants to the Company’s manufacturing footprint in fiscal 2019. The Company has also focused on expansion of its company-owned retail operations, opening three additional retail sales centers during fiscal 2018. Management believes retail expansion provides an opportunity to increase the Company’s presence in market segments that are not currently served through its independent retail network, while also providing for increased utilization of existing manufacturing operations. These acquisitions and investments are part of a strategy to grow and diversify revenue with a focus on increasing the Company’s HUD and modular homebuilding presence in the U.S. as well as improving the results of operations. These acquisitions and investments are included in the consolidated results for periods subsequent to their respective acquisition dates. 23 Combination with Skyline On January 5, 2018, Champion Holdings and Skyline entered into an Exchange Agreement pursuant to which the two companies agreed to combine their operations. The Exchange was completed on June 1, 2018 and was accounted for as a reverse acquisition under the acquisition method of accounting as provided by FASB ASC 805, Business Combinations (“ASC 805”). Champion Holdings was determined to be the acquirer for accounting and financial reporting purposes. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed by Champion Holdings as a result of the Exchange were recorded at their respective fair values and added to the carrying value of Champion Holdings existing assets and liabilities. As Champion Holdings is the accounting acquirer, reported financial results for Skyline Champion Corporation for fiscal 2019 are comprised of: 1) the results of Champion Holdings through June 1, 2018 and 2) the combined operations of the Company, after giving effect to the Exchange, from June 1, 2018 through March 30, 2019. All annual periods presented prior to the effective date of the Exchange are comprised solely of the results of Champion Holdings and all annual periods presented subsequent to fiscal 2019 are comprised solely of the results of the Company. Industry and Company Outlook In recent years, manufactured home construction experienced revenue growth due to a number of favorable demographic trends and demand drivers in the United States, including underlying growth trends in key homebuyer groups, such as the population over 65 years of age, the population of first-time home buyers, and the population of households earning less than $50,000 per year. More recently, we see a number of market trends pointing to increased sales of ADUs and urban to rural migration as customers accommodate working-from-home patterns and protocols, as well as people seeking rent-to-own single-family options. We intend to capitalize on these trends and drivers to grow our business over the medium to long-term. We believe that there is an opportunity for continued manufactured and modular construction market with medium term expansion driven by the foregoing trends and demand drivers, as well as construction labor shortages in certain regions (which tend to adversely and disproportionally impact supply and cost of site-built homes when compared to manufactured housing) and increased affordability of factory-built homes relative to site-built homes. For fiscal 2020, approximately 76% of the Company’s U.S. manufacturing sales were generated from the manufacture of homes that comply with the Federal HUD code construction standard in the U.S. According to data reported by MHI, HUD code industry home shipments were 97,553; 93,265 and 90,729 units (excluding FEMA units) during fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Industry shipments of HUD-code FEMA units were 112 and 4,315 in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. There were no industry shipments of HUD code FEMA units in fiscal 2020 or 2019. Based on industry data, the Company’s U.S. wholesale market share of HUD code homes sold was 16.5%, 16.6%, 13.9% in fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018. Annual shipments have generally increased each year since calendar year 2009 when only 50,000 HUD code manufactured homes were shipped, the lowest level since the industry began recording statistics in 1959. While shipments of HUD code manufactured homes have improved modestly in recent years, manufactured housing’s most recent annual shipment levels still operate at lower levels than the long-term historical average of over 200,000 units annually . For fiscal 2020, approximately 17% of the Company’s U.S. manufacturing sales were generated from the sale of modular homes. The Company measures and reports on U.S. modular market share three months in arrears. Industry shipments of modular homes in the U.S. of 14,690 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 was 5.4% lower than the 15,530 units shipped in the comparable period of calendar year 2018. The Company’s modular market share during these periods was 13.9% and 13.1%, respectively. Modular home sales across the industry have generally been stable since 2009. COVID-19 Pandemic The outbreak of COVID-19 has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and continues to spread in the United States and Canada. The COVID-19 pandemic poses the risk that the Company or its employees, suppliers, customers and others may be restricted or prevented from conducting business activities for indefinite or intermittent periods of time, including as a result of employee health and safety concerns, shutdowns, shelter in place orders, travel restrictions and other actions and restrictions that may be requested or mandated by governmental authorities. In response to dynamics brought on by COVID-19, the Company has prioritized the safety and well-being of its employees and customers. Skyline Champion has carefully managed expenses by reducing non-essential spending and furloughing certain employees with many now taking advantage of benefits provided by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”). Beginning in March 2020, the Company temporarily idled several of its manufacturing facilities due to stay-at-home orders, supplier disruptions, and a decline in demand resulting from these restrictions as well as the temporary closure of some of the Company’s independent retailers. Upon initial shelter-in-place orders, Skyline Champion rolled out a temporary emergency sick pay policy which allowed limited pay for employees impacted by COVID-19. During April 2020, the Company reduced its workforce by 5%, to 24 approximately 6,600 employees and furloughed many more employees due to government stay-at-home orders or reduced demand. During this time, the Company chose to continue to pay its share of the costs associated with providing uninterrupted health care benefits to its furloughed employees. The Company reopened many of the temporarily idled manufacturing facilities in late April, at reduced production levels due to social distancing protocols and decreased demand. Skyline Champion will continue to manage its manufacturing footprint and be prepared to reopen or idle additional facilities as restrictions change and demand warrants. Further, the Company may experience disruptions in its supply chain which could increase material costs for its products. There is significant uncertainty regarding the extent and duration of the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on the economy and the housing market. As a result, its impact on the Company’s fiscal 2021 results is uncertain. As the U.S. economy gradually recovers from the impacts of COVID-19, the Company will seek to capture additional demand from manufactured housing communities that increase spending on expansion and development projects. In addition, if financing availability continues to improve and related regulation continues to ease, the Company believes that there will be an increase in the number of prospective customers who qualify for home loans for manufactured and modular homes. The Company remains confident in the long-term growth opportunities and believes that it has sufficient cash and cash equivalents to meet its liquidity needs in the next twelve months. As of March 28, 2020, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $209.5 million. 25 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR FISCAL 20 20 VS. 201 9 Year Ended (Dollars in thousands) March 28, 2020 March 30, 2019 Results of Operations Data: Net sales $ 1,369,730 $ 1,360,043 Cost of sales 1,090,755 1,114,684 Gross profit 278,975 245,359 Selling, general, and administrative expenses 192,520 275,101 Operating income (loss) 86,455 (29,742 ) Interest expense, net 1,401 3,290 Other expense — 8,271 Income (loss) from operations before income taxes 85,054 (41,303 ) Income tax expense 26,894 16,905 Net income (loss) $ 58,160 $ (58,208 ) Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA: Net income (loss) $ 58,160 $ (58,208 ) Income tax expense 26,894 16,905 Interest expense, net 1,401 3,290 Depreciation and amortization 18,546 16,079 Equity-based compensation (for awards granted prior to December 31, 2018) 4,576 101,025 Foreign currency transaction loss 235 123 Transaction costs — 8,201 Acquisition integration costs 2,674 7,966 Fair market value adjustment for asset classified as held for sale 986 — Property, plant, and equipment impairment charge 550 — Restructuring costs 366 1,640 Other (24 ) 70 Adjusted EBITDA $ 114,364 $ 97,091 As a percent of net sales: Gross profit 20.4 % 18.0 % Selling, general and administrative expenses 14.1 % 20.2 % Operating income (loss) 6.3 % (2.2 %) Net income (loss) 4.2 % (4.3 %) Adjusted EBITDA 8.3 % 7.1 % 26 N ET SALES The following table summarizes net sales for fiscal 2020 and 2019: Year Ended (Dollars in thousands) March 28, 2020 March 30, 2019 $ Change % Change Net sales $ 1,369,730 $ 1,360,043 $ 9,687 0.7 % U.S. manufacturing and retail net sales $ 1,226,393 $ 1,177,687 $ 48,706 4.1 % U.S. homes sold 20,110 19,443 667 3.4 % U.S. manufacturing and retail average home selling price $ 61.0 $ 60.6 $ 0.4 0.7 % Canadian manufacturing net sales $ 84,196 $ 98,567 $ (14,371 ) (14.6 %) Canadian homes sold 1,002 1,232 (230 ) (18.7 %) Canadian manufacturing average home selling price $ 84.0 $ 80.0 $ 4.0 5.0 % Corporate/Other net sales $ 59,141 $ 83,789 $ (24,648 ) (29.4 %) U.S. manufacturing facilities in operation at year end 33 31 2 6.5 % U.S. retail sales centers in operation at year end 21 21 — — % Canadian manufacturing facilities in operation at year end 5 5 — — % Net sales for fiscal 2020 were $1,369.7 million, an increase of $9.7 million, or 0.7% over fiscal 2019. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. U.S. Factory-built Housing: Sales of homes for the Company’s U.S. manufacturing and retail operations increased by $48.7 million, or 4.1%. The net sales increase was attributable to the following factors including: (i) an increase of 667, or 3.4%, in the number of homes sold and (ii) a 0.7% increase in the average home selling price. The inclusion of the Skyline operations for the full year of fiscal 2020 added $48.2 million of sales, as fiscal 2019 included only ten months of Skyline operations. Canadian Factory-built Housing: The Canadian Factory-built Housing segment net sales decreased by $14.4 million, or 14.6% for fiscal 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to an 18.7% decrease in homes sold. This decrease was partially offset by a 5.0% increase the average selling price of homes. The number of homes sold decreased due to the decline in factory-built housing demand in the British Columbia and Alberta provinces versus the same period in the prior year. The decline in demand was and is due to oil and energy-related market dynamics in western Canada. Net sales for the Canadian segment were also unfavorably impacted by approximately $1.3 million as the Canadian dollar weakened relative to the U.S. dollar during fiscal 2020 as compared to the same period of the prior year. Corporate/Other: Net sales for Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation business and the elimination of intersegment sales. For fiscal 2020, net sales decreased by $24.6 million, or 29.4%. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower net sales in the Company’s transportation business primarily as a result of lower shipments associated with reduced RV demand in the U.S. and changes in customer mix, partially offset by increased net sales of manufactured housing products. 27 GROSS PROFIT The following table summarizes gross profit for fiscal 2020 and 2019 : Year Ended (Dollars in thousands) March 28, 2020 March 30, 2019 $ Change % Change Gross profit: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 250,222 $ 214,142 $ 36,080 16.8 % Canadian Factory-built Housing 16,512 18,309 (1,797 ) (9.8 %) Corporate/Other 12,241 12,908 (667 ) (5.2 %) Total gross profit $ 278,975 $ 245,359 $ 33,616 13.7 % Gross profit as a percent of net sales 20.4 % 18.0 % Gross profit as a percent of sales during fiscal 2020 was 20.4% compared to 18.0% during fiscal 2019. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. U.S. Factory-built Housing: Gross profit for the U.S. Factory-built Housing segment increased by $36.1 million, or 16.8%, during fiscal 2020 compared to the prior year. The increase in gross profit is due to the increase in sales volume and improved margins resulting from a reduction in manufacturing costs. Gross profit was 20.4% as a percent of segment net sales for fiscal 2020 compared to 18.2% in the prior year. Gross profit expansion was driven by favorable material pricing, procurement and operational synergies related to the Exchange, and plant operating improvements, all of which were partially offset by labor inflation. Canadian Factory-built Housing: Gross profit for the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment decreased by $1.8 million, or 9.8%, during fiscal 2020 compared to the prior year and increased to 19.6% as a percent of segment net sales from 18.6%. Although the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment saw lower volume compared to the prior period, margins improved due to higher average selling prices on homes sold. Corporate/Other: Gross profit for the Corporate/Other segment decreased by $0.7 million, or 5.2%, during fiscal 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year. However, Corporate/Other gross profit improved as a percent of segment net sales to 20.7% from 15.4%. Gross margins for the Company’s transportation business improved as a percent of sales due to a change in revenue mix and lower variable expenses. A portion of the change in revenue mix is due in part to changes in the customer base, which included less brokered business to other providers at lower margins in response to the decline in revenue caused by the softening market demand for RVs . SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Selling, general, and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses include foreign currency transaction gains and losses, equity compensation, and intangible amortization expense. The following table summarizes selling, general, and administrative expenses for fiscal 2020 and 2019: Year Ended (Dollars in thousands) March 28, 2020 March 30, 2019 $ Change % Change Selling, general, and administrative expenses: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 135,329 $ 116,379 $ 18,950 16.3 % Canadian Factory-built Housing 8,313 9,058 (745 ) (8.2 %) Corporate/Other 48,878 149,664 (100,786 ) (67.3 %) Total selling, general, and administrative expenses $ 192,520 $ 275,101 $ (82,581 ) (30.0 %) Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales 14.1 % 20.2 % 28 Selling, general , and administrative expenses were $192.5 million for fiscal 20 20 , a decrease of $82.6 million compared to the prior year . The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. U.S. Factory-built Housing: Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the U.S. Factory-built Housing segment increased by $19.0 million, or 16.3%, during fiscal 2020 as compared to the prior year. Selling, general, and administrative expenses, as a percent of segment net sales, was 11.0% for fiscal 2020 compared to 9.9% during fiscal 2019. SG&A costs increased due to a combination of factors, and was primarily driven by: (i) an increase in salaries and benefits to maintain competitive compensation packages to retain and recruit team members, and (ii) higher sales commissions and incentive compensation, which is generally based on sales volume or a measure of profitability. The increase in salaries, benefits, and incentive compensation was approximately $7.7 million in total. In addition, the inclusion of the Skyline operations for all twelve months of fiscal 2020 increased SG&A expenses by $4.7 million compared to fiscal 2019, which included only ten months of Skyline operations. Lastly, the Company recorded additional SG&A costs for the Leesville, LA capacity expansion of $2.0 million and increased spending on marketing and advertising initiatives of $1.0 million during fiscal 2020. Canadian Factory-built Housing: Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment decreased by $0.7 million, or 8.2%, during fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019. As a percent of segment net sales, selling, general, and administrative expenses for the Canadian segment was 9.9% for fiscal 2020 compared to 9.2% for fiscal 2019. Selling, general, and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales increased in the current period due to the decrease in net sales and reduced leverage of fixed costs. Corporate/Other: Selling, general, and administrative expenses for Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation operations, corporate costs incurred for all segments, and intersegment eliminations. Selling, general, and administrative expenses for Corporate/Other decreased by $100.8 million, or 67.3%, during fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019. The decrease is mainly due to a change in equity-based compensation expense of $93.7 million, primarily related to the Exchange and secondary offerings that occurred in the prior year, as well as a reduction in acquisition integration and restructuring costs of $6.6 million. This decrease was partially offset by a fair market value adjustment charge of $1.0 million related to property acquired in the Exchange. INTEREST EXPENSE The following table summarizes the components of interest expense, net for fiscal 2020 and 2019: Year Ended (Dollars in thousands) March 28, 2020 March 30, 2019 $ Change % Change Interest expense $ 4,632 $ 5,333 $ (701 ) (13.1 %) Interest income (3,231 ) (2,043 ) (1,188 ) 58.1 % Interest expense, net $ 1,401 $ 3,290 $ (1,889 ) (57.4 %) Average outstanding floor plan payable $ 31,962 $ 32,288 Average outstanding long-term debt $ 48,747 $ 58,959 Interest expense, net was $1.4 million for fiscal 2020, a decrease of $1.9 million compared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily related to higher interest income recognized during the period as a result of higher average cash balances invested in short term facilities. In addition, the Company incurred reduced interest expense due to; (i) a lower weighted average interest rate on its revolving credit facility of 3.5% as compared to 4.7%, and (ii) lower average outstanding balances on its credit facilities as compared to the same period in the prior year. 29 OTHER EXPENSE The following table summarizes other expense for fiscal 2020 and 2019: Year Ended (Dollars in thousands) March 28, 2020 March 30, 2019 $ Change % Change Other expense $ — $ 8,271 $ (8,271 ) (100.0 %) Other expense for fiscal 2019 primarily consisted of $8.2 million of expenses for legal, accounting, and advisory services related to the Exchange and four offerings of the Company’s common stock subsequent to the Exchange (“Offerings”), as well as $0.1 million for the deductible on an insured loss at one of the Company’s retail sales centers. The Company incurred no such costs in fiscal 2020. INCOME TAX EXPENSE The following table summarizes income tax expense for fiscal 2020 and 2019: Year Ended (Dollars in thousands) March 28, 2020 March 30, 2019 $ Change % Change Income tax expense $ 26,894 $ 16,905 $ 9,989 59.1 % Effective tax rate 31.6 % (40.9 %) Income tax expense for fiscal 2020 was $26.9 million, representing an effective tax rate of 31.6%, compared to income tax expense of $16.9 million, representing an effective tax rate of (40.9%), for fiscal 2019. The Company’s effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of 21.0%, due primarily to the effect of non-deductible expenses, tax credits, state and local income taxes, changes in valuation allowances, and results in foreign jurisdictions. The Company’s effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 differed from the federal statutory income tax rate of 21.0%, due primarily to the effect of non-deductible expenses, many of which were a result of the Exchange, state and local income taxes, and results in foreign jurisdictions. ADJUSTED EBITDA The following table reconciles net income, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, to Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, for fiscal 2020 and 2019: Year Ended (Dollars in thousands) March 28, 2020 March 30, 2019 $ Change % Change Net income (loss) $ 58,160 $ (58,208 ) $ 116,368 199.9 % Income tax expense 26,894 16,905 9,989 59.1 % Interest expense, net 1,401 3,290 (1,889 ) (57.4 %) Depreciation and amortization 18,546 16,079 2,467 15.3 % Equity-based compensation (for awards granted prior to December 31, 2018) 4,576 101,025 (96,449 ) (95.5 %) Foreign currency transaction loss 235 123 112 91.1 % Transaction costs — 8,201 (8,201 ) (100.0 %) Acquisition integration costs 2,674 7,966 (5,292 ) (66.4 %) Fair market value adjustment for asset classified as held for sale 986 — 986 * Property, plant, and equipment impairment charge 550 — 550 * Restructuring costs 366 1,640 (1,274 ) (77.7 %) Other (24 ) 70 (94 ) (134.3 %) Adjusted EBITDA $ 114,364 $ 97,091 $ 17,273 17.8 % * indicates that the calculated percentage is not meaningful 30 Adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2020 was $114.4 million, an increase of $17.3 million over fiscal 2019. The increase is primarily a result of increased operating income after adjusting for the effect of increased depreciation and amortization, transaction, integration and restructuring costs, and non-cash equity-based compensation incurred in connection with the Exchange, and the Offerings and the integration of Skyline. The increase in operating income is primarily due to improvements in sales volumes and gross profit margins as a percent of net sales partially offset by higher selling, general, and administrative costs.

The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. U.S. Factory-built Housing: The U.S. Factory-built Housing segment accounted for the majority of the overall growth in net sales for fiscal 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year. Sales of homes for the Company’s U.S. manufacturing and retail operations increased by $317.2 million, or 36.9%. The number of homes sold during fiscal 2019 increased by 3,303 units, or 20.5%. The net sales increase was attributable to the following factors including: (i) the inclusion of net sales of $218.8 million for the Skyline operations for the period following the completion of the Exchange; and (ii) a 13.6% increase in the average home selling price as a result of product mix and pricing actions to offset the impact of fluctuating material and labor costs. The Company’s U.S. HUD market share for fiscal 2019 grew to 16.6% from 13.9% in the prior year due primarily to the inclusion of Skyline operations. U.S. HUD industry units shipped during fiscal 2019 were 93,377 which represented a slight decrease from the 95,044 units shipped in the prior year. U.S. HUD industry shipments for fiscal 2019 did not include any FEMA disaster relief homes, according to data published by MHI. Fiscal 2019 industry shipments include the sale of 112 disaster relief homes produced for FEMA compared to 4,415 in fiscal 2018. Canadian Factory-built Housing: The Canadian Factory-built Housing segment net sales increased by $2.0 million, or 2.0%, for fiscal 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a 4.8% increase in average selling price, which was a result of pricing actions taken by the Company to offset the impact of rising material and labor costs. This increase was offset by a 2.7% decrease in homes sold. Net sales were unfavorably impacted by approximately $1.9 million as the Canadian dollar weakened compared to the U.S. dollar during fiscal 2019 as compared to the same period of the prior year. Corporate/Other: Net sales for Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation business and the elimination of intersegment sales. For fiscal 2019, net sales decreased by $23.8 million, or 22.2%. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower net sales in the Company’s transportation business primarily as a result of lower shipments associated with reduced RV demand in the U.S. 32 GROSS PROFIT The following table summarizes gross profit for fiscal 2019 and 2018: Year Ended (Dollars in thousands) March 30, 2019 March 31, 2018 $ Change % Change Gross profit: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 214,142 $ 143,632 $ 70,510 49.1 % Canadian Factory-built Housing 18,309 18,415 (106 ) (0.6 %) Corporate/Other 12,908 15,064 (2,156 ) (14.3 %) Total gross profit $ 245,359 $ 177,111 $ 68,248 38.5 % Gross profit as a percent of net sales 18.0 % 16.6 % Gross profit as a percent of sales during fiscal 2019 was 18.0% compared to 16.6% during fiscal 2018. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. U.S. Factory-built Housing: Gross profit for the U.S. Factory-built Housing segment increased by $70.5 million, or 49.1%, during fiscal 2019 compared to the prior year. Gross profit was 18.2% as a percent of segment net sales for fiscal 2019 compared to 16.7% in the prior year. The 150 basis point increase in gross profit as a percent of sales is due to a combination of factors. The Company has benefited from the synergy capture from the Exchange with Skyline and continues to standardize its core product design and material purchases which allow for more efficient production for its supply chain and helps to mitigate material commodity fluctuations. The Company also continues to focus on better understanding its cost structure and discontinuing models and options that customers do not value. Canadian Factory-built Housing: Gross profit for the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment decreased by $0.1 million, or 0.6%, during fiscal 2019 compared to the prior year and decreased to 18.6% as a percent of segment net sales from 19.1%. The decrease is primarily due to lower sales volume. Corporate/Other: Gross profit for the Corporate/Other segment decreased by $2.2 million, or 14.3%, during fiscal 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year. However, Corporate/Other gross profit improved as a percent of segment net sales to 15.4% from 14.0%. Although overall the transportation business activity was lower than the prior year, gross margins improved as a percent of sales due to product mix. SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES: The following table summarizes selling, general, and administrative expenses for fiscal 2019 and 2018: Year Ended (Dollars in thousands) March 30, 2019 March 31, 2018 $ Change % Change Selling, general, and administrative expenses: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 116,379 $ 83,486 $ 32,893 39.4 % Canadian Factory-built Housing 9,058 8,768 290 3.3 % Corporate/Other 149,664 30,268 119,396 394.5 % Total selling, general, and administrative expenses $ 275,101 $ 122,522 $ 152,579 124.5 % Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales 20.2 % 11.5 % 33 Selling , general , and administrative expenses were $ 275.1 million for fiscal 2019 , an increase of $ 152 . 6 million compared to the prior year .

U.S. Factory-built Housing: Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the U.S. Factory-built Housing segment increased by $32.9 million, or 39.4%, during fiscal 2019 as compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily a result of an increase of $14.5 million related to the inclusion of the Skyline operations subsequent to the Exchange, an increase of $8.7 million related to higher sales commissions and incentive compensation (which is generally based on sales volume or a measure of profitability), an increase of $4.3 million for additional amortization related to the Exchange, an increase of approximately $1.0 million related to investments in plant ramp up of previously idled facilities, and $1.9 million of other administrative and marketing costs. As a result of the increases above, selling, general, and administrative expenses, as a percent of segment net sales, was 9.9% for fiscal 2019 compared to 9.7% during fiscal 2018. Canadian Factory-built Housing: Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment increased by $0.3 million, or 3.3%, during fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018. As a percent of segment net sales, selling, general, and administrative expenses for the Canadian segment was 9.2% for fiscal 2019 compared to 9.1% for fiscal 2018. Corporate/Other: Selling, general, and administrative expenses for Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation operations, corporate costs incurred for all segments and intersegment eliminations. Selling, general, and administrative expenses for Corporate/Other increased by $119.4 million during fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018. The increase is primarily a result of an increase of $101.4 million in non-cash, equity-based compensation expense, an increase of $7.6 million increase for Skyline integration costs, an increase of $3.1 million of costs related to the inclusion of the Skyline corporate departments subsequent to the Exchange, an increase of $2.4 million in legal and professional fees, and an increase of $1.6 million of restructuring costs primarily related to redundant corporate and administrative costs subsequent to the Exchange. INTEREST EXPENSE, NET The following table summarizes the components of interest expense, net for fiscal 2019 and 2018: Year Ended (Dollars in thousands) March 30, 2019 March 31, 2018 $ Change % Change Interest expense $ 5,333 $ 5,133 $ 200 3.9 % Interest income (2,043 ) (948 ) (1,095 ) 115.5 % Interest expense, net $ 3,290 $ 4,185 $ (895 ) (21.4 %) Average outstanding floor plan payable $ 32,288 $ 21,739 Average outstanding long-term debt $ 58,959 $ 59,604 Interest expense, net was $3.3 million for fiscal 2019, a decrease of $0.9 million compared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily related to higher interest income recognized during the period as a result of higher average cash balances invested in short term facilities. OTHER EXPENSE The following table summarizes other expense for fiscal 2019 and 2018: Year Ended (Dollars in thousands) March 30, 2019 March 31, 2018 $ Change % Change Other expense $ 8,271 $ 7,288 $ 983 13.5 % 34 Other expense for fiscal 2019 primarily consisted of $8.2 million of expenses for legal, accounting, and advisory services related to the Exchange and four offerings of the Company’s common stock subsequent to the Exchange (“Offerings”), as well as $0.1 million for the deductible on an insured loss at one of the Company’s retail sales centers. During fiscal 2018, the Company incurred $7.3 million of expenses related to legal and accounting services associated with the Exchange.

The Company’s effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of 21.0%, due primarily to the effect of non-deductible expenses, many of which were a result of the Exchange, state and local income taxes, and results in foreign jurisdictions. The Company’s effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 differed from the blended federal statutory rate of 31.5% primarily due to the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new corporate income tax rate of 21%, from 35% due to the comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act ”) as well as the effect of non-deductible expense, state and local income taxes, and results of operations in foreign jurisdictions and non-taxable entities.

Pro Forma Results of Operations In addition to the analysis of historical results of operations, this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes unaudited supplemental pro forma results of operations for fiscal 2019 and 2018. The unaudited pro forma results of operations reflect pro forma adjustments to the results of the Company to give effect to the Exchange and the related financing transactions (the “Financing”) as if they had occurred on April 2, 2017, the beginning of fiscal 2018. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information of the Company combines the accounting periods of Champion Holdings and Skyline Corporation. Champion Holdings and Skyline had different fiscal year ends. Regulation S-X, Rule 11-02(c)(3) allows the combination of financial information for companies if their fiscal years end within 93 days of each other. Skyline’s results for these periods were derived from their unaudited consolidated income statements. Champion Holdings’ historical results are derived from Champion Holdings’ consolidated statements of operations for fiscal 2019 and 2018. The unaudited pro forma adjustments, for activities up to the date of the Exchange, include: • Adjustments to depreciation expense for the stepped-up basis of property, plant, and equipment; • Adjustments to the amortization of intangible assets recognized in connection with the Exchange; • Adjustments to interest expense for the elimination of historical interest expense and amortization of deferred financing fees on retired debt; • Recognition of interest expense and amortization of deferred financing fees on the new revolving credit agreement; • Adjustments to eliminate expenses incurred directly related to the Exchange; • Adjustments to eliminate one-time equity-based compensation incurred directly related to the Exchange; • Adjustments to eliminate the net currency translation gains and losses on certain intercompany debt; • Adjustments to eliminate the management fee, plus reimbursable expenses, paid by Champion Holdings to its primary investors under a management service agreement; and • Adjustments to reflect tax expense for the unaudited pro forma adjustments 36 Year Ended (Dollars in thousands) March 30, 2019 March 31, 2018 (unaudited) Pro Forma Results of Operations Data: Net sales $ 1,405,847 $ 1,297,159 Cost of sales 1,152,772 1,090,349 Gross profit 253,075 206,810 Selling, general and administrative expenses 272,277 148,475 Operating (loss) income (19,202 ) 58,335 Interest expense, net 3,175 3,797 Other expense 1,858 94 (Loss) income from operations before income taxes (24,235 ) 54,444 Income tax expense 19,225 28,789 Net (loss) income $ (43,460 ) $ 25,655 Reconciliation of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA: Net (loss) income $ (43,460 ) $ 25,655 Income tax expense 19,225 28,789 Interest expense, net 3,175 3,797 Depreciation and amortization 17,244 16,065 Equity-based compensation (for awards granted prior to December 31, 2018) 93,132 916 Foreign currency transaction loss (gain) 123 (176 ) Transaction costs 1,788 — Acquisition integration costs 7,966 386 Restructuring costs 1,640 1,132 Gain on sale of non-operating facilities — (2,104 ) Lower of cost or market adjustment of development inventory — 1,165 Other 70 328 Adjusted EBITDA $ 100,903 $ 75,953 As a percent of net sales: Gross profit 18.0 % 15.9 % Selling, general and administrative expenses 19.4 % 11.4 % Operating (loss) income (1.4 %) 4.5 % Net (loss) income (3.1 %) 2.0 % Adjusted EBITDA 7.2 % 5.9 % Pro Forma Net Sales: Pro forma net sales for fiscal 2019 were $1,405.8 million compared to $1,297.2 million in the prior year, an increase of $108.6 million. The increase was attributable to an increase in number of units sold, and an increase in the average home selling price as a result of product mix and pricing actions to offset the impact of fluctuating material and labor costs and plant operating improvements. Pro Forma Gross Profit: Pro forma gross profit increased by $46.3 million during fiscal 2019 the compared to the same period of the prior year and improved as a percent of net sales to 18.0% from 15.9%. The increase in gross profit as a percent of net sales is consistent with the synergy capture, operational improvements and product rationalization actions taken by the Company as discussed above. The continued standardization of product design and material purchases has allowed for more efficient production for the Company and its supply chain and helped to mitigate the effects of commodity and labor fluctuations occurring in the market place. Pro Forma Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses: Pro forma selling, general, and administrative expenses were $272.3 million for fiscal 2019 as compared to $148.5 million for fiscal 2018. The increase was primarily the result of increased non-cash, equity-based compensation expense of $92.2 million, increased sales commissions and incentive compensation of $9.4 million (which is generally based on sales volume or a measure of profitability), and increased costs incurred with the integration of the Skyline operations of $7.6 million. 37 Pro Forma Interest Expense, Net: Pro forma interest expense, net was $ 3.2 million for fiscal 2019 , a decrease of $ 0.6 million from the same period of the prior year. The overall decrease was primarily attributable to additional interest income earned from higher average cash balances invested in short-term facilities. Pro Forma Other Expense: Other expense for fiscal 2019 primarily consisted of expenses for legal, accounting and advisory services attributable to the Exchange and the Offerings. Pro Forma Income Tax Expense: During fiscal 2019, the Company had pro forma income tax expense of $19.2 million and an effective tax rate of (79.3%), compared to income tax expense of $28.8 million at an effective tax rate of 52.9% during fiscal 2018. Prior to the completion of the Exchange, Skyline recognized no income tax expense or benefit as a result of historical operating loss carryforwards which had a full valuation allowance. A portion of the valuation allowance was reversed upon completion of the Exchange, however, that reversal did not have an impact on the pro forma results of operations. The pro forma income tax effects were a result of the income tax effects of the Company discussed above plus the tax impact of the pro forma adjustments. BACKLOG Although orders from customers can be cancelled at any time without penalty, and unfilled orders are not necessarily an indication of future business, the Company’s unfilled U.S. and Canadian manufacturing orders for homes at March 28, 2020 totaled $127.5 million compared to $142.7 million at March 30, 2019. Approximately one-third of the year-over-year decline in backlog is concentrated at the Company’s Canadian operations, which were impacted by softness in the western Canada housing markets. U.S. backlogs are down due to added capacity and increased production rates at certain plants. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The following table presents summary cash flow information for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018: Year Ended (Dollars in thousands) March 28, 2020 March 30, 2019 March 31, 2018 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 76,743 $ 65,228 $ 31,623 Investing activities (14,093 ) (2,030 ) (8,621 ) Financing activities 21,569 (72,518 ) 10,336 Effect of exchange rate changes (1,398 ) (662 ) 586 Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash 82,821 (9,982 ) 33,924 Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash at beginning of period 126,634 136,616 102,692 Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash at end of period $ 209,455 $ 126,634 $ 136,616 The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and existing cash balances. Cash balances and cash flow from operations for the next year are expected to be adequate to cover working capital requirements, fund capital expenditures, and floor plan payment obligations. The Company does not have any scheduled long term debt maturities in the next twelve months. The Company’s revolving credit facility includes a leverage ratio covenant that requires the Company’s first lien debt levels to remain less than 2.75x consolidated trailing twelve month EBITDA. The Company anticipates compliance with its leverage ratio debt covenant and projects its level of cash availability to be in excess of cash needed to operate the business for the next year. In the event operating cash flow and existing cash balances were deemed inadequate to support the Company’s liquidity needs, and one or more capital resources were to become unavailable, the Company would revise operating strategies accordingly. Cash provided by operating activities was $76.7 million in fiscal 2020 compared to $65.2 million in fiscal 2019. Cash was generated by operating income (before non-cash charges) from higher sales and operating margins compared to the prior year. Additionally, there were no transaction expenses incurred for the Skyline acquisition or secondary offering costs in fiscal 2020 compared to $8.2 million in the same period of the prior year. The increase was partially offset by cash used for other working capital items. Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2019 increased to $65.2 million from $31.6 million in fiscal 2018. The increase was primarily due to an increase in operating income after adding back non-cash related expenses such as equity-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, which increased due to the Exchange with Skyline and overall operating improvement. The increase was partially offset by costs associated with the integration of the Skyline operations of $8.0 million. 38 Cash used in investing activities was $14.1 million in fiscal 2020 versus $2.0 million in 2019. The increase is primarily related to the benefit of $ 9.7 million of cash acquired in the Exchange in fiscal 2019, and an increase in capital expenditures of $3.3 million, part ially offset by proceeds of $1.1 million from the disposition of a held for sale property. The expenditures for capital items are part of the Company’s focus on safety and operating efficiency initiatives as well as the expansion of production capacity with the investment in the new Leesville, Louisiana manufacturing facility. Cash used in investing activities was $2.0 million in fiscal 2019 versus $8.6 million in 2018. The $6.6 million decrease was mainly due to the benefit of $9.7 million of cash assumed in the Exchange , offset by an increase in capital expenditures of $2.6 million. In fiscal 2020, cash provided by financing activities was $21.6 million, versus the prior year which had net cash used in financing activities of $72.5 million. The increase in cash provided by financing activities is primarily a result of the increase in net borrowings on the credit facility. Additionally, there were no capital distributions, payments of deferred financing fees, or repayments of term loans in fiscal 2020. Cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2019 was mainly related to Champion Holdings members’ capital distribution of $65.2 million, completed in conjunction with the Exchange with Skyline and a paydown on revolving debt of $5.0 million. Cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2018 was primarily the result of increased net borrowings on floor plan payables. On June 5, 2018, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of banks. The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility of up to $100.0 million, including a letter of credit sub-facility of not less than $45.0 million. Initial borrowings in fiscal 2019 under the Credit Agreement were used to repay the Company’s prior $46.9 million term loans and replace the Company’s prior cash collateralized stand-alone letter of credit facility. The interest rate on borrowing under the Credit Agreement is based on LIBOR and was 2.4% at March 28, 2020. The Company borrowed $38.0 million under the Credit Agreement in March 2020 to maximize financial flexibility in response to the impact of COVID-19. The Company had $6.4 million available to borrow against the Credit Agreement at March 28, 2020. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS The following table presents a summary of payments due by period for the Company’s contractual obligations for long-term debt and operating leases as of March 28, 2020: Payments due by period: After March 28, 2020 (1)(2) (Dollars in thousands) Total <1 Year 1 to 3 Years 3 to 5 Years >5 Years Revolving credit facility maturing in 2023 $ 64,900 $ — $ — $ 64,900 $ — Obligations under industrial revenue bonds due 2029 12,430 — — — 12,430 Operating Leases 17,171 5,411 7,791 2,198 1,771 Total $ 94,501 $ 5,411 $ 7,791 $ 67,098 $ 14,201 (1) The variable interest on outstanding debt obligations is not included in the repayment information. (2) Based on the outstanding debt obligations and variable rates in effect at March 28, 2020, the estimated annual interest expense on the revolving credit facility and industrial revenue bonds would be $2.4 million. Credit Facility The Credit Agreement matures on June 5, 2023 and has no scheduled amortization. The interest rate under the Credit Agreement will adjust based on the first lien net leverage of the Company which will range from a high of LIBOR plus 2.25% and ABR plus 1.25% when first lien net leverage is equal to or greater than 2.00:1.00, to a low of LIBOR plus 1.50% and ABR plus 0.50% when first lien net leverage is below 0.50:1.00. In addition, the Company is obligated to pay a commitment fee ranging between 0.25% and 0.40% (depending on first lien net leverage) in respect of unused commitments under the Credit Agreement. Letter of Credit Facility The Company has a letter of credit sub-facility under the Credit Agreement. At March 28, 2020, letters of credit issued under the sub-facility totaled $28.7 million. 39 Industrial Revenue Bonds Obligations under industrial revenue bonds are supported by letters of credit and bear interest based on a municipal bond index rate. The industrial revenue bonds require lump-sum payments of principal upon maturity in 2029. Floor Plan Payable At March 28, 2020, the Company had outstanding borrowings on floor plan financing arrangements of $33.9 million. The Company’s retail operations utilize floor plan financing to fund the acquisition of manufactured homes for display or resale. The arrangements provide for borrowings up to $48.0 million. Borrowings are secured by the homes acquired and are required to be repaid when the Company sells the financed home to a customer. Contingent Obligations The Company has contingent liabilities and obligations at March 28, 2020, including surety bonds and letters of credit totaling $23.6 million and $28.7 million, respectively. Additionally, the Company is contingently obligated under repurchase agreements with certain lending institutions that provide floor plan financing to independent retailers. The contingent repurchase obligation as of March 28, 2020 is approximately $152.7 million, without reduction for the resale value of the homes. The impact of COVID-19 may have an adverse impact on the solvency of independent industry retailers and, as a result, the Company may experience higher levels of repurchase commitments if the retailers default under terms of the floor plan financing arrangements. The Company has the ability to resell the repurchased collateral to other retailers, and losses incurred on repurchased homes have been insignificant in recent periods. The reserve for estimated losses under repurchase agreements was $1.0 million at March 28, 2020. See “ Critical Accounting Polices – Reserve for Repurchase Commitments ” below. The Company has provided various representations, warranties, and other standard indemnifications in the ordinary course of its business in agreements to acquire and sell business assets and in financing arrangements. The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of its business. In the normal course of business, the Company’s subsidiaries historically provided certain parent company guarantees to two U.K. customers. These guarantees provided contractual liability for proven construction defects up to 12 years from the date of delivery of the units. The guarantees remain a contingent liability subsequent to the fiscal 2017 disposition of the U.K. operations, which declines over time through October 2027. As of the date of this report, no claims have been reported under the terms of the guarantees. Management believes the ultimate liability with respect to these contingent obligations will not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES - ADJUSTED EBITDA The Company defines Adjusted Earnings Before Interest Taxes and Depreciation and Amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA ”) as net income or loss plus; (a) the provision for income taxes; (b) interest expense, net; (c) depreciation and amortization; (d) gain or loss from discontinued operations; (e) foreign currency gains and losses; (f) equity based compensation awards granted prior to December 31, 2018; (g) non-cash restructuring charges and impairment of assets; and (h) other non-operating costs including those for the acquisition and integration or disposition of businesses and idle facilities. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of earnings calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income or loss prepared on a U.S. GAAP basis. Adjusted EBITDA does not purport to represent cash flow provided by, or used in, operating activities as defined by U.S. GAAP, which is presented in the Statement of Cash Flows. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is presented as a supplemental measure of the Company’s financial performance that management believes is useful to investors, because the excluded items may vary significantly in timing or amounts and/or may obscure trends useful in evaluating and comparing the Company’s operating activities across reporting periods. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA is useful to an investor in evaluating operating performance for the following reasons: (i) Adjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors to measure a company’s operating performance without regard to items such as interest income and expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization and equity-based compensation, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and the book value of assets, capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired; and (ii) analysts and investors use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to evaluate the overall operating performance of companies in the industry. 40 Management uses Adjusted EBITDA f or planning purposes, including the preparation of internal annual operating budget and periodic forecasts : (i) in communications with the board of directo rs and investors concerning financial performance; (ii) as a factor in determining bonuses under management’s annual incentive compensation program; and (iii) as a measure of operating performance used to determine the ability to provide cash flows to support investments in capital assets, acquisitions and working capital requirements for operating expansion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1, ""Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,"" to the consolidated financial statements included in this Report. Certain of our accounting policies require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Assumptions and estimates of future earnings and cash flow are used in the periodic analyses of the recoverability of goodwill, intangible assets, deferred tax assets and property, plant, and equipment. Historical experience and trends are used to estimate reserves, including reserves for self-insured risks, warranty costs, and wholesale repurchase losses. The Company considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the estimate would have had a significant impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. The Company believes that the following discussion addresses the Company’s critical accounting estimates. Acquisitions We allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the assets and liabilities, if any, is recorded as goodwill. We use all available information to estimate fair values. We typically engage outside appraisal firms to assist in the fair value determination of identifiable intangible assets and any other significant assets or liabilities. We adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation, as necessary, up to one year after the acquisition closing date as we obtain more information regarding asset valuations and liabilities assumed. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but that are inherently uncertain, and therefore, may not be realized. Unanticipated events or circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy of our fair value estimates, including assumptions regarding industry economic factors and business strategies. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the estimates, assumptions, and values reflected in the valuations will be realized, and actual results could vary materially. Reserves for Self-Insured Risks The Company is self-insured for a significant portion of its general insurance, product liability, workers’ compensation, auto, health, and property insurance. Insurance coverage is maintained for catastrophic exposures and those risks required to be insured by law. The Company is liable for the first $150,000 of incurred losses for each workers’ compensation and auto liability claim and is responsible for losses up to the first $500,000 per occurrence for general, product liability, and property insurance. Generally catastrophic losses are insured up to $100 million. The health plan is subject to a stop-loss limit of $300,000 per occurrence. Estimated self-insurance costs are accrued for all expected future expenditures for reported and unreported claims based on historical experience. Warranty Reserves The Company’s factory-built housing operations generally provide each retail homebuyer or builder/developer with a 12-month assurance warranty from the date of retail purchase. Estimated warranty costs are accrued as cost of sales at the time of sale. Warranty provisions and reserves are based on various factors, including estimates of the amounts necessary to settle existing and future claims on homes sold as of the balance sheet date. Factors used in the estimation of the warranty liability include the estimated amount of warranty and customer service costs incurred for homes that remain in retailers’ inventories before delivery to the consumer, homes purchased by consumers still within the warranty period, the timing in which work orders were completed, and the historical average costs incurred to service a home. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets It is the Company’s policy to evaluate the recoverability of property, plant, and equipment whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable, primarily based on estimated selling price, appraised value, or projected undiscounted future cash flows. 41 Impairment of Goodwill Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually. Impairment testing is required more often if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment is more likely than not to have occurred. In conducting its annual impairment testing, the Company may first perform a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount. If not, no further goodwill impairment testing is required. If it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount, or if the Company elects not to perform a qualitative assessment of a reporting unit, the Company then compares the fair value of the reporting unit to the related net book value. If the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is measured and recognized. As the analysis depends upon judgments, estimates and assumptions, such testing is subject to inherent uncertainties, which could cause the fair value to fluctuate from period to period. In fiscal 2020, the Company performed qualitative assessments of its reporting units. The annual assessment was completed on of the first day of March and an additional assessment was performed the last day of the fiscal year due to a decrease in the Company’s share price and in response to the changes in business operating conditions from COVID-19. The assessments indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded its respective carrying value. The Company does not believe that any reporting units are at risk for impairment. Income Taxes and Deferred Tax Assets Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided when the Company determines that it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Reserve for Repurchase Commitments As is customary in the factory-built housing industry, a significant portion of the manufacturing operations’ sales to independent retailers are made pursuant to repurchase agreements with lending institutions that provide wholesale floor plan financing to the retailers. Certain homes sold pursuant to repurchase agreements are subject to repurchase, generally up to 24 months after the sale of the home to the retailer. Certain other homes sold pursuant to repurchase agreements are subject to repurchase until the home is sold by the retailer. For those homes with an unlimited repurchase period, the Company’s risk of loss upon repurchase declines due to required monthly principal payments by the retailer. After 24 or 30 months from the date of the Company’s sale of the home, the risk of loss on these homes is low, and by the 46th month, most programs require that the home be paid in full, at which time the Company no longer has risk of loss. Pursuant to these agreements, during the repurchase period, generally upon default by the retailer and repossession by the financial institution, the Company is obligated to repurchase the homes from the Floor Plan Lender. The contingent repurchase obligation as of March 28, 2020, is estimated to be approximately $152.7 million, without reduction for the resale value of the homes. Losses under repurchase obligations represent the difference between the repurchase price and net proceeds from the resale of the homes, less accrued rebates, which will not be paid. Losses incurred on homes repurchased have been insignificant in recent periods. The reserve for estimated losses under repurchase agreements was $1.0 million at March 28, 2020. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Off balance sheet arrangements at March 28, 2020 consist of the contingent repurchase obligation totaling approximately $152.7 million, letters of credit totaling $28.7 million, and surety bonds totaling $23.6 million. See “Contractual Obligations and Commitments – Contingent Obligations” and “Critical Accounting Policies – Reserve for Repurchase Commitments” above for more information related to these off balance sheet arrangements. OTHER MATTERS Inflation Inflation has not had a material effect on profitability during the past three years. Commodity prices, including lumber, have fluctuated in recent years, but increases have generally been passed on to customers or mitigated through working with supply chain partners. However, sudden increases in specific costs, as well as price competition, can affect the ability to pass on costs and adversely impact results of operations. Therefore, there is no assurance that inflation or the impact of rising material costs will not have a significant impact on revenue or results of operations in the future. Seasonality The housing industry is affected by seasonality, which includes factory-built homes. Sales during the period from March to November are traditionally higher than other months. As a result, quarterly results of a particular period are not necessarily representative of the results expected for the year. 42 Recently Issued Accounting Standards Refer to Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” in our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding new accounting pronouncements. 43 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Risk Debt obligations under the Credit Agreement are subject to variable rates of interest based on LIBOR, the administrative agent’s prime rate or the U.S. federal funds rate. A 100 basis point increase in the underlying interest rate would result in an additional annual interest expense of approximately $0.6 million, assuming related debt of $64.9 million, which is the amount of outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement at March 28, 2020. Obligations under industrial revenue bonds are subject to variable rates of interest based on a municipal bond index rate. A 100 basis point increase in the underlying interest rates would result in additional annual interest expense of approximately $0.1 million, assuming related debt of $12.4 million, which is the amount of outstanding borrowings on industrial revenue bonds at March 28, 2020. Obligations under floor plan financing arrangements are subject to variable rates of interest based on terms negotiated with the floor plan lenders. A 100 basis point increase in the underlying interest rates would result in additional annual interest expense of approximately $0.3 million, assuming related floor plan borrowings of $33.9 million, which is the amount of outstanding borrowings on floor plan financing at March 28, 2020. The Company’s approach to interest rate risk is to balance borrowings between fixed rate and variable rate debt as management deems appropriate. At March 28, 2020, the Company’s borrowings under the Credit Agreement, industrial revenue bonds and floor plan financing arrangements are all at variable rates. Foreign Exchange Risk The Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk with its factory-built housing operations in Canada. The Canadian operations had fiscal 2020 net sales of $111.8 million Canadian dollars. Assuming future annual Canadian net sales equivalent to fiscal 2020, a change of 1.0% in exchange rates between the U.S. and Canadian dollars would change consolidated sales by $1.1 million. The Company also has foreign exchange risk for cash balances maintained in Canadian dollars that are subject to fluctuating values when exchanged into U.S. dollars. The Company does not financially hedge its investment in the Canadian operations or in Canadian denominated bank deposits. ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Financial statements and supplementary data are filed herewith under Item 15. ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company’s management, with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of March 28, 2020. Based on that evaluation, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 28, 2020. 44 (b) Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. As part of the integration of certain business and corporate activities from the Exchange, the Company instituted changes to systems and processes to expand controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that an effective internal control environment was maintained across the organization. Changes included such activities as implementing additional processes, automating manual processes, standardizing controls, and increasing monitoring controls. Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on the Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of March 28, 2020. Given their inherent limitations, the Company's controls and procedures may not prevent or detect misstatements. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met. In light of the inherent limitations in all controls systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. (c) Attestation Report of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Ernst & Young LLP, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, audited the Company’s consolidated financial statements set forth in this Annual Report and issued an attestation report regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of March 28, 2020, and the attestation report is set forth in Item 15, ""Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,"" under the caption ""Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control over Financial Reporting"" and is incorporated herein by reference. (d) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting Other than as described above, there were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended March 28, 2020 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at March 28, 2020 and March 30, 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the fiscal years ended March 28, 2020, March 30, 2019, and March 31, 2018, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of March 28, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated May 21, 2020, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts and disclosures to which it relates. Workers’ Compensation Reserve Description of the Matter The Company had workers’ compensation reserves of $20.5 million as of March 28, 2020. As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company is self-insured for a significant portion of its workers’ compensation obligations. Workers’ compensation costs are accrued for incurred claims and estimated claims incurred but not yet reported. Auditing the Company’s workers’ compensation reserve is complex and required the involvement of actuarial specialists due to the measurement uncertainty associated with the estimate of the ultimate loss projection and the use of various actuarial methods. F-1 How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company’s controls over the workers’ compensation reserve process. For example, we tested controls over management’s review of the workers’ compensation reserve calculations, the appropriateness of the assumptions management used in the calculation and controls pertaining to the completeness and accuracy of the claim data underlying the reserve. To evaluate the reserve for workers’ compensation, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, testing the completeness and accuracy of the incurred claims underlying the reserve, obtaining legal confirmation letters to evaluate reserves in consideration of litigated matters, and reviewing the Company’s reinsurance contracts to assess the Company’s self-insurance retentions. Furthermore, we involved our actuarial specialists to assist in our evaluation of methodologies and assumptions applied by management to establish the workers’ compensation reserve. We compared the Company’s reserve to a range developed by our actuarial specialists based on assumptions independently developed by our specialists. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2006. Detroit, Michigan May 21, 2020 F-2 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Skyline Champion Corporation Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have audited Skyline Champion Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of March 28, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Skyline Champion Corporation (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 28, 2020, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of March 28, 2020 and March 30, 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive (loss) income, equity and cash flows for each of the fiscal years ended March 28, 2020, March 30, 2019, and March 31, 2018, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) and our report dated May 21, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP Detroit, Michigan May 21, 2020 F-3 Skyline Champion Corporation Consolidated Balance Sheets (Dollars and shares in thousands, except per share amounts) March 28, 2020 March 30, 2019 ASSETS Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 209,455 $ 126,634 Trade accounts receivable, net 45,733 57,649 Inventories, net 126,386 122,638 Other current assets 17,239 11,369 Total current assets 398,813 318,290 Long-term assets: Property, plant, and equipment, net 109,291 108,587 Goodwill 173,521 173,406 Amortizable intangible assets, net 43,357 48,936 Deferred tax assets 21,812 34,058 Other noncurrent assets 34,906 16,677 Total assets $ 781,700 $ 699,954 LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY Current liabilities: Floor plan payable $ 33,914 $ 33,321 Accounts payable 38,703 43,421 Other current liabilities 114,030 129,561 Total current liabilities 186,647 206,303 Long-term liabilities: Long-term debt 77,330 54,330 Deferred tax liabilities 3,264 3,422 Other 40,144 23,927 Total long-term liabilities 120,738 81,679 Stockholders' Equity: Common stock, $ 0.0277 par value, 115,000 shares authorized, 56,665 and 56,657 shares issued (including 145 and 290 shares subject to restriction) as of March 28, 2020 and March 30, 2019, respectively 1,570 1,569 Additional paid-in capital 485,552 479,226 Accumulated deficit ( 48 ) ( 58,208 ) Accumulated other comprehensive loss ( 12,759 ) ( 10,615 ) Total equity 474,315 411,972 Total liabilities and stockholders' equity $ 781,700 $ 699,954 See accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

As a result, the financial results for the twelve months ending March 30, 2019 are comprised of: (i) the results of Champion Holdings for the period between April 1, 2018 and May 31, 2018; and (ii) the Company, after giving effect to the Exchange, from June 1, 2018 through March 30, 2019. All annual periods presented prior to the effective date of the Exchange are comprised solely of the results of Champion Holdings and all annual periods presented subsequent to the period ending March 30, 2019 are comprised solely of the results of the Company. All Company earnings per share and common stock outstanding amounts in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been calculated as if the Shares Issuance took place on April 2, 2017, at the exchange ratio, as defined in the Exchange Agreement. Nature of Operations: The Company’s operations consist of manufacturing, retail and transportation activities. At March 28, 2020, the Company operated 33 manufacturing facilities throughout the United States (“U.S.”) and five manufacturing facilities in western Canada that primarily construct factory-built, timber-framed manufactured and modular houses that are sold primarily to independent retailers, builders/developers, and manufactured home community operators. The Company’s retail operations consist of 21 sales centers that sell manufactured houses to consumers primarily in the Southern U.S. The Company’s transportation business engages independent owners/drivers to transport recreational vehicles throughout the U.S. and Canada and manufactured houses in certain regions of the U.S. The Company also has holding companies located in the Netherlands. Principles of Consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, its wholly owned subsidiaries, and its majority-owned subsidiaries which it controls. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Variable Interest Entities and Joint Ventures : The Company analyzes its investments in non-wholly owned subsidiaries to determine whether they are unconsolidated joint ventures, consolidated joint ventures, or variable interest entities (“VIEs”) and, if so, whether the Company is the primary beneficiary in accordance with ASC 810, Consolidation . The Company has a 90 % equity interest in a consolidated joint venture that was formed in March 2012 to acquire and develop land into a subdivision of modular homes to be sold to homebuyers. The Company is responsible for the development of the subdivision and marketing the lots for sale, and to provide, install, and set up modular homes on the lots. The Company recorded an impairment charge of $ 1.2 million during fiscal 2018 to reflect the net realizable value of development inventory. The net investment in development inventory was zero for all periods presented. Accounting Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“US. GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto. Estimates made in preparing the accompanying consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, business combinations, reserves for obsolete inventory, accrued warranty costs, useful lives of fixed and intangible assets, asset impairment analyses, insurance reserves, legal reserves, repurchase reserves, share-based compensation and deferred tax valuation allowances. There is significant uncertainty regarding the extent and duration of the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on the demand for our products and our supply chain. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain, including new information that may emerge F-9 concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions taken to contain it or treat its impac t s . Actual results could differ from those estimates, making it reasonably possible that a change in these estimates could occur within one year. Fiscal Year: The Company’s fiscal year is a 52- or 53-week period that ends on the Saturday nearest March 31. Fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 include the 52-weeks ended March 28, 2020, March 30, 2019, and March 31, 2018, respectively . Revenue Recognition: Revenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of a contract are satisfied which generally occurs at a point in time through the transfer of control of promised goods to the Company's customers. Control transfers once a customer has the ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the benefits from, the product. This includes the transfer of legal title, physical possession, the risks and rewards of ownership, and customer acceptance. Sales revenue is reported net of applicable sales tax. See Note 10, Revenue Recognition, for additional information. Cost of Sales: Cost of sales includes manufacturing costs such as: (i) materials; (ii) compensation and employee benefits for direct and indirect labor; (iii) fixed and variable manufacturing overhead costs; (iv) warranty costs; (v) inbound delivery costs; and (vi) depreciation of buildings and equipment. Manufacturing overhead costs include costs such as: (i) utilities; (ii) workers’ compensation and product liability self-insurance; (iii) real and personal property taxes on buildings and equipment; (iv) manufacturing supplies; (v) repairs and maintenance; and (vi) rents and leases for buildings and equipment. Cost of sales also includes certain post-manufacturing costs, to the extent such costs are the Company’s responsibility. Post-manufacturing costs may include delivery and setup, foundations, craning, roofing, exterior cladding, interior finishing, utility connections and other miscellaneous site costs. Generally, subcontractors are engaged to perform post-manufacturing activities. Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses: Selling, general, and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) include costs such as (i) salaries, wages, incentives and employee benefits for executive, management, sales, engineering, accounting, information technology (“IT”) and administrative employees; (ii) sales commissions; (iii) marketing and advertising costs; (iv) legal and professional fees; (v) depreciation, rents and leases for administrative facilities, office equipment, IT equipment and computer software; and (vi) postage, office supplies, travel and telephone expenses. Advertising Costs and Delivery Costs and Revenue : Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and are included in selling, general, and administrative expenses. Total advertising expense was approximately $ 2.3 million, $ 1.5 million, and $ 1.0 million for fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Delivery costs are included in cost of sales and delivery revenue is included in net sales. Foreign Currency: The Company had intercompany loans between its U.S. and foreign subsidiaries for financing purposes. The foreign exchange impact on these transactions was reported in the consolidated statements of operations under foreign currency transaction gains and losses. Translation adjustments of the Company’s international subsidiaries for which the local currency is the functional currency are reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. Fair Value: The Company estimates the fair value of its financial instruments in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measuremen t , which establishes a fair value hierarchy and requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. As such, the fair value of financial instruments is estimated using available market information and other valuation methods. The Company groups assets and liabilities at fair value in three levels, based on the inputs and assumptions used to determine fair value. These levels are: • Level 1—Fair value determined based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. • Level 2—Fair value determined using significant observable inputs, generally either quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities or quoted prices in markets that are not active. • Level 3—Fair value determined using significant observable inputs, such as pricing models, discounted cash flows, or similar techniques. The Company records accounts receivable, accounts payable and other current liabilities at cost. The carrying value of these instruments approximate their fair value due to their short-term maturities. F-10 Cash and Cash Equivalents : Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments that have original maturities less than 90 days at the time of their purchase. These investments are carried at cost, which approximates market value because of their short maturities. Restricted Cash: Restricted cash primarily represented collateral for letters of credit issued to support industrial revenue bonds, repurchase obligations, self-insurance programs and bonding facilities prior to the Exchange. Trade Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: The Company extends credit terms on a customer-by-customer basis in the normal course of business and, as such, trade accounts receivable are subject to customary credit risk. The allowance for doubtful accounts represents the Company's best estimate of probable credit losses in accounts receivable. Receivables are written off against the allowance when management believes that the amount receivable will not be recovered. At March 28 , 2020 and March 30, 2019, the Company had an allowance for doubtful accounts of $ 0.4 million and $ 0.6 million, respectively. Inventories : Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost determined under the first-in, first-out method. Capitalized manufacturing costs include the cost of materials, labor and manufacturing overhead. Retail inventories of new manufactured homes built by the Company are valued at manufacturing cost, including materials, labor and manufacturing overhead, or net purchase price if acquired from unaffiliated third parties. Property, Plant, and Equipment : Property, plant, and equipment are stated at acquisition date cost. Depreciation is provided principally on the straight-line method, generally over the following estimated useful lives: land improvements— 3 to 10 years ; buildings and improvements— 8 to 25 years ; and vehicles and machinery and equipment— 3 to 8 years . Depreciation expense was $ 13.1 million, $ 11.3 million, and $ 7.8 million for fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. At March 28, 2020, the Company owned five idle manufacturing facilities and two idle retail sales centers with a net book value of $ 8.5 million. These properties are accounted for as long-lived assets to be held and used. It is the Company’s policy to evaluate the recoverability of property, plant, and equipment whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable. If impairment indicators exist, the Company performs the required impairment analysis by comparing the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the long-lived assets to the related net book values. If the net book value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is measured and recognized. An impairment loss is measured as the difference between the net book value and the fair value of the long-lived assets. Fair value is estimated based upon a combination of market and cost approaches, as appropriate. An impairment loss of $ 0.6 million was recorded in selling, general, and administrative expenses in fiscal 2020 related to a decrease in the estimated fair value of the Company’s idle manufacturing facilities. No impairment losses were recorded in fiscal 2019 or 2018. Assets held for sale: Long-lived assets expected to be sold or otherwise disposed of within one year are classified as assets held for sale and included in other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets. In connection with the Exchange, the Company acquired an office building which was classified as an asset held for sale as of March 30, 2019, valued at $ 2.1 million. In the first quarter of fiscal 2020, a loss of $ 1.0 million was recorded in selling, general, and administrative expenses to recognize a decrease in the fair value of the building, which was sold for $ 1.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2020. Goodwill : The Company tests goodwill for impairment in accordance with ASC 350. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment on at least an annual basis. Impairment testing is required more often than annually if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment is more likely than not to have occurred. In conducting its annual impairment testing, the Company may first perform a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount. If not, no further goodwill impairment testing is required. If it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount, or if the Company elects not to perform a qualitative assessment of a reporting unit, the Company then compares the fair value of the reporting unit to the related net book value. If the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is measured and recognized. In fiscal 2020, the Company performed qualitative assessments of its reporting units. The annual assessment was completed on of the first day of March and an additional assessment was performed the last day of the fiscal year due to a drop in the share price and in response to the changes in business operating conditions from the COVID-19 pandemic. The assessments indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded its respective carrying value. The Company does not believe that any reporting units are at risk for impairment. F-11 Business combinations: The Company accounts for its business combinations in accordance with the accounting guidance in ASC 805. The purchase price of an acquired business is allocated to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the assets and liabilities, if any, is recorded as goodwill. Determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management’s judgment, the utilization of independent appraisal firms and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the timing and amount of future cash flows, market rate assumptions, actuarial assumptions, and appropriate discount rates, among other items. Refer to Note 2, Business Combination and Acquisition, for additional information. Amortizable Intangible Assets : Amortizable intangible assets consist primarily of fair values assigned to customer relationships and trade names. Trade names were valued based upon the royalty-saving method and customer relationships were valued based upon the excess earnings method. Amortization is provided over the useful lives of the intangible assets, generally up to ten years , using the straight-line method. The recoverability of amortizable intangible assets is evaluated whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recovered, in accordance with the recognition and measurement provisions of ASC 360. Warranty Obligations : The Company’s manufactured housing operations generally provides the homebuyer with an assurance warranty from the date of respective purchase. Estimated warranty costs are accrued as cost of sales at the time of sale. Warranty provisions and reserves are based on estimates of the amounts necessary to settle existing and future claims on homes sold by the manufacturing segment as of the balance sheet date. Factors used to calculate the warranty obligation are the estimated number of homes still under warranty and the historical average costs incurred to service a home. Dealer Volume Rebates : The Company’s manufacturing segment sponsors volume rebate programs under which sales to retailers and builder/developers can qualify for cash rebates generally based on the level of sales attained during a twelve-month period. Volume rebates are accrued at the time of sale and are recorded as a reduction of net sales. Repurchase Agreements: The Company is contingently liable under terms of repurchase agreements with lending institutions that provide wholesale floor plan financing to retailers. These arrangements, which are customary in the industry, provide for the repurchase of products sold to retailers in the event of default by the retailer on their agreement to pay the financial institution. The risk of loss from these agreements is spread over numerous retailers. The repurchase price is generally determined by the original sales price of the product less contractually defined curtailment payments. The Company accounts for the guarantee under its repurchase agreements with the retailers’ financing institutions by estimating and deferring a portion of the related product sale that represents the estimated fair value of the guarantee. Accrued Self-Insurance : The Company is self-insured for a significant portion of its workers’ compensation, general and product liability, auto liability, health, and property insurance. Insurance coverage is maintained for catastrophic exposures and those risks required to be insured by law. Estimated self-insurance costs are accrued for incurred claims and estimated claims incurred but not yet reported. At March 28, 2020 and March 30, 2019, the Company had gross reserves for estimated losses under its workers’ compensation programs of $ 20.5 million and $ 20.4 million, respectively. The Company also recorded expected reimbursements for the portion of those losses above respective program limits of $ 9.3 million and $ 8.2 million at March 28, 2020 and March 30, 2019. Equity-Based Compensation: Stock-based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is generally recognized as expense ratably on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. Forfeitures are recognized in the period in which they occur. Comprehensive Income and Loss: Components of comprehensive income and loss are changes in equity other than those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners. The aggregate amount of such changes to equity that have not yet been recognized in net income or loss are reported in the equity section of the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, net of tax. F-12 Income Taxes : The provision for income taxes is calculated using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent upon the generation of future taxable income. In determining the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns, judgment is required. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements: In May 2014, FASB issued an amendment on revenue recognition. The amendment created Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, (“ASC 606”) and supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition , including most industry-specific revenue recognition guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification. In addition, the amendment supersedes the cost guidance in Subtopic 605-35, Revenue Recognition - Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts , and created new Subtopic 340-40, Other Assets and Deferred Costs - Contracts with Customers . Under ASC 606 an entity recognizes revenue in a manner that reflects the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. On April 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASC 606 using the modified retrospective method as applied to customer contracts that were not completed as of March 31, 2018. As a result, financial information for reporting periods beginning after March 31, 2018, are presented in accordance with ASC 606 while prior reporting periods were not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with the Company’s revenue recognition policies prior to the adoption of ASC 606. There was no material impact to revenues as a result of applying ASC 606 for the fiscal year ended March 30, 2019 and the post-adoption effects to the Company’s business processes, systems or internal controls were not significant. On April 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2016-18, Restricted Cash . The standard requires that changes in restricted cash be reflected with changes in cash and cash equivalents on the statement of cash flows and that a reconciliation between cash and cash equivalents presented on the balance sheet and cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash presented on the statement of cash flows be provided. The provisions of the standard were applied retrospectively, and the effects of adoption were not significant. In February 2016, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (“ASC 842”), to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. A lessee should recognize in the consolidated balance sheet a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and an asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee have not significantly changed from previous requirements. This ASC 842 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2018 and modified retrospective application is permitted. The Company adopted ASC 842 as of March 31, 2019, the first day of fiscal 2020 using the modified retrospective approach and without restating comparative periods. The Company has elected to apply the transition package of three practical expedients which allow companies not to reassess whether agreements contain leases, the classification of leases, and the capitalization of initial direct costs. The Company did not elect the practical expedient which permits the use of hindsight when determining the lease term and assessing right-of-use assets for impairment. As permitted by the standard, the Company elected to: (i) recognize lease expense for leases with a term of 12 months or less on a straight-line basis over the lease term and will not recognize any right of use assets or lease liabilities for those leases, and (ii) not separate lease and non-lease components. The primary financial statement impact upon adoption was the recognition, on a discounted basis, of the Company's minimum commitments under non-cancelable operating leases as right of use assets and obligations on the consolidated balance sheets. The adoption of ASC 842 resulted in the recognition of lease-related assets and liabilities of $ 13.7 million. The standard did not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations or cash flows. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Pending Adoption: In January 2017, FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment . The standard simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairments and allows a goodwill impairment charge to be based on the amount of a reporting unit’s carrying value in excess of its fair value. This eliminates the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill or what is known as “Step 2” under the current guidance. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods of public entities beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. In June 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, as amended . The amendments in this update require measurement of impairment of all financial instruments including accounts receivable, long-term notes receivable, and financial guarantees based on current conditions and forward-looking information, rather than historical experience. The new methodology may result in earlier recognition of credit losses compared to the current standard. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company does not expect that the adoption of the standard will have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. F-13 There were no other accounting standards recently issued that are expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations. 2. Business Combination Skyline Corporation Transaction The Exchange between Champion Holdings and Skyline was completed on June 1, 2018 and was accounted for as a reverse acquisition under the acquisition method of accounting as provided by ASC 805. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed as a result of the Exchange were recorded at their respective fair values and added to the carrying value of Champion Holdings’ existing assets and liabilities. The Company incurred Exchange transaction-related costs of approximately $ 6.9 million and $ 7.2 million for fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively, which were recorded as incurred and have been classified as other expense in the consolidated statements of operations. No Exchange transaction-related expenses were recorded in fiscal 2020. Additionally, the Company incurred approximately $ 6.0 million in stock compensation expense related to former Skyline employees during fiscal 2019, which is recorded in SG&A in the consolidated statements of operations. The purchase price of the acquisition was determined with reference to the value of equity (common stock) of the Company based on the closing price on June 1, 2018 of $ 33.39 per share. The purchase price has been allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed using their estimated fair values at June 1, 2018, the closing of the Exchange. The purchase price and the allocation have been used to prepare the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The final allocation of the purchase price was as follows: (Dollars in thousands) Cash $ 9,722 Trade accounts receivable 13,876 Inventory 19,028 Assets held for sale 2,086 Property, plant, and equipment 40,220 Deferred tax assets, net 7,034 Other assets 6,706 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities ( 36,027 ) Intangibles 52,065 Goodwill 170,342 Total purchase price allocation $ 285,052 Goodwill is primarily attributable to expected synergies from the combination of the companies, including, but not limited to, expected cost synergies through procurement activities and operational improvements through sharing of best practices. Goodwill, which is not deductible for income tax purposes, was allocated to the U.S. Factory-built Housing reporting unit. Cash, trade accounts receivable, other assets, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities were generally stated at historical carrying values given the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities. Intangible assets consist primarily of amounts recognized for the fair value of customer relationships and trade names and were based on an independent appraisal. Customer-based assets include the Company’s established relationships with its customers and the ability of those customers to generate future economic profits for the Company. The Company estimates that these intangible assets have a weighted average useful life of ten years from the acquisition date. Fair value estimates of plant, property, and equipment were based on independent appraisals and broker opinions of value, giving consideration to the highest and best use of the assets. Key assumptions used in the appraisals were based on a combination of market and cost approaches, as appropriate. Level 3 fair value estimates of $ 40.2 million related to property, plant, and equipment and $ 52.1 million related to intangible assets were recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of March 28, 2020. The Company determined $ 2.1 million of property acquired met the definition of held for sale and is classified in other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at March 30, 2019. In the first quarter of fiscal 2020, a loss of $ 1.0 million was recorded related to this held-for-sale property based on market information. The property was sold in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 for $ 1.1 million. For further information on acquired assets measured at fair value, see Note 7, Goodwill and Intangible Assets. The Company allocated a portion of the purchase price to certain realizable deferred tax assets totaling $ 27.3 million. Deferred tax assets are primarily federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and credits offset by a valuation allowance for certain state F-14 net operating loss carryforwards that are not expected to be realized. The deferred tax assets are offset by deferred tax liabilities of $ 20.3 million resulting from the purchase price allocation step-up in fair value that exceed the historical tax basis . The statement of operations for fiscal 2019 includes $ 218.8 million of net sales attributable to the acquired Skyline operations. A summary of the results of operations for the Company, on an as reported and on a pro forma basis, are as follows: Year Ended March 30, 2019 Year Ended March 31, 2018 (Dollars in thousands) Reported Pro forma Reported Pro forma Net sales $ 1,360,043 $ 1,405,847 $ 1,064,722 $ 1,297,159 Net (loss) income ( 58,208 ) ( 43,460 ) 15,800 25,655 The pro forma results are based on adding the historical results of operations of Champion and Skyline and adjusting those historical amounts for the amortization of intangibles created in the Exchange; the increase in depreciation as a result of the step-up in fair value of property, plant, and equipment; removing transaction costs directly associated with the Exchange; removing equity-based compensation expense directly resulting from the Exchange; reflecting the financing arrangements entered into in connection with the Exchange, and adjusting those items for income taxes. The pro forma disclosures do not give effect to the potential impact of current financial conditions, any anticipated synergies, operating efficiencies or cost savings that may result from the Exchange or any integration costs. The pro forma data is intended for informational purposes and is not indicative of the future results of operations. The Exchange Agreement provided that the Company was permitted to pay a capital distribution prior to completion of the Exchange to the extent it had cash in excess of debt and other debt-like items and unpaid Exchange fees and expenses. Prior to the completion of the Exchange, the Company made a capital distribution to its members equal to an aggregate of $ 65.3 million (of which $ 22.5 million was reflected as a reduction to retained earnings and $ 42.8 million was reflected as a reduction to members’ contributed capital). 3 . Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash A reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash was as follows: (Dollars in thousands) March 28, 2020 March 30, 2019 March 31, 2018 Balance sheet - cash and cash equivalents $ 209,455 $ 126,634 $ 113,731 Balance sheet - restricted cash — — 22,885 Statement of cash flows - cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash $ 209,455 $ 126,634 $ 136,616 4 . Inventories, net The components of inventory, net of reserves for obsolete inventory, were as follows: (Dollars in thousands) March 28, 2020 March 30, 2019 Raw materials $ 55,408 $ 48,531 Work in process 17,773 13,973 Finished goods and other 53,205 60,134 Total inventories, net $ 126,386 $ 122,638 At March 28, 2020 and March 30, 2019, reserves for obsolete inventory were $ 4.2 million and $ 4.1 million, respectively. F-15 5 . Property, Plant, and Equipment Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated primarily on the straight-line method, generally over the following estimated useful lives: land improvements – 3 to 10 years ; buildings and improvements – 8 to 25 years ; and vehicles and machinery and equipment – 3 to 8 years . Depreciation expense, for the fiscal years ended March 28, 2020, March 30, 2019, and March 31, 2018 was $ 13.1 million, $ 11.3 million, and $ 7.8 million, respectively. The components of property, plant, and equipment were as follows: (Dollars in thousands) March 28, 2020 March 30, 2019 Land and improvements $ 35,332 $ 34,264 Buildings and improvements 87,222 83,973 Machinery and equipment 51,239 42,476 Construction in progress 1,810 3,619 Property, plant, and equipment, at cost 175,603 164,332 Less accumulated depreciation ( 66,312 ) ( 55,745 ) Property, plant, and equipment, net $ 109,291 $ 108,587 6 . Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. At March 28, 2020 and March 30, 2019, the Company had goodwill of $ 173.5 million and $ 173.4 million, respectively. The change in the goodwill balance during the period was a result of the finalization of the purchase price allocation related to the Exchange. Goodwill is allocated to reporting units included in the U.S. Factory-built Housing segment, which include the Company’s U.S. manufacturing and retail operations. Intangible Assets The components of amortizable intangible assets were as follows: (Dollars in thousands) March 28, 2020 March 30, 2019 Customer Relationships Trade Names Total Customer Relationships Trade Names Total Gross carrying amount $ 48,370 $ 13,068 $ 61,438 $ 48,782 $ 13,173 $ 61,955 Accumulated amortization ( 13,118 ) ( 4,963 ) ( 18,081 ) ( 9,052 ) ( 3,967 ) ( 13,019 ) Amortizable intangibles, net $ 35,252 $ 8,105 $ 43,357 $ 39,730 $ 9,206 $ 48,936 Weighted average remaining amortization period, in years 7.3 6.2 7.1 8.2 7.1 8.0 The Company recognized customer relationships of $ 43.1 million and trade names of $ 9.0 million related to the Exchange. The fair value of the customer relationship intangible asset was estimated using the multi-period excess earnings method of the income approach. The fair value of the customer relationship intangible asset was determined based on estimates and assumptions of projected cash flows attributable to the acquired customer relationships, the annual attrition rate of existing customer relationships, the contributory asset charges attributable to the assets that support the customer relationships, such as: (i) net working capital; (ii) property, plant, and equipment; (iii) trade names; and (iv) workforce, with the economic life and the discount rate as determined at the time of the final valuation. The fair value of the trade names intangible asset was estimated using the relief-from-royalty method of the income approach. The fair value of the trade names intangible asset was determined based on estimates and assumptions of the expected life of the intangible asset, the royalty rate, and the discount rate that reflects the level of risk associated with the future cash flows, as determined at the time of the final valuation. F-16 Amortization of intangible assets for the fiscal years ended March 28, 2020, March 30, 2019, and March 31, 2018 was $ 5.4 million, $ 4.8 million, and $ 0.5 million respectively. Estimated amortization expense of intangible assets over the next five years is estimated to be (dollars in thousands): Fiscal 2021 $ 5,443 Fiscal 2022 5,443 Fiscal 2023 5,326 Fiscal 2024 5,278 Fiscal 2025 5,278 7 . Other Current Liabilities The components of other current liabilities were as follows: (Dollars in thousands) March 28, 2020 March 30, 2019 Customer deposits $ 22,679 $ 27,873 Accrued volume rebates 17,469 21,020 Accrued warranty obligations 19,179 17,886 Accrued compensation and payroll taxes 27,776 32,075 Accrued insurance 11,182 16,245 Other 15,745 14,462 Total other current liabilities $ 114,030 $ 129,561 8 .

Debt and Floor Plan Payable Long-term debt consisted of the following: (Dollars in thousands) March 28, 2020 March 30, 2019 Revolving credit facility maturing in 2023 $ 64,900 $ 41,900 Obligations under industrial revenue bonds due 2029 12,430 12,430 Total debt 77,330 54,330 Less current portion — — Total long-term debt $ 77,330 $ 54,330 F-17 On June 5, 2018, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of banks. The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility of up to $ 100.0 million , including a letter of credit sub-facility of not less than $ 45 million . Initial borrowings under the Credit Agreement were used to repay the Company’s $ 46.9 million term loans and replace the Company’s existing cash collateralized stand-alone letter of credit facility. During fiscal 2020 , the Company elected to repay $ 15.0 million of the outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility during the first nine months and borrowed $ 38.0 million on the revolving credit facility in March 2020 . The Credit Agreement matures on June 5, 2023 and has no scheduled amortization. The interest rate under the Credit Agreement adjusts based on the first lien net leverage of the Company. From June 5, 2018 through December 31, 2018, the annual interest rate was the selected London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus 1.75 %. Thereafter, the interest rate adjusts based on the first lien net leverage from a high of LIBOR plus 2.25 % and ABR plus 1.25 % when the first lien net leverage is equal to or greater than 2 .00:1.00, to a low of LIBOR plus 1.50 % and ABR plus 0.50 % when the first lien net leverage is below 0.50:1.00. In addition, the Company is obligated to pay an unused line fee ranging between 0.25 % and 0.40 % (depending on the first lien net leverage) in respect of unused commitments under the Credit Agreement. At March 28, 2020 the interest rate on borrowings under the Credit Agreement was 2.4 %. At March 28, 2020, letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement totaled $ 28.7 million. Total available borrowings under the Credit Agreement as of March 28, 2020 were $ 6.4 million. Also, prior to entering into the Credit Agreement, the Company provided letters of credit issued by a commercial bank under a separate stand-alone facility collateralized with restricted cash of 101 % of the issued letters of credit. Subsequent to entering into the Credit Agreement, the Company is no longer required to back letters of credit with restricted cash. Obligations under industrial revenue bonds are supported by letters of credit and bear interest based on a municipal bond index rate. The weighted-average interest rate at March 28, 2020, including related costs and fees, was 6.31 %. At March 30, 2019, the weighted-average interest rate, including related costs and fees, was 3.62 %. The industrial revenue bonds require lump-sum payments of principal upon maturity in 2029 . The Credit Agreement contains covenants that restrict the amount of additional debt, liens and certain payments, including equity buybacks, investments, dispositions, mergers and consolidations, among other restrictions as defined. The Company was in compliance with all covenants of the Credit Agreement as of March 28, 2020. Floor Plan Payable The Company’s retail operations utilize floor plan financing to fund the acquisition of manufactured homes for display or resale. At March 28, 2020 and March 30, 2019, the Company had outstanding borrowings on floor plan financing agreements of $ 33.9 million and $ 33.3 million, respectively. The financing arrangements allow for borrowings up to $ 48.0 million. Borrowings are secured by the homes and are required to be repaid when the Company sells the home to a customer. 1 0 . Revenue Recognition The Company’s revenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of a contract are satisfied which generally occurs with the transfer of control of products. The Company enters into contracts with its customers to provide manufactured homes, modular homes, park model RVs, ADUs, commercial structures and transportation services. Generally, the Company’s contracts may be terminated by the Company’s customers at any time. Historically, terminations of these contracts have been minimal. The Company receives signed sales quotes from its customers, which provide the terms for a specific home, including price. The Company also has agreements with certain customers that provide for certain variable considerations such as volume discounts that are deducted from the contract price and accrued at the time of sale. In certain situations, the Company may receive payment in advance of completion of its contractual obligations. In these situations, the arising contract liability is classified within customer deposits and receipts in excess of revenues. Following the receipt of the customer deposit, the Company typically completes its performance obligation within a twelve-month period. F-18 For sales to independent retailers and builders/developers, revenue is recognized at the point in time when wholesale floor plan financing or retailer credit approval has been received, the home has shipped and title has transferred, which occurs when the Company has satisfied its contractual obligations and the control of its products has been transferred. The Company does not have an enforceable right to payment prior to shipment. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration that the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those products. The Company’s customers pay for products received in accordance with payment terms that are customary within the industry. As is customary in the factory-built housing industry, a significant portion of the Company’s sales to independent retailers are financed under floor plan financing programs with certain third-party lenders. Floor plan financing arrangements are generally identified prior to shipment of products and payment for sales financed under floor plan programs is generally received 5 to 10 business days from the date of invoice. For retail sales to consumers from Company-owned retail sales centers, revenue is recognized when the home has been delivered, set up and accepted by the consumer, and title has transferred. The Company recognizes commercial revenue and related cost of sales for long-term construction contracts (“Commercial”) over time as performance obligations are satisfied using the percentage-of-completion method (input method). Management estimates the stage of completion on each construction project based on progress and costs incurred. Unbilled revenue on long-term construction contracts are classified as a contract asset in accounts receivable. Receipts in excess of billings are classified as contract liabilities and included in other current liabilities. At March 28, 2020 and March 30, 2019, uncollected billings related to long-term construction contracts totaled $ 1.0 million and $ 0.9 million, respectively. There was no unbilled revenue for long-term contracts at March 28, 2020 or March 30, 2019. Revenue for the Company’s transportation operations is recognized when a shipment has been delivered to its final destination. Amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling costs are included in net sales. Shipping and handling costs are accounted for as fulfillment costs and are included in cost of sales. The following tables disaggregate the Company’s revenue by sales category: Year Ended March 28, 2020 (Dollars in thousands) U.S. Factory-Built Housing Canadian Factory-built Housing Corporate/ Other Total Manufacturing and retail $ 1,218,293 $ 84,196 $ — $ 1,302,489 Commercial 8,100 — — 8,100 Transportation — — 59,141 59,141 Total $ 1,226,393 $ 84,196 $ 59,141 $ 1,369,730 Year Ended March 30, 2019 (Dollars in thousands) U.S. Factory-Built Housing Canadian Factory-built Housing Corporate/ Other Total Manufacturing and retail $ 1,166,245 $ 98,567 $ — $ 1,264,812 Commercial 11,442 — — 11,442 Transportation — — 83,789 83,789 Total $ 1,177,687 $ 98,567 $ 83,789 $ 1,360,043 Year Ended March 31, 2018 (Dollars in thousands) U.S. Factory-Built Housing Canadian Factory-built Housing Corporate/ Other Total Manufacturing and retail $ 841,354 $ 96,603 $ — $ 937,957 Commercial 19,134 — — 19,134 Transportation — — 107,631 107,631 Total $ 860,488 $ 96,603 $ 107,631 $ 1,064,722 11. Leases F-19 The Company has operating leases for land, manufacturing and office facilities, and equipment. The Company’s lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such option. The Company's leases do not contain material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease terms. Lease expense included in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of operations is shown below: (Dollars in thousands) March 28, 2020 Operating lease expense $ 5,884 Short-term lease expense 1,378 Total lease expense $ 7,262 Net rent expense was $ 6.6 million and $ 5.8 million during fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Accordingly, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate at lease commencement to determine the present value of lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is an entity-specific rate which represents the rate of interest a lessee would pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term with similar payments.

Income Taxes Pretax income (loss) for the fiscal years ended March 28, 2020, March 30, 2019, and March 31, 2018 was attributable to the following tax jurisdictions: Year Ended (Dollars in thousands) March 28, 2020 March 30, 2019 March 31, 2018 Domestic $ 76,224 $ ( 50,891 ) $ 32,470 Foreign 8,830 9,588 10,646 Income (loss) before income taxes $ 85,054 $ ( 41,303 ) $ 43,116 The income tax provision by jurisdiction for the fiscal years ended March 28, 2020, March 30, 2019, and March 31, 2018 was as follows: Year Ended (Dollars in thousands) March 28, 2020 March 30, 2019 March 31, 2018 Current: U.S. federal $ 9,360 $ 9,353 $ 10,033 Foreign 1,938 1,452 2,269 State 3,800 3,053 2,100 Total current $ 15,098 $ 13,858 $ 14,402 Deferred U.S. federal $ 5,660 $ 1,854 $ 9,694 Foreign 5,214 987 3,640 State 922 206 ( 420 ) Total deferred $ 11,796 $ 3,047 $ 12,914 Total income tax expense $ 26,894 $ 16,905 $ 27,316 F-21 Income tax expense (benefit) differs from the amount of income tax determined by applying the applicable U.S. statutory federal income tax rate to income before income taxes as a result of the following differences: Year Ended (Dollars in thousands) March 28, 2020 March 30, 2019 March 31, 2018 Tax expense (benefit) at U.S federal statutory rate $ 17,861 $ ( 8,674 ) $ 13,599 Increase (decrease) in rate resulting from: State taxes, net of U.S. federal benefit $ 4,491 $ 2,412 $ 1,083 Change in deferred tax valuation allowance 3,652 ( 986 ) ( 8,632 ) Non-deductible compensation due to Section 162(m) 1,007 2,760 — Other permanent difference 844 531 617 Deferred tax rate changes 538 928 9,115 Foreign tax rate differences 502 579 ( 413 ) Global intangible low-taxed income (""GILTI"") 339 524 — Recognition of foreign investment basis difference 25 247 12,199 Non-deductible equity-based compensation — 17,545 203 Domestic production activities deduction — — ( 970 ) Transaction costs related to the Exchange — 2,051 — Uncertain tax positions ( 643 ) ( 590 ) 23 U.S. tax credits ( 1,005 ) ( 445 ) ( 75 ) Other ( 717 ) 23 567 Total income tax expense $ 26,894 $ 16,905 $ 27,316 On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). The Tax Act made several changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, with the following changes being most impactful: (1) decreased the corporate income tax rate from 35 % to 21 %; (2) implemented a territorial tax system; (3) eliminated the Section 199 Domestic Production Activities Deduction; (4) expanded the scope of executive compensation that is subject to Section 162(m) deduction limitations and (5) allowed for immediate expensing of certain qualified property placed in service after September 27, 2017. The Tax Act subjects a U.S. shareholder to current tax on GILTI earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. The FASB Staff Q&A, Topic 740 No. 5, Accounting for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income , states that an entity can make an accounting election to either recognize deferred taxes for temporary differences expected to reverse as GILTI in future years or provide for the tax expense related to GILTI in the year the tax is incurred. The Company has elected to recognize the tax on GILTI as a period expense in the period the tax is incurred. The U.S. income tax rate for fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 is 21 %. The U.S. income tax rate for fiscal 2018 was a blended rate of 31.5 %. This rate was calculated under the guidance of Internal Revenue Service Notice 2018-38 by prorating the total annual taxable income by the amount of days in the fiscal year that the enacted 35 % rate was applicable (April 2, 2017 to December 31, 2017) and the amount of days in the fiscal year that the enacted 21 % rate was applicable (January 1, 2018 to March 31, 2018). F-22 Deferred tax assets and liabilities at March 28, 2020 and March 30, 2019 consisted of the following: (Dollars in thousands) March 28, 2020 March 30, 2019 ASSETS Intangible assets $ 9,665 $ 11,110 U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards 9,368 14,213 Warranty reserves 6,175 5,792 Employee compensation 5,665 6,326 Foreign net operating loss carryforwards 5,400 499 Self-insurance reserves 3,806 4,491 Lease assets 3,684 — State net operating loss carryforwards 2,793 4,239 Outside basis difference in domestic partnership investment 2,229 2,133 U.S. tax credit carryforwards 2,030 2,131 Inventory reserves and impairments 1,656 1,660 Dealer volume discounts 1,216 1,409 Equity-based compensation 1,156 929 Capitalized transaction costs 456 534 Foreign capital loss carryforwards 168 186 Foreign currency translation adjustments 67 9 Foreign tax basis difference in investments — 4,601 Other 1,130 648 Gross deferred tax assets $ 56,664 $ 60,910 LIABILITIES Intangible assets $ 10,711 $ 11,997 Property, plant, and equipment 8,411 7,265 Lease liabilities 3,684 — Foreign tax basis difference in investments 3,264 3,422 Other 837 297 Gross deferred tax liabilities $ 26,907 $ 22,981 Valuation allowance ( 11,209 ) ( 7,293 ) Net deferred tax assets $ 18,548 $ 30,636 Due to the ability to repatriate earnings from the foreign subsidiaries tax-free because of the Tax Act, the Company anticipates periodically repatriating the earnings of its Netherlands and Canadian subsidiaries. Prior to the enactment of the Tax Act, the Company’s policy was that all undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries were permanently reinvested except for its former U.K. subsidiaries. A deferred tax liability is recognized for income tax withholding which may be incurred upon the reversal of basis differences in investments in its foreign subsidiaries. The Company periodically evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets based on whether it is “more likely than not” that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Our evaluation considers available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit use of the existing deferred tax assets. Due to the Exchange on June 1, 2018, the Company has U.S. federal and state net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards that were generated by the pre-Exchange Skyline entities. At March 28, 2020, the Company has provided a $ 1.4 million valuation allowance for certain state NOL carryforwards. At March 28, 2020, the Company established a valuation allowance of $ 4.2 million for certain Canadian deferred tax assets. The Company maintains a valuation allowance with respect to its deferred tax assets in the Netherlands for fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018. The fiscal 2020 value of the deferred tax assets and related valuation allowance in the Netherlands was adjusted to reflect the Netherlands statutory tax rate decrease from 25.0 % to 21.7 % expected in 2021. As of March 28, 2020, the Company has U.S. federal NOL carryforwards of $ 44.6 million, which expire in 2032 through 2035 . The Company also has state NOL carryforwards in various jurisdictions which expire primarily in 2020 through 2040 . F-23 Unrecognized tax benefits represent the differences between tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return and the benefits recognized for financial statement purposes. The Company’s total unrecognized tax benefits were $ 0.6 million at March 30, 2019. There were no unrecognized tax benefits at March 28, 2020. The Company classifies interest and penalties on income tax uncertainties as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and penalties as of March 28, 2020 and March 30, 2019, were not significant. The following table provides the changes in unrecognized tax benefits at March 28, 2020 and March 30, 2019: (Dollars in thousands) March 28, 2020 March 30, 2019 Unrecognized tax benefits, beginning of period $ 643 $ 1,246 Increase related to tax positions taken during a prior period — 44 Reductions as a result of a lapse of the applicable statute of limitations ( 643 ) ( 647 ) Unrecognized tax benefits, end of period $ — $ 643 The Company estimates no material changes to uncertain tax benefits in the next twelve months. T he Company is no longer subject to foreign tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to fiscal 2016. The Company’s U.S. subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal tax examinations for fiscal 2018 through fiscal 2020, and U.S. state tax examinations by tax authorities for fiscal 2017 through fiscal 2020. In October 2018, the Company received a notice of examination from the Internal Revenue Service for the Company’s federal income tax return for the fiscal year ended April 1, 2017. This examination was closed in February 2020 with no audit adjustments. 1 3 . Equity-Based Compensation The Company has equity incentive plans under which the Company has been authorized to grant share-based awards to key employees and non-employee directors. Equity-based compensation expense of $ 8.3 million, $ 102.0 million, and $ 0.6 million was recognized in fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Included in equity-based compensation in fiscal 2019 is $ 6.0 million of expense related to former Skyline employees that vested in conjunction with the Exchange. Equity-based compensation expense was included in SG&A expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. The total associated income tax benefit recognized was $ 1.3 million and $ 0.2 million in fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. There was no tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2018. Total unrecognized equity-based compensation for all share-based payment plans was $ 9.4 million at March 28, 2020, of which $ 5.0 million will be recognized in fiscal 2021, $ 2.8 million in fiscal 2022 and $ 1.6 million thereafter, or a weighted-average period of 1.16 years. F-24 Time-Vesting and Performance-Vesting Restricted Share Awards Champion Holdings granted awards to its officers, management employees, and certain members of the Board of Managers under an equity-classified management incentive plan (the “MIP”). In accordance with the provisions of the MIP, as modified on June 1, 2018, unvested units Champion Holdings granted under the MIP were exchanged for unregistered, time-vesting restricted shares and performance-vesting restricted shares of the Company subject to stock restriction agreements (the “SRAs”). The exchange was accounted for as a modification. The time-vesting restricted shares contained service conditions in which vesting would occur 20 % per year over a five-year period, unless certain performance conditions were achieved in which vesting would occur immediately upon a change of control or upon an occurrence of a follow-on public offering as defined in the SRAs. During fiscal 2019, a significant portion of the outstanding restricted shares vested in conjunction with certain follow-on public offerings. The incremental fair value of the modification of the awards was $ 95.1 million and was recognized in fiscal 2019 as all vesting conditions were met during the period. The value of the awards that vested during fiscal 2020 was $ 4.2 million. A summary of the activity associated with these awards is as follows: (Amounts in thousands) Management Incentive Plan Award Units Time Based Restricted Share Awards Performance Based Restricted Share Awards Outstanding at April 1, 2017 12,504 — — Granted 351 — — Forfeited ( 200 ) — — Outstanding at March 31, 2018 12,655 — — Granted 1,000 — — Forfeited — — — Exchange of MIP awards for restricted share awards ( 13,655 ) 290 3,686 Vested — — ( 3,686 ) Outstanding at March 30, 2019 — 290 — Granted — — — Forfeited — — — Vested — ( 145 ) — Outstanding at March 28, 2020 — 145 — On September 26, 2018, the Company’s shareholders approved the Company’s 2018 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Equity Plan”) which provides for grants of options, stock appreciation rights, restricted and unrestricted stock and stock units, performance awards, and other awards convertible into or otherwise based on shares of the Company’s common stock. Prior to the approval of the Equity Plan, the Company maintained the Skyline Corporation 2015 Stock Incentive Plan, which allowed for the grant of stock options and other equity awards. General terms and methods of valuation for the Company’s share-based awards granted under the Equity Plan are described below. F-25 Stock Options Stock options generally have terms of 10 years, with one-third of each grant vesting each year for three years , and are assigned an exercise price that is equal to or greater than closing market price of a share of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. When determining expected volatility, the Company considered volatility of guideline public companies. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant, based on the options’ expected term. The expected term of the options is based on the time period to exercise for each vesting tranche, which is calculated based on the average of: (i) the full option contractual term; and (ii) the starting vest date. A summary of the activity associated with these awards is as follows: Shares (in thousands) Weighted Average Exercise Price Per Share Weighted Average Remaining Term (in years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value (in thousands) Outstanding at March 31, 2018 — Granted 146 $ 15.00 Exercised — Outstanding at March 30, 2019 146 $ 15.00 Granted 266 $ 32.11 Exercised ( 8 ) $ 15.00 Forfeitures ( 1 ) $ 15.00 Outstanding at March 28, 2020 403 $ 26.29 9.4 $ 58 Vested and expected to vest at March 28, 2020 403 $ 26.29 9.4 $ 58 Exercisable at March 28, 2020 41 $ 15.00 8.8 $ 17 The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model along with the weighted average grant date fair value for awards granted in the periods presented are as follows: Option Award Assumptions Fiscal 2020 Fiscal 2019 Weighted-average assumptions used: Expected volatility 30.0 % 25.8 % Dividend yield — — Risk-free interest rate 1.7 % 2.4 % Expected term, in years 5.88 5.75 Weighted average grant date fair value per share $ 10.33 $ 3.93 F-26 Performance Share Units In fiscal 2020 and 2019, the Company issued performance share units that contain market vesting conditions and service conditions. The market condition is based on the Company’s total shareholder return (“TSR”) compared to the median TSR of certain companies over a three year performance period. The Company used a Monte-Carlo simulation to determine the grant date fair value for these awards, which takes into consideration the possible outcomes pertaining to the TSR market condition. In general, 0 % to 150 % of the Company’s performance share units vest on the third anniversary of the vesting commencement date based upon achievement of the market condition as specified in the performance share unit agreement. A summary of the activity associated with these awards is as follows: Shares (in thousands) Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Per Unit Outstanding at March 31, 2018 — Granted 146 $ 3.62 Vested — $ - Outstanding at March 30, 2019 146 $ 3.62 Granted 86 $ 29.05 Vested — $ - Forfeitures ( 2 ) $ 3.62 Outstanding at March 28, 2020 230 $ 13.85 The assumptions used in the Monte-Carlo simulation for performance share units along with the weighted-average grant date fair value for awards granted in the periods presented are as follows: Performance Unit Assumptions Fiscal 2020 Fiscal 2019 Weighted-average assumptions used: Expected volatility 30.0 % 29.5 % Dividend yield — — Risk-free interest rate 1.6 % 2.4 % Expected term, in years 2.84 2.49 Weighted average grant date fair value per share $ 29.05 $ 3.62 Restricted Stock Units and Restricted Share Awards Restricted stock units are valued at the market price of a share of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. In general, these awards have graded vesting conditions in which a portion of awards vest ratably in three equal installments on the anniversary of the vesting commencement date. The total fair value of restricted stock vesting was approximately $ 2.1 million during fiscal 2020 and $ 8.5 million during fiscal 2019. The weighted average grant date fair value for restricted stock units granted in fiscal 2020 was $ 31.34 and in fiscal 2019 was $ 14.24 . The weighted average grant date fair value for restricted share awards granted in fiscal 2019 was $ 29.77 .

Earnings Per Share Basic net income (loss) per share (“EPS”) attributable to the Company was computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to the Company by the average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The Company’s time-vesting and performance-vesting restricted share awards are considered participating securities. Diluted earnings per common share is computed based on the more dilutive of: (i) the two-class method, assuming the participating securities are not exercised or converted; or (ii) the summation of average common shares outstanding and additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential common shares had been issued. During fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018, the two-class method was more dilutive. The number of shares used to calculate earnings per share prior to the Exchange was determined based on the exchange ratio, as defined in the Exchange Agreement. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share: Year Ended (Dollars and shares in thousands, except per share data) March 28, 2020 March 30, 2019 March 31, 2018 Numerator: Net income (loss) $ 58,160 $ ( 58,208 ) $ 15,800 Undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities ( 170 ) — ( 996 ) Net income (loss) attributable to the Company's common shareholders $ 57,990 $ ( 58,208 ) $ 14,804 Denominator: Basic weighted average shares outstanding 56,516 53,491 44,491 Dilutive securities 246 — — Diluted weighted average shares outstanding 56,762 53,491 44,491 Basic net income (loss) per share: $ 1.03 $ ( 1.09 ) $ 0.33 Diluted net income (loss) per share: $ 1.02 $ ( 1.09 ) $ 0.33 Securities that could potentially dilute basic EPS in the future that were considered antidilutive in the periods presented are shown below: Type of security (in thousands) March 28, 2020 March 30, 2019 Options $ 53 $ 146 Restricted Share Units 60 158 Performance Share Units 133 146 Total dilutive securities $ 246 $ 450 15. Retirement Plans The Company’s U.S. subsidiary sponsors a defined contribution savings plan covering most U.S. employees. Full-time employees covered by the plan are eligible to participate. Participating employees may contribute from 1 % to 25 % of their compensation to the plan, with the Company matching 50 % of the first 6 % of pay contributed. The Company match vests after three years of employment or immediately for employees age 50 and over. The Company recognized expense of $ 2.4 million and $ 0.6 million related to this plan during fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company made no matching contributions to this plan in fiscal 2018. Full-time employees of the Company’s subsidiaries in Canada are generally covered by employer-sponsored defined contribution plans that require employee contributions and employer matching contributions. The Company recognized expense of $ 0.6 million in each of fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018. F-28 1 6 . Transactions with Related Parties Prior to the Exchange, the Company was party to a Management Advisory Services Agreement (“Services Agreement”) with Centerbridge Advisors, LLC (“Centerbridge”), MAK Management L.P.(“MAK”), and Sankaty Advisors, LLC (“Bain”), collectively, the “Managers”, affiliates of which collectively owned a majority of the units of the Company and the Company’s common stock (the “Principal Shareholders”), whereby the Principal Shareholders provided management, consulting, financial and other advisory services to the Company in exchange for an annual management fee totaling $ 1.5 million plus reimbursable expenses. Management fee expense during fiscal 2019, recognized prior to the Exchange, was $ 0.3 million. The Service Agreement was terminated in connection with the Exchange. Management fee expense was $ 1.5 million for fiscal 2018. Management fee expense is included in SG&A expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. On June 1, 2018, the Company, the Principal Shareholders, Champion Holdings, and certain other parties entered into a registration rights agreement providing for, among other things, customary demand registration rights, shelf registration rights and “piggyback” registration rights in favor of the Principal Shareholders and Arthur J. Decio. The Company registered shares for its own account and registered for sale shares held by the Principal Shareholders and others. As the result of a sale of shares by the Principal Shareholders on September 25, 2018, the Principal Shareholders held less than 50 % of the Company’s outstanding shares. Two of the Principal Shareholders, Bain and Centerbridge, have sold all of their shares in the Company. The Company did not sell any shares. MAK and Arthur J. Decio continue to hold registration rights in their favor, and their shares are registered for sale. On June 1, 2018 the Company, the Principal Shareholders and Champion Holdings entered into an investor rights agreement (the “Investor Rights Agreement”). The Investor Rights Agreement provides for, among other things, certain information rights and certain agreements relating to the composition of the Board of Directors. As the result of Bain and Centerbridge selling their holdings in the Company, they no longer meet the ownership thresholds to participate in the Investor Rights Agreement. Additionally, the Company and Champion Holdings entered into a transition services agreement, pursuant to which the Company provided certain services to Champion Holdings, including accounting and financial reporting services, tax services, cash and capital management services, and services relating to Champion Holdings’ members and liquidation. 1 7 . Segment Information Financial results for the Company's reportable segments have been prepared using a management approach, which is consistent with the basis and manner in which financial information is evaluated by the Company's chief operating decision maker in allocating resources and in assessing performance. The Company’s chief operating decision maker, the Chief Executive Officer, evaluates the performance of the Company’s segment primarily based on net sales, before elimination of inter-company shipments, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) and operating assets. The Company operates in two reportable segments: (i) U.S. Factory-built Housing, which includes manufacturing and retail housing operations and (ii) Canadian Factory-built Housing. Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation operations, corporate costs directly incurred for all segments and intersegment eliminations. Segments are generally determined by geography. Segment data includes intersegment revenues and corporate office costs that are directly and exclusively incurred for each segment. Total assets for Corporate/Other primarily include cash and certain deferred tax items not specifically allocated to another segment. F-29 Selected financial information by reportable segment was as follows: Year Ended (Dollars in thousands) March 28, 2020 March 30, 2019 March 31, 2018 Net sales: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 1,226,393 $ 1,177,687 $ 860,488 Canadian Factory-built Housing 84,196 98,567 96,603 Corporate/Other 59,141 83,789 107,631 Consolidated net sales $ 1,369,730 $ 1,360,043 $ 1,064,722 Operating income: U.S. Factory-built Housing EBITDA $ 131,339 $ 111,857 $ 66,747 Canadian Factory-built Housing EBITDA 9,272 10,417 10,800 Corporate/Other EBITDA ( 35,610 ) ( 135,937 ) ( 14,698 ) Depreciation ( 13,116 ) ( 11,259 ) ( 7,773 ) Amortization ( 5,430 ) ( 4,820 ) ( 487 ) Consolidated operating income (loss) $ 86,455 $ ( 29,742 ) $ 54,589 Depreciation: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 11,015 $ 9,507 $ 6,360 Canadian Factory-built Housing 1,073 933 907 Corporate/Other 1,028 819 506 Consolidated depreciation $ 13,116 $ 11,259 $ 7,773 Amortization of intangible assets: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 5,430 $ 4,587 $ 241 Canadian Factory-built Housing — 233 246 Corporate/Other — — — Consolidated amortization of intangible assets $ 5,430 $ 4,820 $ 487 Capital expenditures: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 11,753 $ 9,494 $ 7,348 Canadian Factory-built Housing 1,566 879 888 Corporate/Other 2,070 1,719 1,206 Consolidated capital expenditures $ 15,389 $ 12,092 $ 9,442 (Dollars in thousands) March 28, 2020 March 30, 2019 Total Assets: U.S. Factory-built Housing (1) $ 491,110 $ 488,878 Canadian Factory-built Housing (1) 56,760 59,260 Corporate/Other (1) 233,830 151,816 Consolidated total assets $ 781,700 $ 699,954 (1) Deferred tax assets for the Canadian operations are reflected in the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment. U.S. deferred tax assets are presented in Corporate/Other because an allocation between segments is not practicable. F-30 1 8 . Commitments, Contingencies, and Concentrations Repurchase Contingencies and Guarantees The Company is contingently liable under terms of repurchase agreements with lending institutions that provide wholesale floor plan financing to retailers. These arrangements, which are customary in the manufactured housing industry, provide for the repurchase of products sold to retailers in the event of default by the retailer on their agreement to pay the financial institution. The risk of loss from these agreements is significantly reduced by the potential resale value of any products that are subject to repurchase and is spread over numerous retailers. The repurchase price is generally determined by the original sales price of the product less contractually defined curtailment payments. Based on these repurchase agreements and our historical loss experience, we establish an associated loss reserve which was $ 1.0 million at March 28, 2020 and March 30, 2019. Excluding the resale value of the homes, the contingent repurchase obligation as of December 28, 2019 was estimated to be approximately $ 152.7 million. Losses incurred on homes repurchased were immaterial during each of the fiscal years ended March 28, 2020, March 30, 2019, and March 31, 2018. At March 28, 2020, the Company was contingently obligated for approximately $ 28.7 million under letters of credit, primarily consisting of $ 12.7 million to support long-term debt, $ 15.7 million to support the casualty insurance program, and $ 0.3 million to support bonding agreements. The letters of credit are issued under a sub-facility of the Credit Agreement. The Company was also contingently obligated for $ 23.7 million under surety bonds, generally to support performance on long-term construction contracts and license and service bonding requirements. In the normal course of business, the Company’s former subsidiaries that operated in the United Kingdom historically provided certain guarantees to two customers. Those guarantees provide contractual liability for proven construction defects up to 12 years from the date of delivery of certain products. The guarantees remain a contingent liability of the Company which declines over time through October 2027. As of the date of this report, the Company expects few, if any, claims to be reported under the terms of the guarantees. Legal Proceedings The Company has agreed to indemnify counterparties in the ordinary course of its business in agreements to acquire and sell business assets and in financing arrangements. The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of its business. As of the date of this filing, the Company believes the ultimate liability with respect to these contingent obligations will not have, either individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Concentrations The components and products used in the factory-built housing operations are presently available from a variety of vendors, and the Company is not dependent upon any single supplier. Prices of certain materials, such as lumber, insulation, steel and drywall, can fluctuate significantly due to changes in demand and supply. Additionally, availability of certain materials, such as drywall and insulation, has sometimes been limited, resulting in higher prices and/or the need to find alternative suppliers. The Company generally has been able to pass higher material costs on to its customers in the form of surcharges and price increases. For fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, sales from the Company’s Canadian operations were approximately 6 %, 7 %, and 9 %, respectively, of consolidated sales. T he Company’s net assets in Canada totaled approximately $ 45.0 million and $ 41.6 million at March 28, 2020 and March 30, 2019, respectively. The Company has approximately 6,600 employees. The Company’s manufacturing facilities in Canada employ approximately 700 workers, and most of the workers belong to trade associations that operate under collective bargaining agreements. There are five collective bargaining agreements (one for each Canadian plant) and each have separate expiration dates. One agreement expired in November 2019 and is still under renegotiation, two agreements are set to expire in June 2020 , one agreement is set to expire in November 2021 , and one agreement is set to expire in November 2022 .

B USINESS General On June 1, 2018, Skyline Champion Corporation (formerly known as Skyline Corporation), an Indiana corporation, and Champion Enterprises Holdings, LLC (“Champion Holdings”) combined their operations pursuant to the Share Contribution & Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”), dated as of January 5, 2018, by and between Skyline Corporation and Champion Holdings. Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, Champion Holdings contributed to Skyline Corporation all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Champion Holdings’ wholly owned operating subsidiaries, Champion Home Builders, Inc. (“CHB”), and CHB International B.V. (“CIBV”) (the shares of stock of CHB and CIBV contributed to Skyline Corporation, the “Contributed Shares”), and in exchange for the Contributed Shares, Skyline Corporation issued to the members of Champion Holdings, in the aggregate, 47,752,008 shares of Skyline Corporation common stock, $0.0277 par value per share (such issuance, the “Shares Issuance”). The contribution of the Contributed Shares by Champion Holdings to the Corporation, and the Shares Issuance by Skyline Corporation to the members of Champion Holdings are collectively referred to herein as the “Exchange.” The Exchange was treated as a purchase of the Company by Champion Holdings for accounting and financial reporting purposes. As a result, the financial results for all periods presented prior to the Exchange are comprised solely of the results of Champion Holdings. We are the largest independent publicly traded factory-built housing company in North America with pro forma net sales in fiscal year 2019 of $1.4 billion. We have more than 65 years of homebuilding experience, approximately 7,000 employees and 36 manufacturing facilities located in 17 states across the United States and three provinces in western Canada at March 30, 2019. We offer a leading portfolio of manufactured and modular homes, park model RVs and modular buildings for the multi-family, hospitality, senior and workforce housing sectors. Our facilities are strategically located to serve strong markets in the United States and western Canada. We operate 12 manufacturing facilities in the top 10 states for total number of manufactured home shipments in 2018 as well as 15 manufacturing facilities in the top 10 fastest growing states for manufactured home shipments over the last ten years. We believe that we maintain the following leading positions in the factory-built housing industry in the United States and western Canada based on units produced in 2018: • Number two position in the manufactured housing market segment in the United States • Top three position in most major U.S. regional markets • A leading position in western Canada • A leading position in park model RV sales and modular home sales We believe our leading positions are driven by our comprehensive product offering, strong brand reputation, broad manufacturing footprint, and our complementary retail and logistics businesses. Our market segment share in the United States manufactured housing market segment has increased from 8% in the beginning of fiscal 2011 to 17% in fiscal 2019 based on total number of units produced. We design and build a range of manufactured and modular homes, park model RVs, and commercial structures. We believe that the high quality and broad scope of our product and service offerings provide us a competitive advantage relative to other factory-built and certain site-built homes. With our strong and award winning product designs, we seek to meet the needs of our localized customers, while also providing them with customizable options. Our leading brands are marketed and distributed through a network of independent and company-owned retailers, community operators, government agencies, and commercial developers . We build homes under some of the most well known brand names in the factory-built housing industry including Skyline Homes, Champion Home Builders, Athens Park Models, Dutch Housing, Excel Homes, Homes of Merit, New Era, Redman Homes, Shore Park, Silvercrest, and Titan Homes in the U.S., and Moduline and SRI Homes in western Canada. In addition to our core home building business, we operate a factory-direct retail business, Titan Factory Direct, with 21 sale centers spanning the southern United States, and Star Fleet Trucking, which provides transportation services to the manufactured housing and other industries from several dispatch locations across the United States. We have a proven ability to distribute orders efficiently across our manufacturing footprint based on market demand, workforce availability, and our surrounding distribution capabilities. We are standardizing our manufacturing processes and employing metrics-driven accountability measures across all of our facilities. We also believe we have a scalable plant network including five idle manufacturing plants to support future growth in the factory-built housing market segment. 3 Table of Contents We intend to capitalize on favorable demand drivers and demographic trends, underutilized capacity within our manufacturing plant footprint, a pipeline of operational initiatives, product expansion, and plant and retail sales center acquisition opportunities to support our future growth initiatives. The manufactured housing industry, which currently represents abo ut 10% of total home starts, is expected to grow faster than the broader single-family housing market segment, and we believe we are well positioned to benefit from that industry dynamic. We believe our idle manufacturing plants provide us with the ability to grow with increasing demand. We also believe that our national scale and competitive advantages enable us to capture market segment share from competitors and make selective value enhancing acquisitions. We have a proven track-record of executing and i ntegrating acquisitions and plant openings having successfully completed three acquisitions and three openings of idle facilities over the last five years. The terms "" Skyline Champion,"" ""us,"" ""we,"" ""our,"" the ""Company,"" and any other similar terms refer to Skyline Champion Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated in this Annual Report. Corporate Information Skyline Champion Corporation was originally incorporated in Indiana in 1959 as Skyline Corporation. Following the completion of the Exchange, we changed our name to Skyline Champion Corporation. Our principal executive offices are located at 2520 By-Pass Road, Elkhart, Indiana 46515. Our website is located at www. skylinechampion .com. Our website and the information contained on our website is not incorporated by reference and is not a part of this Annual Report. Business Strategies We intend to continue to pursue opportunities to profitably grow our revenue at a rate in excess of the broader single-family housing market segment in the United States, as well as improve our operating margins by executing on the following strategic initiatives. Capitalize on Favorable Manufactured Housing Demand Drivers There have been a number of recent favorable demographic trends and demand drivers in the United States, including underlying growth trends in key homebuyer groups, such as the population over 65 years of age, the population of first-time home buyers and the population of households earning less than $50,000 per year. We intend to capitalize on these trends and drivers to grow our business. We believe that there is an opportunity for continued manufactured and modular construction market segment expansion driven by the foregoing trends and demand drivers, as well as construction labor shortages in certain regions (which tend to adversely and disproportionally impact supply and cost of site-built homes when compared to manufactured housing) and increased affordability of factory-built homes relative to site-built homes. We will seek to capture additional demand from manufactured housing communities that increase spending on expansion and development projects. In addition, if financing availability continues to improve and related regulation continues to ease, we believe that there will be an increase in the number of prospective customers who qualify for home loans for manufactured and modular homes. Finally, as one of only a limited number of manufactured homebuilders who have been approved for contracts with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (“ FEMA”), and have historically provided housing assistance requirements following natural disasters and other housing emergencies. Expand Sales in Existing, Adjacent and New Geographies and Segments We design, produce, market, and transport a range of manufactured and modular homes, park model RVs, and commercial solutions. We believe the broad scope of our product and service offerings provide us advantages relative to other factory-built housing companies. We have a track record of sales growth and have demonstrated our ability to broaden our manufacturing and retail presence through the successful execution of a balanced organic growth and acquisition-based strategy. We are focused on meeting increasing demand by using additional capacity within our existing operating footprint, opening idle manufacturing facilities, and by expanding existing plants in selected geographies. We have continued to grow our distribution through community relationships, park model sales, commercial and modular solutions and expanded retail operations. We have also continued to develop relationships with manufactured housing finance providers to further accelerate our revenue growth opportunities. We intend to continue to expand our commercial platform. For example, in the hospitality sector we have increased our commercial construction visibility working with a leading global hospitality brand. We also intend to explore opportunities to acquire additional retail locations, manufacturing facilities, and factory-built housing competitors to supplement our organic growth initiatives. 4 Table of Contents Continue to Implement Operational Initiatives to Further Enhance Margins We have been able to expand our operating margins over time as a result of increased volume, reduction of our material cost structure, and company-wide efforts focused on standardization and simplification of our operations. We are currently focused on a number of ongoing operational initiatives to further enhance our operating margins, including: • executing on integration synergies related to identified procurement, operational and labor cost saving opportunities as well as streamlining overlapping functions; • continuing to refine product offerings through product standardization; • enhancing product value to the customer through material substitution and improved design; and • focusing on operational excellence and production efficiency through further simplification of our manufacturing process. Among other initiatives, we plan to further develop our modular platform, expand our commercial product lines, standardize our engineering and design platform, and better leverage our fixed costs from underutilized plants by routing additional demand to plants with excess capacity. Expand and Maintain Quality Products through Innovation and Development We plan to continue to innovate our home designs and home products to meet the needs of existing and new customers. We have received a number of awards from the Manufactured Housing Institute, the National Association of Home Builders, and others for our leadership in manufactured and modular home designs, craftsmanship and quality. We maintain an active dialogue with residential and commercial developers to identify demand trends and anticipate the needs of prospective homeowners. We also plan to continue to work closely with our suppliers to pilot new products and amenities, such as in-home smart technologies and luxury interior finishes. Factory-Built Housing A majority of our manufactured products are constructed in accordance with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) National Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards (""HUD code""). We produce a broad range of manufactured and modular homes under a variety of brand names and in a variety of floor plans and price ranges. While most of the homes we build are single-family, multi-section, ranch-style homes, we also build two-story, single-section, and Cape Cod style homes as well as multi-family units such as town homes, apartments, duplexes, and triplexes. The single-family homes that we manufacture generally range in size from 400 to 4,000 square feet and typically include two to four bedrooms, a living room or family room, a dining room, a kitchen and typically two full bathrooms. We also build park model RVs for resorts and campgrounds and commercial modular structures, including hotels, and student and workforce housing. We regularly introduce homes with new floor plans, exterior designs and elevations, decors and features. Our corporate marketing and engineering departments work with our manufacturing facilities to design homes that appeal to consumers’ changing tastes at appropriate price points for their respective markets. We design and build homes with a traditional residential or site-built appearance through the use of, among other features, dormers and higher pitched roofs. We also design and build energy efficient homes, and several of our U.S. manufacturing facilities are qualified to produce “Energy Star®” rated homes. We have received a number of awards from the Manufactured Housing Institute (“MHI”), the National Association of Home Builders, and others for our leadership in manufactured and modular home designs, craftsmanship and quality. Most recently we were awarded the Excellence in Home Design for Modular Homes and Single Section HUD Home by the National Association for Home Builders Award and Best New Home Design Award for Modular Homes Less than 2,000 Square Feet and Modular Home over 4,000 Square Feet by MHI. The components and products used in factory-built housing are generally of the same quality as those used by other home builders, including conventional site-builders. The primary components include lumber, plywood, OSB, drywall, steel, floor coverings, insulation, exterior siding (vinyl, composites, wood and metal), doors, windows, shingles, kitchen appliances, furnaces, plumbing and electrical fixtures and hardware. These components are presently available from a variety of sources and we are not dependent upon any single supplier. Prices of certain materials such as lumber, insulation, steel and drywall can fluctuate significantly due to changes in demand and supply. Additionally, availability of certain materials such as drywall and insulation have sometimes been limited, resulting in higher prices and/or the need to find alternative suppliers. We generally have been able to pass higher material costs on to customers in the form of surcharges and price increases. 5 Table of Contents Most completed factory-built homes have ca binets, wall coverings and electrical, heating and plumbing systems. HUD-code homes also generally contain factory installed floor coverings, appliances and window treatments. Optional factory installed features include fireplaces, dormers, entertainment c enters and skylights. Upon completion of the home at the factory, homes sold to retailers are transported to a retail sales center or directly to the home site. Homes sold to builders and developers are generally transported directly to the home site. Afte r the retail sale of a stock home to the consumer, the home is transported to the home site. At the home site, the home is placed on a foundation or otherwise affixed to the property and readied for occupancy typically by setup contractors. The sections of a multi-section home are joined and the interior and exterior seams are finished at the home site. The consumer purchase of the home may also include retailer or contractor supplied items such as additional appliances, air conditioning, furniture, porches , decks and garages. We construct homes in indoor facilities using an assembly-line process employing approximately 100 to 200 production employees at each facility. Factory-built homes are constructed in one or more sections (also known as floors) on an affixed steel support frame that allows the sections to be moved through the assembly line and transported upon sale. The sections of many of the modular homes we produce are built on wooden floor systems and transported on carriers that are removed upon placement of the home at the home site. Each section or floor is assembled in stages, beginning with the construction of the frame and the floor, then adding the walls, ceiling and roof assembly, and other constructed and purchased components, and ending with a final quality control inspection. The efficiency of the assembly-line process, protection from the weather, and favorable pricing of materials resulting from our substantial purchasing power enables us to produce homes more quickly and often at a lower cost than a conventional site-built home of similar quality. The production schedules of our homebuilding facilities are based upon customer orders, which can fluctuate from week to week. Orders from retailers are generally subject to cancellation at any time without penalty and are not necessarily an indication of future business. Retailers place orders for retail stocking (inventory) purposes and for homebuyer orders. Before scheduling homes for production, orders and availability of financing are confirmed with our customer and, where applicable, their lender. Orders are generally filled within 90 days of receipt, depending upon the level of unfilled orders and requested delivery dates. Because we produce homes to fill existing wholesale orders, our factories generally do not carry finished goods inventories, except for homes awaiting delivery. Although factory-built homes can be produced throughout the year in indoor facilities, demand for homes is usually affected by inclement weather and by the cold winter months in northern areas of the U.S. and in Canada. Typically, a one to three-week supply of raw materials is maintained. Charges to transport homes increase with the distance from the factory to the retailer or home site. As a result, most of the retailers and builders/developers we sell to are located within a 500-mile radius of our manufacturing plants. At March 30, 2019, we had a backlog of home orders with wholesale sales values of approximately $142.7 million. After production of a particular home has commenced, the order becomes noncancelable and the retailer is obligated to take delivery of the home. In response to accelerating demand, we have raised production levels by increasing our workforce size and capabilities. However, the constrained labor market is a key challenge to further increasing production to keep pace with increased order rates. In addition, we have implemented higher product pricing to offset rising input costs, including labor and material price increases. We offer a wide selection of manufactured and modular homes as well as park model RVs at company-owned retail locations across Texas and the Southeast U.S. marketed under the Titan Factory Direct brand. We maintain company-owned retail presence through 21 retail sales centers in Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Texas, and Virginia. We have benefited from the strategic expansion of our captive distribution to enhance the reach of our factory-built housing products directly to the homebuyer. Each of our full-service retail sales centers has a sales office and a variety of display model homes of various sizes, floor plans, features, and prices that are displayed in a residential setting with sidewalks and landscaping. Customers may purchase a home from an inventory of homes maintained at the location, including a model home, or may order a home that will be built at a manufacturing facility. The collective benefits of our retail organization provide industry leadership with the expertise to be proactive to local economic conditions and ultimately provide affordable homes to value-conscious homebuyers. During fiscal 2019, the average selling price for our factory-built homes was $60,600. Manufactured home sales prices ranged from $30,000 to over $200,000. Retail sales prices of the homes, without land, generally ranged from $35,000 to over $250,000, depending upon size, floor plan, features and options. 6 Table of Contents Logistics We operate a logistics business, Star Fleet, specializing in the transportation of manufactured homes and recreational vehicles from manufacturing facilities to retailers. Star Fleet’s delivery logistics are coordinated through dispatch terminals located in Idaho, Indiana, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, and Texas. Star Fleet has strong relationships with its customer base, which consists of some of the largest manufactured housing companies (including our own factory-built housing products), recreational vehicle manufacturers and related product manufacturers in the U.S. Financing Commercial Financing. Independent retailers of factory-built homes generally finance their inventory purchases from manufacturers with floor plan financing provided by third party lending institutions and secured by a lien on the homes. The availability and cost of floor plan financing can affect the amount of retailer new home inventory, the number of retail sales centers and related wholesale demand. Under a typical floor plan financing arrangement, an independent financial institution specializing in this line of business provides the retailer with a loan for the purchase price of the home and maintains a security interest in the home as collateral. The financial institution customarily requires us, as the manufacturer of the home, to enter into a separate repurchase agreement with the financial institution that, upon default by the retailer and under certain other circumstances, obligates us to repurchase the financed home at declining prices over the term of the repurchase agreement (which, in most cases, is 18 to 36 months). The price at which we may be obligated to repurchase a home under these agreements is based upon the amount financed, plus certain administrative and shipping expenses. Our obligation under these repurchase agreements ceases upon the purchase of the home by the retail customer. The maximum amount of our contingent obligations under such repurchase agreements was approximately $173.4 million as of March 30, 2019. The risk of loss under these agreements is spread over many retailers and is further reduced by the resale value of the homes. During fiscal 2019, approximately 35% of our sales to independent retailers were financed by retailers under floor plan agreements with national lenders, while the remaining 65% were financed under various arrangements with local or regional banks or paid in cash. We generally receive payment from the lending institution 5 to 10 days after a home is sold and invoiced to an independent retailer. Consumer Financing. Sales of factory-built homes are significantly affected by the availability, credit underwriting standards, and cost of consumer financing. There are three basic types of consumer financing in the factory-built housing industry: conforming mortgage loans which comply with the requirements of Federal Housing Administration (“FHA”), Department of Veterans Affairs (“VA”), Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) or Government-Sponsored Enterprise (“GSE”) loans; non-conforming mortgages for purchasers of the home and the land on which the home is placed; and personal property loans (often referred to as home-only or chattel loans) for consumers where the home is the sole collateral for the loan (generally HUD code homes). Industry trade associations are working towards favorable legislative and GSE action to address the mortgage financing needs of potential buyers of affordable homes. Federal law requires the GSEs to issue a regulation to implement the ""Duty to Serve"" requirements specified in the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992, as amended by the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008. FNMA and FHLMC released their final Underserved Markets Plan that describes, with specificity, the actions they will take over a three-year period to fulfill the ""Duty to Serve"" obligation. These plans became effective on January 1, 2018. Each of the three-year plans is intended to establish steps to ensure home-only loans can be purchased in bulk prior to proceeding with a pilot program to purchase these loans. Expansion of the secondary market for home-only lending through the GSEs could provide further demand for housing, as lending options would likely become more available to home buyers. Although some limited progress has been made in this area, meaningful positive impact in the form of increased home orders has yet to be realized. In the second half of 2018, the GSEs also rolled out real property programs targeting to acquire over 12,000 land home purchase mortgages in 2019. Market Overview General. Factory-built housing provides an alternative to other forms of new low-cost housing such as site-built housing and condominiums, and to existing housing such as pre-owned homes and apartments. According to statistics published by the Institute for Building Technology and Safety (""IBTS"") and the United States Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, for the 2018 calendar year, manufactured housing wholesale shipments of homes constructed in accordance with the HUD code accounted for an estimated 10.5% of all new single-family homes starts. 7 Table of Contents According to data reported by the Manufactured Housing Institute (""MHI""), industry home shipments continue to improve, increasing to approximately 93,377 HUD code (or 93,265 excluding FEMA ) units shipped during fisca l year 201 9 , compared to the 95,044 (or 90,629 excluding FEMA ) units shipped during fiscal year 201 8 and 8 5,550 (or 81,346 excluding FEMA ) units ship ped in fiscal year 201 7 . Annual shipments have increased each year since calendar year 2009 when only 50,000 HUD code manufactured homes were shipped, the lowest level since the industry began recording statistics in 1959. While shipments of HUD code manufactured homes have improved modestly in recent years, the manufactured housing industry continues to o perate at relatively low levels compared to historical shipment statistics. The market for factory-built housing is affected by a number of factors, including the availability, cost and credit underwriting standards of consumer financing, consumer confidence, employment levels, general housing market, interest rates and other economic conditions and the overall affordability of factory-built housing versus other forms of housing. In the past, a number of factors have restricted demand for factory-built housing, including, in some cases, less-favorable financing terms compared to site-built housing, the effects of restrictive zoning on the availability of certain locations for home placement and, in some cases, an unfavorable public image. Certain of these adverse factors have lessened considerably in recent years with the improved quality and appearance of factory-built housing. Home Buyer Demographics. We believe the segment of the housing market in which manufactured housing is most competitive includes consumers with household incomes under $60,000. This segment has a high representation of young single persons and married couples, first time home buyers and elderly or retired persons. The comparatively low cost of manufactured homes attracts these consumers. People in rural areas, where fewer housing alternatives exist, and those who presently live in factory-built homes, also make up a significant portion of the demand for new factory-built housing. We believe higher-priced, multi-section manufactured and modular homes are attractive to households with higher incomes as an alternative to rental housing and condominiums, and are well suited to meet the needs of the retiree buyer in many markets. The two largest manufactured housing consumer demographics, Millennials (generally defined as those born between 1981 – 1996) and Baby Boomers (generally defined as those born between 1946 – 1964), comprise the fastest growing populations. Millennials are generally first-time home buyers who may be attracted by the affordability, and diversity of style choices of factory-built homes. Baby Boomers are similarly interested in the value proposition; however, they are also motivated by the energy efficiency and low maintenance requirements of factory-built homes, and by the lifestyle offered by planned communities that are specifically designed for homeowners that fall into this age group. Competition The factory-built housing industry is highly competitive at both the manufacturing and retail levels, with competition based upon several factors, including price, product features, reputation for service and quality, depth of distribution, and retail customer financing. Capital requirements for entry into the industry are relatively low. According to MHI, in 2018, there were 35 producers of manufactured homes in the U.S. operating an estimated 133 production facilities. For calendar year 2018, the top 3 companies had a combined market share of HUD-code homes of approximately 77%, according to data published by Statistical Surveys, Inc. We estimate that there were approximately 4,000 industry retail locations throughout the U.S. during calendar year 2018. Based on industry data reported by IBTS, in calendar year 2018 our U.S. wholesale market share of HUD-code homes sold was 16.3%, compared to 13.9% in calendar year 2017. We compete with approximately 34 other producers of manufactured homes, as well as companies offering for sale homes repossessed from wholesalers or consumers. In addition, manufactured homes compete with new and existing site-built homes, as well as apartments, townhouses and condominiums. There are a number of other national manufacturers competing for a significant share of the manufactured housing market in the U.S., including Clayton Homes, Inc. and Cavco Industries. Certain of these competitors may possess greater financial, manufacturing, distribution and marketing resources. 8 Table of Contents Government Regulation Our manufactured homes are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws, codes and regulations. The majority of our homes are built to comply with the National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974, as amended, and the rules enacted thereunder. Collectively known as the “HUD Code”, these regulations cover all aspects of manufactured home construction and installation, including structural integrity, fire safety, wind loads, thermal protection and ventilation. To the extent state and local regulations conflict with the HUD Code they are pre-empted. Our modular homes and commercial structures are built to comply with applicable state and local building codes. Our park model RV’s are built in conformance with the applicable ANSI standards. A variety of laws affect the financing of the homes we manufacture. The Federal Consumer Credit Protection Act (""Truth-in-Lending Act"") and Regulation Z promulgated thereunder require written disclosure of information relating to such financing, including the amount of the annual percentage interest rate and the finance charge. A variety of state laws also regulate the form of financing documents and the allowable deposits, finance charge and fees chargeable pursuant to financing documents. In 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (""Dodd-Frank Act"") was passed into law. The Dodd-Frank Act was a sweeping piece of legislation designed to reform credit and lending practices after the global credit crisis of 2008. Although many rules have been implemented, the full impact will not be known for years as rule revisions and the enforcement of the rules continue to evolve. On May 24, 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (""Dodd-Frank Reform Act"") was signed into law. The Dodd-Frank Reform Act revises portions of the Dodd-Frank Act, reduces the regulatory burden on smaller financial institutions, including eliminating provisions of the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 (""SAFE Act""), and protects consumer access to credit. With the elimination of certain provisions of the SAFE Act, manufactured housing retailers can now assist home buyers with securing financing for the purchase of homes; however, they may not assist in negotiating the financing terms. This may enable buyers to more easily find access to financing. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 requires the GSEs to facilitate a secondary market for mortgages on housing for very low, low and moderate-income families in under-served markets, including manufactured housing. On January 30, 2017, the Federal Housing Finance Agency issued a final rule specifying the scope of GSE activities that are eligible to receive credit for compliance with the ""Duty to Serve"" rule after January 2018. On December 18, 2017, Both GSEs published their final Underserved Markets Plans for activities for the years beginning January 1, 2018, and continuing through 2020. Both GSEs have introduced initiatives to facilitate increased purchases of real property mortgages with manufactured homes under their existing single-family programs. In addition, both GSEs have announced plans for small-scale pilot programs for home-only (chattel) loans secured by manufactured housing. Governmental authorities enforcing these numerous laws and regulations can impose fines and/or seek injunctive relief for violations. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with the requirements of these applicable laws and regulations. Seasonality The housing industry is subject to seasonal fluctuations based on home buyer purchasing patterns. We typically experience decreased home buyer traffic during holidays and popular vacation periods. Demand for our core single-family new home products typically peaks each spring and summer before declining in the winter, consistent with the overall housing industry, although this pattern was partially interrupted during the winter of fiscal years 2018 and 2017, when we produced a limited number of disaster-relief homes for the FEMA. The U.S. has experienced extreme weather events over the past few years resulting in widespread property damage. It has been widely reported that the overall economic toll in the affected market areas that have experienced severe weather events is substantial. There has been somewhat increased consumer demand for replacement of homes lost as a result of these events. This may include demand for additional disaster-relief manufactured home orders from federal and state agencies. The Company has initially participated by producing a limited number of disaster-relief homes for FEMA. These homes were built in factories located in unaffected regions of the country, primarily during the winter months, which lessened disruptions to existing order demand from our core customer base. 9 Table of Contents Employees We have approximately 7,000 employees. We deem our relationship with our employees to be generally good. Currently, our manufacturing facilities in Canada employ approximately 850 workers, of which 700 are subject to five separate collective bargaining agreements. Two agreements, covering 400 employees, expire in November 2019 and June 2020. Available Information Our website address is www.skylinechampion.com and we make available, free of charge, on or through our website all of our periodic reports, including our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K, as soon as reasonably practicable after we file such reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Our business involves a number of risks and uncertainties. You should carefully consider the following risks, together with the information provided elsewhere in this Annual Report. The items described below are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks that are currently unknown to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial may also impair our business or adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. The factory-built housing industry is cyclical, is affected by seasonality and is sensitive to changes in general economic or other business conditions. The factory-built housing industry is affected by seasonality. Sales during the period from March to November are typically higher than in other months. As a result, the Company’s sales and operating results sometimes fluctuate and may continue to fluctuate in the future. The factory-built housing industry is also sensitive to changes in economic conditions and other factors, such as employment rates, job growth, population growth, consumer confidence, consumer income, availability of financing, interest rate levels and an oversupply of homes for sale. Changes in any of these conditions generally, or in the markets where the Company operates, could reduce demand and constrain pricing for new factory-built homes in these areas or result in customer cancellations of pending shipments. Reductions in the number of homes shipped by the Company or constraints on the prices it can charge, could result in a decrease in the Company’s net sales and earnings, which could adversely affect the Company’s financial condition. The Company is subject to demand fluctuations in the housing industry. Reductions in demand could adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations, and financial condition. Demand for the Company’s homes is subject to fluctuations in the housing market generally. In a housing market downturn, the Company’s sales and results of operations could be adversely affected; it may have significant inventory impairments and other write-offs; its gross margins may decline significantly from historical levels; and it may incur losses from operations. The Company cannot predict the continuation of the current housing recovery, nor can it provide assurance that should the recovery not continue its response will be successful. Future increases in interest rates, more stringent credit standards, tightening of financing terms, or other increases in the effective costs of owning a factory-built home (including those related to regulation or other government actions) could limit the purchasing power of the Company’s potential customers and could adversely affect the Company’s business and financial results. A large majority of the Company’s customers finance their home purchases through third-party lenders. While interest rates have increased moderately, they have been near historical lows for several years, which has made purchasing new factory-built homes more affordable. Increases in interest rates or decreases in the availability of consumer financing could adversely affect the market for homes. Potential customers may be less willing or able to pay the increased monthly costs or to obtain financing. Lenders may increase the qualifications needed for financing or adjust their terms to address any increased credit risk. These factors could adversely affect the sales or pricing of the Company’s factory-built homes. These developments have historically had, and may once again have, an adverse effect on the overall demand for factory-built housing and its competitiveness with other forms of housing, and could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition. The liquidity provided by GSEs and the FHA is also critical in insuring or purchasing home mortgages and creating or insuring investment securities that are either sold to investors or held in their portfolios. The impact of the federal government’s conservatorship of GSEs on the short-term and long-term demand for new housing as well as any potential restructuring of the GSEs remains unclear. Any limitations or restrictions on the availability of financing by these agencies could adversely affect interest rates, financing, and the Company’s sales of new homes. 10 Table of Contents The Dodd-Frank Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) to regulate consumer financial products and services. Since 2014, the CFPB has promulgated rules concerning consumer credit transactions secured by a dwelling, which include real property mortgages and chattel loans (financed without land) secured by factory-built homes. The rules have caused some lenders to curtail underwriting such loans, and some investors are reluctant to own or participate in owning such loans because of the uncertainty of potential litigation and other costs. Consequently, su ch regulatory developments could cause some prospective buyers of factory-built homes to be unable to secure the financing necessary to complete purchases. In addition, compliance with the law and ongoing rule implementation has caused lenders to incur add itional costs to implement new processes, procedures, controls, and infrastructure required to comply with the regulations. Compliance may constrain lenders’ ability to profitably price certain loans. Failure to comply with these regulations, changes in th ese or other regulations, or the imposition of additional regulations, could affect the Company’s earnings, limit its access to capital, and have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations. The CFPB rules amending the Truth in Lending Act and Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act expand the types of mortgage loans that are subject to the protections of the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act (“HOEPA”), revise and expand the tests for coverage under HOEPA, and impose additional restrictions on mortgages that are covered by HOEPA. As a result, certain factory-built home loans are now subject to HOEPA limits on interest rates and fees. Loans with rates or fees in excess of the limits are deemed “high cost mortgages” and provide additional protections for borrowers, including with respect to determining the value of the home. Most loans for the purchase of factory-built homes have been written at rates and fees that would not appear to be considered high cost mortgages under the rule. Although some lenders may continue to offer loans that are now deemed high cost mortgages, the rate and fee limits appear to have deterred some lenders from offering loans to certain borrowers and may continue to make them reluctant to enter into loans subject to the provisions of HOEPA. As a result, some prospective buyers of factory-built homes may be unable to secure financing necessary to complete factory-built home purchases. The availability of wholesale financing for retailers is limited due to a limited number of floor plan lenders and reduced lending limits. Factory-built housing retailers generally finance their inventory purchases with wholesale floor plan financing provided by lending institutions. The availability of wholesale financing is significantly affected by the number of floor plan lenders and their lending limits. Limited availability of floor plan lending negatively affects the inventory levels of the Company’s independent retailers, the number of retail sales center locations and related wholesale demand, and adversely affects the availability of and access to capital on an ongoing basis. As a result, if the availability of wholesale financing is reduced, the Company could experience sales declines or a higher level of customer defaults and its operating results and cash flows could suffer. The Company has contingent repurchase obligations related to wholesale financing provided to industry retailers. As is customary in the factory-built housing industry, a significant portion of the Company’s manufacturing sales to independent retailers are financed under floor plan agreements with financing companies. In connection with the floor plan financing programs, the Company generally has separate agreements with the financing companies that require the Company to repurchase homes upon default by the retailer and repossession of the homes by the financing companies. These repurchase agreements are applicable for various periods of time, generally up to 24 months after the sale of the home to the retailer. However, certain homes are subject to repurchase until the home is sold by the retailer. The Company’s contingent repurchase obligation as of March 30, 2019, was estimated to be approximately $173.4 million, without reduction for the resale value of the homes. The Company may be required to honor contingent repurchase obligations in the future and may incur additional expense and reduced cash flows because of these repurchase agreements. If the Company is unable to establish or maintain relationships with independent distributors who sell its homes, the Company’s sales could decline and its operating results and cash flows could suffer. Although the Company maintains its own factory direct retail business in select markets, it conducts a majority of its business through independent distributors. For example, over 90% of the Company’s shipments of homes in fiscal 2019 were made to independent distributors throughout the United States and western Canada. The Company may not be able to establish relationships with new independent distributors or maintain good relationships with independent distributors that sell its homes. Even if the Company does establish and maintain relationships with independent distributors, these customers are not obligated to sell the Company’s homes exclusively and may choose to sell competitors’ homes instead. The independent distributors with whom the Company has relationships can cancel these relationships on short notice. In addition, these customers may not remain financially solvent, as they are subject to similar industry, economic, demographic and seasonal trends that the Company faces. If the Company does not establish and maintain relationships with solvent independent distributors in the markets it serves, sales in those markets could decline, and if the Company cannot effect offsetting expansion of its factory-direct retail business, the Company’s operating results and cash flows could suffer. 11 Table of Contents Prices of certain material s can fluctuate and availability of certain materials may be limited at times. Prices of certain materials used in the construction of homes, such as lumber, insulation, steel, drywall, oil-based products and fuel, can fluctuate significantly due to changes in demand and supply. Additionally, availability of certain materials such as drywall and insulation may be limited at times, resulting in higher prices or the need to find alternative suppliers. The Company may attempt to pass the higher material costs on to customers, but it is not certain that it will be able to achieve this without affecting demand. Limited availability of materials may also adversely affect the Company’s production capabilities and results of operations. For some of the components used in production, the Company depends on a small group of suppliers and the loss of any of these suppliers could affect the Company’s ability to obtain components in a timely manner or at competitive prices, which would decrease its sales and profit margins. Some components are sourced from foreign sources and delays in obtaining these components or the imposition of new or additional tariffs could result in increased costs and decreased sales and profit margins. The Company depends on timely and sufficient delivery of components from its suppliers. Most components are readily available from a variety of sources. However, a few key components are currently produced by only a small group of quality suppliers that have the capacity to supply large quantities. Some of these components are foreign sourced and their supply is subject to disruption from government actions. If the Company cannot obtain an adequate supply of these key components its sales could decline and its operating results and cash flows could suffer. The Company’s results of operations can be adversely affected by labor shortages and turnover. The homebuilding industry has from time to time experienced labor shortages and other labor-related issues. A number of factors may adversely affect the labor force available to the Company and its subcontractors in one or more of its markets, including high employment levels, construction market conditions, and government regulation, which include laws and regulations related to workers’ health and safety, wage and hour practices, and immigration. The Company’s direct labor has historically experienced high turnover rates, which can lead to increased spending on training and retention and, as a result, increased costs of production. An overall labor shortage or a lack of skilled labor could cause significant increases in costs or delays in construction of homes, which could have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s net sales and results of operations. Industry conditions and future operating results could limit the Company’s sources of capital. If the Company is unable to locate suitable sources of capital when needed, it may be unable to maintain or expand its business. The Company depends on its cash balances, cash flows from operations, and its revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) to finance its operating requirements, capital expenditures, and other needs. If the Company’s cash balances, cash flows from operations, and availability under the Credit Facility are insufficient to finance its operations and alternative capital is not available, the Company may not be able to expand its business and make acquisitions, or it may need to curtail or limit its existing operations. Factory-built housing operates in the highly competitive housing industry, and, if other home builders are more successful or offer better value to the Company’s customers, the Company’s business could decline. The Company operates in a very competitive environment and faces competition from a number of other home builders in each market in which it operates. The Company competes with large national and regional home building companies and with smaller local home builders for financing, raw materials, and skilled management and labor resources. Some of the Company’s manufacturing competitors have captive retail distribution systems and consumer finance and insurance operations. In addition, there are independent factory-built housing retail locations that sell competitors’ products in most areas where the Company’s homes are sold and in most areas where it has retail operations. Because barriers to entry to the industry at both the manufacturing and retail levels are low, the Company believes that it is relatively easy for new competitors to enter its markets. In addition, the Company’s products compete within the housing industry more broadly with other forms of low to moderate-cost housing, including site-built homes, panelized homes, apartments, townhouses, condominiums, and repossessed homes. The Company also competes with resale homes, also referred to as “previously owned” or “existing” homes, as well as rental housing. An oversupply of homes available for sale or the heavy discounting of home prices by the Company’s competitors could adversely affect demand for the Company’s homes and the results of its operations. An increase in competitive conditions could have any of the following impacts on the Company: delivering fewer homes; sale of fewer homes or higher cancellations by the Company’s home buyers; an increase in selling incentives or reduction of prices; and realization of lower gross margins due to lower selling prices or an inability to increase selling prices to offset increased costs of the homes delivered. If the Company is unable to compete effectively in its markets, its business could decline disproportionately to that of its competitors. As a result, its sales could decline and its operating results and cash flows could suffer. 12 Table of Contents Changes in consumer preferences for the Company’s products or its failure to gauge those preferences could lead to reduced sales. The Company cannot be certain that historical consumer preferences for factory-built homes in general, and for its products in particular, will remain unchanged. The Company’s ability to remain competitive depends heavily on its ability to provide a continuing and timely introduction of innovative product offerings. The Company believes that the introduction of new features, designs, and models will be critical to the future success of its operations. Managing frequent product introductions poses inherent risks. Delays in the introduction or market acceptance of new models, designs, or product features could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business. Products may not be accepted for a number of reasons, including changes in consumer preferences or the Company’s failure to properly gauge consumer preferences. Further, the Company cannot be certain that new product introductions will not reduce net sales from existing models and adversely affect its results of operations. In addition, the Company’s net sales may be adversely affected if its new models and products are not introduced to the market on time or are not successful when introduced. Finally, the Company’s competitors’ new products may obtain better market acceptance. When the Company introduces new products into the marketplace, it may incur expenses that it did not anticipate, which, in turn, can result in reduced earnings. The introduction of new models, floor plans, and features are critical to the Company’s future success, however, the Company may incur unexpected expenses when it makes such introductions. For example, it may experience unexpected engineering or design flaws that may cause increased warranty costs. The costs resulting from these types of problems could be substantial and could have a significant adverse effect on the Company’s earnings. Estimated warranty costs are provided at the time of product sale to reflect the Company’s best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products. An increase in actual warranty claims costs as compared to the Company’s estimates could result in increased warranty reserves and expense which could have an adverse impact on the Company’s earnings. The Company’s products and services may experience quality problems from time to time that can result in decreased sales and gross margin and could harm the Company’s reputation. The Company’s products contain thousands of parts, many of which are supplied by a network of approved vendors. Product defects may occur, including components purchased from material vendors. The Company cannot assure that all such defects will be detected prior to the distribution of its products. In addition, although the Company endeavors to compel suppliers to maintain appropriate levels of insurance coverage, it cannot assure that if a defect in a vendor-supplied part were to occur that the vendor would have the ability to financially rectify the defect. Failure to detect defects in the Company’s products, including vendor-supplied parts, could result in lost revenue, increased warranty and related costs, and could harm the Company’s reputation. If the factory-built housing industry is not able to secure favorable local zoning ordinances, the Company’s sales could decline and its operating results and cash flows could suffer. Limitations on the number of sites available for placement of factory-built homes or on the operation of factory-built housing communities could reduce the demand for factory-built homes and, as a result, the Company’s sales. Factory-built housing communities and individual home placements are subject to local zoning ordinances and other local regulations relating to utility service and construction of roadways. In the past, some property owners have resisted the adoption of zoning ordinances permitting the use of factory-built homes in residential areas, which the Company believes has restricted the growth of the industry. Factory-built homes may not receive widespread acceptance and localities may not adopt zoning ordinances permitting the development of factory-built home communities. If the factory-built housing industry is unable to secure favorable local zoning ordinances, the Company’s sales could decline and its operating results and cash flows could suffer. The Company may not be able to manage its business effectively if it cannot retain current management team members or if it is unable to attract and motivate key personnel. Our success depends on upon the skills, experience, and active participation of our senior management and key employees, including at our Titan Factory Direct and Star Fleet Trucking operations, many of whom have been with the Company for a significant number of years. In May 2019, we announced that our Chief Executive Officer, Keith Anderson, will retire on June 1 and will be succeeded by Mark Yost, our current Executive Vice President and President of U.S. Operations. This transition, in the Company’s senior management team or other key employees, as well any future changes may result in operational disruptions and changes to the strategy of Company’s business, so the Company’s business may be harmed as a result. The Company’s business could be further disrupted and harmed if we were unable to find appropriate replacements on a timely basis following future departures. 13 Table of Contents The Company may not be able to attract or motivate qualified management and operations personnel in the future. If the Company is not able to attract and motivate necessary personnel to accomplish its business objectives, it will experience constraints tha t will significantly impede the achievement of its objectives. The Company may also have difficulty attracting experienced personnel and may be required to expend significant financial resources in its employee recruitment efforts. Product liability claims and litigation and warranty claims that arise in the ordinary course of business may be costly, which could adversely affect the Company’s business. As a home builder, the Company is subject to construction defect and home warranty claims arising in the ordinary course of business. These claims are common in the home building industry and can be costly. In addition, the costs of insuring against construction defect and product liability claims are high. There can be no assurance that this coverage will not be restricted and become more costly. If the limits or coverages of the Company’s current and former insurance programs prove inadequate, or the Company is not able to obtain adequate, or reasonably priced insurance against these types of claims in the future, or the amounts currently provided for future warranty or insurance claims are inadequate, the Company may experience losses that could negatively impact its financial results. The Company records expenses and liabilities based on the estimated costs required to cover its self-insured liability under its insurance policies, and estimated costs of potential claims and claim adjustment expenses that are above its coverage limits or that are not covered by its insurance policies. These estimated costs are based on an analysis of the Company’s historical claims and industry data, and include an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. Due to the degree of judgment required and the potential for variability in the underlying assumptions when deriving estimated liabilities, the Company’s actual future costs could differ from those estimated, and the difference could be material to its consolidated financial statements. Security breaches and other disruptions could compromise the Company’s information and expose it to liability, which would cause its business and reputation to suffer. In the ordinary course of the Company’s business, it collects and stores sensitive data, including intellectual property, its proprietary business information and that of its suppliers and business partners, as well as personally identifiable information of its customers and employees. The Company also has outsourced elements of its information technology structure, and as a result, it is managing independent vendor relationships with third parties who may or could have access to the Company’s confidential information. Similarly, the Company’s business partners and other third party providers possess certain of its sensitive data. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to the Company’s operations and business strategy. Despite its security measures, the Company’s information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance, or other disruptions. The Company, its partners, vendors, and other third party providers could be susceptible to third party attacks on the Company’s, and their, information security systems, which attacks are of ever-increasing levels of sophistication and are made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise, including criminal groups. Any such breach could compromise the Company’s networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost, or stolen. Any such access, disclosure, or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, disrupt the Company’s operations, and damage its reputation, any of which could adversely affect the Company’s business. The Company is subject to extensive regulation affecting the production and sale of factory-built housing, which could adversely affect its profitability. The Company is subject to a variety of federal, state, and local laws and regulations affecting the production and sale of factory-built housing. The Company’s failure to comply with such laws and regulations could expose it to a wide variety of sanctions, including closing one or more manufacturing facilities. Regulatory matters affecting the Company’s operations are under regular review by governmental bodies and the Company cannot predict what effect, if any, new laws and regulations would have on it or the factory-built housing industry. Failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or the passage in the future of new and more stringent laws, may adversely affect the Company’s financial condition or results of operations. The cost of operations could be adversely impacted by increased costs of healthcare benefits provided to employees. In 2010, the Affordable Care Act, was passed into law. As enacted, the health reform law changes, among other things, certain aspects of health insurance. The Affordable Care Act, coupled with the uncertainty in the insurance markets associated with the future of the Act, could increase the Company’s healthcare costs, which could adversely impact the Company’s earnings. 14 Table of Contents A prolonged delay by Congress and the President to approve budgets or continuing appropriation resolutions to facilitate the operations of the federal government could delay the completion of home sales or caus e cancellations, and thereby negatively impact the Company’s deliveries and revenues. Congress and the President may not timely approve budgets or appropriation legislation to facilitate the operations of the federal government, as was the case with the government shut-down that ended January 25, 2019. As a result, many federal agencies have historically and may again cease or curtail some activities. The affected activities include Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) verification of loan applicants’ tax return information, the funding of orders by the FEMA as part of its disaster relief efforts, and approvals by the FHA and other government agencies to fund or insure mortgage loans under programs that these agencies operate. As many of the Company’s home buyers use these programs to obtain financing to purchase its homes, and many lenders require ongoing coordination with these and other governmental entities to originate home loans, a prolonged delay in the performance of their activities could prevent prospective qualified buyers of its homes from obtaining the loans they need to complete such purchases, which could lead to delays or cancellations of home sales. These and other affected governmental bodies could cause interruptions in various aspects of the Company’s business and investments. Depending on the length of disruption, such factors could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition. Increases in the after-tax costs of owning a factory-built home could prevent potential customers from buying the Company’s products and adversely affect its business or financial results. Significant expenses of owning a factory-built home, including mortgage interest expenses and real estate taxes, generally were, under prior tax law, deductible expenses for an individual’s federal, and in some cases state, income taxes, subject to certain limitations. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, signed into law in December 2017, includes provisions that would impose limitations with respect to these income tax deductions. Increases in property tax rates or fees on developers by local governmental authorities, as experienced in response to reduced federal and state funding or to fund local initiatives, such as funding schools or road improvements, or increases in insurance premiums can adversely affect the ability of potential customers to obtain financing or their desire to purchase new homes, and can have an adverse impact on the Company’s business and financial results. The transportation industry is subject to government regulation, and regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operating results or financial condition. The Company’s Star Fleet Trucking subsidiary provides transportation services. The transportation industry is subject to legislative or regulatory changes, including potential limits on carbon emissions under climate change legislation and Department of Transportation regulations regarding, among other things, driver breaks, classification of independent drivers, “restart” rules, and the use of electronic logging devices that can affect the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or influencing the demand for, and cost of providing, transportation services. The Company may become subject to new or more restrictive regulations relating to fuel emissions or limits on vehicle weight and size. Future laws and regulations may be more stringent and require changes in operating practices, influence the demand for transportation services or increase the cost of providing transportation services, any of which could adversely affect the Company’s business and results of operations. Natural disasters and severe weather conditions could delay deliveries, increase costs, and decrease demand for new factory-built homes in affected areas. The Company’s operations are located in many areas that are subject to natural disasters and severe weather. The occurrence of natural disasters or severe weather conditions can delay factory-built home deliveries, increase costs by damaging inventories, reduce the availability of materials, and negatively impact the demand for new factory-built homes in affected areas. Furthermore, if the Company’s insurance does not fully cover business interruptions or losses resulting from these events, the Company’s earnings, liquidity, or capital resources could be adversely affected. Changes in foreign exchange rates could adversely affect the value of the Company’s investments in Canada and cause foreign exchange losses. The Company has substantial investments in businesses in Canada. Unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates could adversely affect the value of the Company’s investments in these businesses. 15 Table of Contents Following completion of the secondary o ffering of our common stock on September 25, 2018, the Company is no longer a “controlled company” under NYSE rules. However, the Company will continue to qualify for, and may rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements that would ot herwise provide protection to our shareholders during a one-year transition period. Following the completion of the secondary offering of our common stock on September 25, 2018, affiliates of Bain Capital Credit, L.P., Centerbridge Partners, L.P. and MAK Capital (collectively, the “Principal Shareholders”) ceased to control a majority of the voting power of our common stock. As a result, the Company is no longer a “controlled company” within the meaning of the NYSE corporate governance standards. Consequently, the NYSE rules will require that the Company (i) have a majority of independent directors on its board of directors within one year after the date the Company no longer qualified as a “controlled company”; (ii) have compensation and nominating and governance committees composed entirely of independent directors within one year of such date; and (iii) perform an annual performance evaluation of the compensation and nominating and governance committees. During this transition period, we will continue to qualify for and may continue to utilize the available exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements as permitted by NYSE rules. Accordingly, during the transition period, you may not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to all of the NYSE corporate governance requirements, which could make our common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price. Anti-takeover provisions in the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-Laws could prohibit a change of control that the Company’s shareholders may favor and could negatively affect the Company’s stock price. The Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-Laws contain provisions that could make it more difficult and expensive for a third party to acquire control of the Company, even if a change of control would be beneficial to the interests of the Company’s shareholders. These provisions could discourage potential takeover attempts and could adversely affect the market price of the Company’s common stock. These provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by the Company’s shareholders to replace or remove the Company’s management. For example, the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-Laws: • permit the Board of Directors to issue preferred stock with such terms as they determine, without shareholder approval; • require advance notice for shareholder proposals and director nominations; and • contain limitations on convening shareholder meetings and shareholder action by written consent. These provisions make it more difficult for shareholders or potential acquirers to acquire the Company without negotiation and could discourage potential takeover attempts and could adversely affect the market price of the Company’s common stock. The integration of Skyline and Champion Holdings may not be successful or the anticipated benefits from their combination may not be realized in their entirety. Following the consummation of the Exchange contemplated by the Exchange Agreement, the Company’s management has been integrating the operations, as well as financial and other systems, of Skyline and Champion Holdings. The Company’s management has been, and will continue to be, required to devote a great deal of time and attention to the process of integrating the operations while carrying on the ongoing operations. A significant degree of difficulty and management involvement is inherent in the integration process. The integration process includes but is not limited to: • integrating the operations while carrying on the ongoing business; • creating uniform policies, procedures, standards, internal controls, and information systems and controlling the costs associated with such matters; • integrating information technology, purchasing, accounting, sales, payroll and regulatory compliance systems; • the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding the integration process; and • integrating two business cultures, which may prove to be incompatible. 16 Table of Contents There is no assurance that the Company will be successful or cost effective at integrating the two companies. The integration may cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in the activities of the business after the consummation of the Exchange. If the Company’s management is unable to manage the integration process effectively, or any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process, the Company’s business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations m ay be adversely impacted. Even if the Company is able to combine the two business operations successfully, it may not be possible to realize the full benefits of the expected synergies, which are expected to result from the Exchange, or realize these benef its within the time frame that is expected. For example, the benefits from the Exchange may be offset by costs incurred or delays in integrating the companies. If the Company fails to realize the benefits it anticipates from the Exchange, the business, liq uidity, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. The Company incurs substantial costs as a result of operating as a public company, and the Company’s management is required to devote substantial time to compliance initiatives. As a public company, the Company currently incurs substantial legal, accounting, and other expenses. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules subsequently implemented by the SEC, impose various requirements on public companies, including requiring the establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices. The Company’s management devotes both time and financial resources to these compliance initiatives. If the Company fails to staff its accounting and finance functions adequately, or fails to maintain internal controls adequate to meet the demands that are placed upon it as a public company, including the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we may be unable to report our financial results accurately or in a timely manner and our business and stock price may suffer. The costs of being a public company, as well as diversion of management’s time and attention, may have an adverse effect on the Company’s future business. The Company’s failure to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could harm its business and financial results. The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that the Company would prevent or detect a misstatement of its financial statements or fraud. Skyline identified a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2017 as it relates to the accuracy and valuation of its inventory. Under standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, a material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The Company has completed remediation measures on this material weakness. The Company is performing initial testing of the internal control framework for Champion Holdings and these activities may divert management’s attention from other business concerns, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. If we are unable to produce accurate and timely financial statements, our stock price may be adversely affected and we may be unable to maintain compliance with applicable stock exchange listing requirements. The Company does not anticipate paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. The Company currently intends to retain our future earnings, if any, for the foreseeable future, to fund the development and growth of the Company’s business. As a result, capital appreciation in the price of the Company’s common stock, if any, will be investors’ only source of gain on an investment in the Company’s common stock. Any future determination to pay dividends to shareholders will be at the sole discretion of the Company’s board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including general economic conditions, the Company’s financial condition and results of operations, the Company’s available cash and current and anticipated cash needs, capital requirements, contractual, legal, tax and regulatory restrictions, the implications of the payment of dividends by the Company to its shareholders or by the Company’s subsidiaries to the Company and any other factors that the board of directors may deem relevant. An impairment of all or part of our goodwill could adversely affect our operating results and net worth. As of March 30, 2019, 25% of our total assets consisted of goodwill, all of which is allocated to reporting units included in the U.S. Factory-Built Housing segment. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") Accounting Standards Codification (""ASC"") 350, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other (""ASC 350""), we test goodwill at least annually for impairment or more often than annually if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment is more likely than not to have occurred. If goodwill has become impaired, we charge the impairment as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurred. See Item 7, 17 Table of Contents ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Policies"" and Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. A write off of all or part of our goodwill could adv ersely affect our results of operations and financial condition. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. ITEM 2.

We also have 21 retail sales centers located across seven states in the U.S . and nine terminals for our logistics operations across five states in the U.S. The corporate office in Troy, MI, the retail sales centers and logistics depots are leased properties. The contractual lease ter m for our Troy, Michigan corporate office expires in December 2019. Four of the above facilities are encumbered under the revolving credit facility and two of the facilities are encumbered by the industrial revenue bonds. In the opinion of management, our properties have been well maintained, are in sound operating condition and contain all equipment and facilities necessary to operate at present levels. At March 30, 2019, we also own or lease five idle manufacturing facilities that could be utilized for additional production capacity. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS We are party to certain legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course and are incidental to our business. Certain of the claims pending against us in these proceedings allege, among other things, breach of express and implied warranties, and in various governmental agency proceedings arising from occupational safety and health, wage and hour, and similar employment and workplace regulations. Although litigation is inherently uncertain, based on past experience and the information currently available, management does not believe that the currently pending and threatened litigation or claims will have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations. However, future events or circumstances, currently unknown to management, will determine whether the resolution of pending or threatened litigation or claims will ultimately have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations in any future reporting periods. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES Not applicable. 19 Table of Contents PART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES The Company's common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (""NYSE"") under the symbol SKY. As of May 17, 2019, the Company had approximately 556 holders of record of our common stock. The actual number of shareholders is greater than this number of record holders and includes shareholders who are beneficial owners but whose shares are held in street name by brokers and other nominees. This number of holders of record also does not include shareholders whose shares may be held in trust by other entities. The Company does not currently pay dividends on our common stock and intends to retain all available funds and any future earnings for general corporate purposes. However, in the future, subject to the factors described below and our future liquidity and capitalization, the Company may change this policy and choose to pay dividends. On May 31, 2018, Skyline paid a special cash dividend of $0.62381 per share of common stock to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 25, 2018. Prior to the completion of the Exchange, Champion Holdings made a capital distribution to its members equal to an aggregate of $65.3 million. Any future determination to pay dividends to shareholders will be at the sole discretion of the Company’s board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including general economic conditions, financial condition and results of operations, available cash and current and anticipated cash needs, capital requirements, contractual, legal, tax and regulatory restrictions, the implications of the payment of dividends by the Company to its shareholders or by the Company’s subsidiaries and any other factors that the board of directors may deem relevant. Stock Performance The following graph shows the cumulative total stockholder return on our common stock over the period spanning March 31, 2014 to March 31, 2019, as compared with that of the Russell 3000 Index and Cavco Industries, Inc., which the Company has determined is its most comparable publicly-traded peer in the factory-built housing segment, based on an initial investment of $100 on March 31, 2014. 20 Table of Contents Total stockholder return is measured by dividing share price change plus dividends, if any, for each period by the sh are price at the beginning of the respective period and assumes reinvestment of dividends.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following should be read in conjunction with Skyline Champion Corporation’s consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this Annual Report. Overview Champion Enterprises Holding, LLC (“Champion Holdings”) was formed as a Delaware limited liability company in 2010. Skyline Corporation (“Skyline”) was originally incorporated in Indiana in 1959. On June 1, 2018, Skyline Champion Corporation (the “Company”) was formed by Skyline and Champion Holdings combining their operations pursuant to the Share Contribution & Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”), dated as of January 5, 2018, by and between Skyline and Champion Holdings as described in further detail below. The Company is a leading producer of factory-built housing in the U.S. and Canada. The Company serves as a complete solutions provider across complementary and vertically integrated businesses including manufactured construction, company-owned retail locations, and transportation logistics services. The Company is the largest independent publicly traded factory-built solutions provider in North America based on revenue and markets its homes under several nationally recognized brand names including Skyline Homes, Champion Home Builders, Athens Park Models, Dutch Housing, Excel Homes, Homes of Merit, New Era, Redman Homes, Shore Park, Silvercrest, Titan Homes in the U.S. and Moduline and SRI Homes in western Canada. At March 30, 2019, the Company operates 31 manufacturing facilities throughout the U.S. and 5 manufacturing facilities in western Canada that primarily construct factory-built, timber-framed manufactured and modular houses that are sold primarily to independent retailers and builders/developers, including manufactured home community operators. The Company’s retail operations consist of 21 sales centers that sell manufactured homes to consumers primarily in the southern U.S. The Company’s transportation business engages independent owners/drivers to transport manufactured homes and recreational vehicles throughout the U.S. and Canada. Acquisitions and Expansions Over the last several years, market demand for the Company’s products, primarily affordable housing in the U.S., has continued to improve. As a result, the Company has focused on operational improvements to make existing manufacturing facilities more profitable as well as executing measured expansion of its manufacturing and retail footprint. In response to the increasing demand for factory-built housing in the U.S., the Company has increased capacity through strategic acquisitions and expansions of its manufacturing footprint. The Company is focused on growing in strong HUD-markets across the U.S. as well as further expanding into the Northeast and Midwest U.S. modular housing markets. During the third quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company completed its expansion of the Corona, California facility by adding a second production line. In October 2017, the Company entered into a lease for two factory-built housing plants in Leesville, Louisiana, one of which the Company expects to begin operations in June 2019. The Company is expanding its Leola, Pennsylvania campus and opened an additional plant in April 2019. In September 2016, the Company, through a series of transactions, completed the purchase of the assets of Innovative Building Systems, LLC and its subsidiaries (“IBS” or the “IBS Acquisition”), which included five modular manufacturing facilities and two retail sales centers in the Northeast and Midwest U.S. In January 2017, the Company restarted operations at the Liverpool, Pennsylvania location, one of the acquired modular facilities from IBS. The other former IBS facilities and retail lots remain idle. In addition to these strategic acquisitions, during fiscal 2017, the Company leased and opened a manufacturing facility in Benton, Kentucky as well as reopened a previously idled facility in Topeka, Indiana. The Topeka facility began operations in February 2017. Production at the Benton facility began in August 2016. The Company has also focused on expansion of its company-owned retail operations, opening three additional retail sales centers during fiscal 2018 and five during fiscal 2017. Management believes retail expansion provides an opportunity to increase the Company’s presence in market segments that are not currently served through its independent retail network, while also providing for expansion and increased utilization of existing manufacturing operations. These acquisitions and investments are part of a strategy to grow and diversify revenue with a focus on increasing the Company’s HUD and modular homebuilding presence in the U.S. as well as improving the results of operations. These acquisitions and investments are included in the consolidated results for periods subsequent to their respective acquisition dates. 23 Table of Contents Combination with Skyline On January 5, 2018, Champion Holdings and Skyline entered into an Exchange Agreement pursuant to which the two companies agreed to combine their operations. The Exchange was completed on June 1, 2018 and was accounted for as a reverse acquisition under the acquisition method of accounting as provided by FASB Accounting Standards Codification 805, Business Combinations (“ASC 805”). Champion Holdings was determined to be the acquirer for accounting and financial reporting purposes. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed by Champion Holdings as a result of the Exchange were recorded at their respective fair values and added to the carrying value of Champion Holdings existing assets and liabilities. As Champion Holdings is the accounting acquirer, reported financial results for Skyline Champion Corporation for fiscal 2019 are comprised of: 1) the results of Champion Holdings through June 1, 2018 and 2) the combined operations of the Company, after giving effect to the Exchange, from June 1, 2018 through March 30, 2019. All fiscal periods presented prior to fiscal 2019 are comprised solely of the results of Champion Holdings, unless otherwise noted. Industry and Company Outlook For fiscal 2019, approximately 76% of the Company’s U.S. manufacturing sales were generated from the manufacture of homes that comply with the Federal HUD-code construction standard in the U.S. During fiscal 2019, industry shipments of HUD-code homes were 93,377 (or 93,265 excluding FEMA) units compared to 95,044 (or 90,629 excluding FEMA) units shipped in same period of the prior year. The Company’s HUD market share during those periods was 16.6% versus 13.9% in the comparable period of the prior year. Sales of HUD-code homes have increased since 2009, when 50,000 HUD-code homes were sold. Fewer factory-built homes were sold in 2009 than in any year since 1959. While HUD-code factory-built home shipments have improved modestly over the past few years, the industry continues to operate at relatively low levels compared to historical shipment statistics. For instance, the long-term average for manufactured home shipments since 1960 is approximately 222,000 units per year. The Company measures and reports on U.S. modular market share three months in arrears. Industry shipments of modular homes in the U.S. of 15,530 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 was 9.8% higher than the 14,149 units shipped in the comparable period of 2017. The Company’s modular market share during these periods was 13.1% and 11.1%, respectively. Modular home sales across the industry have generally been stable since 2009. During fiscal 2019, approximately 18% of the Company’s U.S. manufacturing sales were modular. The Company’s modular home presence has improved, in part, due to the IBS Acquisition. 24 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2019 VS. 2018 Year Ended (Dollars in thousands) March 30, 2019 March 31, 2018 Results of Operations Data: Net sales $ 1,360,043 $ 1,064,722 Cost of sales 1,114,684 887,611 Gross profit 245,359 177,111 Selling, general and administrative expenses 275,101 122,522 Operating (loss) income (29,742 ) 54,589 Interest expense, net 3,290 4,185 Other expense 8,271 7,288 (Loss) income from operations before income taxes (41,303 ) 43,116 Income tax expense 16,905 27,316 Net (loss) income $ (58,208 ) $ 15,800 Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA: Net (loss) income $ (58,208 ) $ 15,800 Income tax expense 16,905 27,316 Interest expense, net 3,290 4,185 Depreciation and amortization 16,079 8,260 Equity-based compensation (for awards granted prior to December 31, 2018) 101,025 642 Foreign currency transaction loss (gain) 123 (548 ) Transaction costs 8,201 7,267 Acquisition integration costs 7,966 406 Restructuring costs 1,640 — Gain on sale of non-operating facilities — (106 ) Lower of cost or market adjustment of development inventory — 1,165 Other 70 221 Adjusted EBITDA $ 97,091 $ 64,608 As a percent of net sales: Gross profit 18.0 % 16.6 % Selling, general and administrative expenses 20.2 % 11.5 % Operating (loss) income (2.2 %) 5.1 % Net (loss) income (4.3 %) 1.5 % Adjusted EBITDA 7.1 % 6.1 % 25 Table of Contents N ET SALES The following table summarizes net sales for fiscal 2019 and 2018: Year Ended (Dollars in thousands) March 30, 2019 March 31, 2018 Change % Change Net sales $ 1,360,043 $ 1,064,722 $ 295,321 27.7 % U.S. manufacturing and retail net sales $ 1,177,687 $ 860,488 $ 317,199 36.9 % U.S. homes sold 19,443 16,140 3,303 20.5 % U.S. manufacturing and retail average home selling price $ 60.6 $ 53.3 $ 7.3 13.6 % Canadian manufacturing net sales $ 98,567 $ 96,603 $ 1,964 2.0 % Canadian homes sold 1,232 1,266 (34 ) (2.7 %) Canadian manufacturing average home selling price $ 80.0 $ 76.3 $ 4 4.8 % Corporate/Other net sales $ 83,789 $ 107,631 $ (23,842 ) (22.2 %) U.S. manufacturing facilities in operation at year end 31 23 8 34.8 % U.S. retail sales centers in operation at year end 21 21 — — % Canadian manufacturing facilities in operation at year end 5 5 — — % Net sales for fiscal 2019 were $1,360.0 million, an increase of $295.3 million, or 27.7% over fiscal 2018. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. U.S. Factory-built Housing: The U.S. Factory-built Housing segment accounted for the majority of the overall growth in net sales for fiscal 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year. Sales of homes for the Company’s U.S. manufacturing and retail operations increased by $317.2 million, or 36.9%. The number of homes sold during fiscal 2019 increased by 3,303 units, or 20.5%. The net sales increase was attributable to the following factors including: (i) the inclusion of net sales of $218.8 million for the Skyline operations for the period following the completion of the Exchange; and (ii) a 13.6% increase in the average home selling price as a result of product mix and pricing actions to offset the impact of fluctuating material and labor costs. The Company’s U.S. HUD market share for fiscal 2019 grew to 16.6% from 13.9% in the prior year due, primarily, to the inclusion of Skyline operations. U.S. HUD industry units shipped during fiscal 2019 were 93,377 which represented a slight decrease from the 95,044 units in the prior year. U.S. HUD industry shipments for fiscal 2019 did not include any FEMA disaster relief homes, according to data published by the Manufactured Housing Institute. Fiscal 2019 industry shipments include the sale of 112 disaster relief homes produced for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (“FEMA”) compared to 4,415 in fiscal 2018. Canadian Factory-built Housing: The Canadian Factory-built Housing segment net sales increased by $2.0 million, or 2.0% for fiscal 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a 4.8% increase in average selling price, which was a result of pricing actions taken by the Company to offset the impact of rising material and labor costs. This increase was offset by a 2.7% decrease in homes sold. Net sales had an unfavorable impact of $1.9 million as a result of changes in exchange rates utilized for translation of Canadian dollars to U.S. dollars during fiscal 2019 as compared to the same period of the prior year. Corporate/Other: Net sales for Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation business and the elimination of intersegment sales. For fiscal 2019, net sales decreased $23.8 million, or 22.2%. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower net sales in the Company’s transportation business primarily as a result of lower shipments associated with reduced RV demand in the U.S. 26 Table of Contents GROSS PROFIT The following table summarizes gross profit for fiscal 2019 and 2018 : Year Ended (Dollars in thousands) March 30, 2019 March 31, 2018 Change % Change Gross profit: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 214,142 $ 143,632 $ 70,510 49.1 % Canadian Factory-built Housing 18,309 18,415 (106 ) (0.6 %) Corporate/Other 12,908 15,064 (2,156 ) (14.3 %) Total gross profit $ 245,359 $ 177,111 $ 68,248 38.5 % Gross profit as a percent of net sales 18.0 % 16.6 % Gross profit as a percent of sales during fiscal 2019 was 18.0% compared to 16.6% during fiscal 2018. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. U.S. Factory-built Housing: Gross profit for the U.S. Factory-built Housing segment increased by $70.5 million, or 49.1%, during fiscal 2019 compared to the prior year. Gross profit was 18.2% as a percent of segment net sales for fiscal 2019 compared to 16.7% in the prior year. The 150 basis point increase in gross profit as a percent of sales is due to a combination of factors. The Company has benefited from the synergy capture from the Exchange with Skyline and continues to standardize its core product design and material purchases which allow for more efficient production for its supply chain and helps to mitigate material commodity fluctuations. The Company also continues to focus on better understanding its cost structure and discontinuing models and options that customers do not value. Canadian Factory-built Housing: Gross profit for the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment decreased $0.1 million, or 0.6%, during fiscal 2019 compared to the prior year and decreased to 18.6% as a percent of segment net sales from 19.1%. The decrease is primarily due to lower sales volume. Corporate/Other: Gross profit for the Corporate/Other segment decreased $2.2 million, or 14.3%, during fiscal 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year. However, Corporate/Other gross profit improved as a percent of segment net sales to 15.4% from 14.0%. Although overall the transportation business activity was lower than the prior year, gross margins improved as a percent of sales due to product mix. 27 Table of Contents SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE S Selling, general and administrative expenses include foreign currency transaction gains and losses, equity compensation and intangible amortization expense. The following table summarizes selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2019 and 2018: Year Ended (Dollars in thousands) March 30, 2019 March 31, 2018 Change % Change Selling, general and administrative expenses: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 116,379 $ 83,486 $ 32,893 39.4 % Canadian Factory-built Housing 9,058 8,768 290 3.3 % Corporate/Other 149,664 30,268 119,396 394.5 % Total selling, general and administrative expenses $ 275,101 $ 122,522 $ 152,579 124.5 % Selling, general and administrative expense as a percent of net sales 20.2 % 11.5 % Selling, general and administrative expenses were $275.1 million for fiscal 2019, an increase of $152.6 million compared to the prior year. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. U.S. Factory-built Housing: Selling, general and administrative expenses for the U.S. Factory-built Housing segment increased $32.9 million, or 39.4%, during fiscal 2019 as compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily a result of an increase of $14.5 million related to the inclusion of the Skyline operations subsequent to the Exchange, an increase of $8.7 million related to higher sales commissions and incentive compensation (which is generally based on sales volume or a measure of profitability), an increase of $4.3 million for additional amortization related to the Exchange, an increase of approximately $1.0 million related to investments in plant ramp up of previously idled facilities, and $1.9 million of other administrative and marketing costs. As a result of the increases above, selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percent of segment net sales, was 9.9% for fiscal 2019 compared to 9.7% during fiscal 2018. Canadian Factory-built Housing: Selling, general and administrative expenses for the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment increased $0.3 million, or 3.3%, during fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018. As a percent of segment net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses for the Canadian segment was 9.2% for fiscal 2019 compared to 9.1% for fiscal 2018. Corporate/Other: Selling, general and administrative expenses for Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation operations, corporate costs incurred for all segments and intersegment eliminations. Selling, general and administrative expenses for Corporate/Other increased $119.4 million during fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018. The increase is primarily a result of an increase of $101.4 million in non-cash, equity-based compensation expense, an increase of $7.6 million increase for Skyline integration costs, an increase of $3.1 million of costs related to the inclusion of the Skyline corporate departments subsequent to the Exchange, an increase of $2.4 million in legal and professional fees, and an increase of $1.6 million of restructuring costs primarily related to redundant corporate and administrative costs subsequent to the Exchange. 28 Table of Contents INTEREST EXPENSE The following table summarizes the components of interest expense, net for fiscal 2019 and 2018: Year Ended (Dollars in thousands) March 30, 2019 March 31, 2018 Change % Change Interest expense $ 5,333 $ 5,133 $ 200 3.9 % Interest income (2,043 ) (948 ) (1,095 ) 115.5 % Interest expense, net $ 3,290 $ 4,185 $ (895 ) (21.4 %) Average outstanding floor plan payable $ 32,288 $ 21,739 Average outstanding long-term debt $ 58,959 $ 59,604 Interest expense, net was $3.3 million for fiscal 2019, a decrease of $0.9 million compared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily related to higher interest income recognized during the period as a result of higher average cash balances invested in short term facilities. OTHER EXPENSE The following table summarizes other expense for fiscal 2019 and 2018: Year Ended (Dollars in thousands) March 30, 2019 March 31, 2018 Change % Change Other expense $ 8,271 $ 7,288 $ 983 13.5 % Other expense for fiscal 2019 primarily consisted of $8.2 million of expenses for legal, accounting, and advisory services related to the Exchange and four offerings of the Company’s common stock subsequent to the Exchange (“Offerings”), as well as $0.1 million for the deductible on an insured loss at one of the Company’s retail sales centers. During fiscal 2018, the Company incurred $7.3 million of expenses related to legal and accounting services associated with the Exchange. INCOME TAX EXPENSE The following table summarizes income tax expense for fiscal 2019 and 2018: Year Ended (Dollars in thousands) March 30, 2019 March 31, 2018 Change % Change Income tax expense $ 16,905 $ 27,316 $ (10,411 ) (38.1 %) Effective tax rate (40.9 %) 63.4 % Income tax expense for fiscal 2019 was $16.9 million, representing an effective tax rate of (40.9)%, compared to income tax expense of $27.3 million, representing an effective tax rate of 63.4%, for fiscal 2018. The Company’s effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of 21.0%, due primarily to the effect of non-deductible expenses, many of which were a result of the Exchange, state and local income taxes, and results in foreign jurisdictions. The Company’s effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 differed from the blended federal statutory rate of 31.5% primarily due to the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new corporate income tax rate of 21%, from 35% due to the comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act ”) as well as the effect of non-deductible expense, state and local income taxes, and results of operations in foreign jurisdictions and non-taxable entities. 29 Table of Contents A DJUSTED EBITDA The following table reconciles net income, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, to Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, for fiscal 2019 and 2018: Year Ended (Dollars in thousands) March 30, 2019 March 31, 2018 Change % Change Net (loss) income $ (58,208 ) $ 15,800 $ (74,008 ) * Income tax expense 16,905 27,316 (10,411 ) (38.1 %) Interest expense, net 3,290 4,185 (895 ) (21.4 %) Depreciation and amortization 16,079 8,260 7,819 94.7 % Equity-based compensation (for awards granted prior to December 31, 2018) 101,025 642 100,383 * Foreign currency transaction loss (gain) 123 (548 ) 671 (122.4 %) Transaction costs 8,201 7,267 934 12.9 % Acquisition integration costs 7,966 406 7,560 * Restructuring costs 1,640 — 1,640 * Gain on sale of non-operating facilities — (106 ) 106 * Lower of cost or market adjustment of development inventory — 1,165 (1,165 ) * Other 70 221 (151 ) (68.3 %) Adjusted EBITDA $ 97,091 $ 64,608 $ 32,483 50.3 % * indicates that the calculated percentage is not meaningful Adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2019 was $97.1 million, an increase of $32.5 million over fiscal 2018. The increase is primarily a result of increased operating income after adjusting for the effect of increased depreciation and amortization, transaction, integration, restructuring costs and non-cash equity-based compensation incurred in connection with the Exchange, and the Offerings and the integration of Skyline. The increase in operating income is primarily due to improvements in sales volumes and gross profit margins as a percent of net sales partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative costs. See Adjusted EBITDA definition under Non GAAP Measures below for additional information regarding the definition and use of this metric in evaluating the Company’s results. Pro Forma Results of Operations In addition to the analysis of historical results of operations, this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes unaudited supplemental pro forma results of operations for the fiscal 2019 and 2018. The unaudited pro forma results of operations reflect pro forma adjustments to the results of the Company to give effect to the Exchange and the related financing transactions (the “Financing”) as if they had occurred on April 2, 2017, the beginning of fiscal 2018. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information of the Company combines the accounting periods of Champion Holdings and Skyline Corporation. Champion Holdings and Skyline had different fiscal year ends. Regulation S-X, Rule 11-02(c)(3) allows the combination of financial information for companies if their fiscal years end within 93 days of each other. Skyline’s results for these periods were derived from their unaudited consolidated income statements. Champion Holdings’ historical results are derived from Champion Holdings’ consolidated statements of operations for fiscal 2019 and 2018. The unaudited pro forma adjustments, for activities up to the date of the Exchange, include: • Adjustments to depreciation expense for the stepped-up basis of property, plant and equipment; • Adjustments to the amortization of intangible assets recognized in connection with the Exchange; • Adjustments to interest expense for the elimination of historical interest expense and amortization of deferred financing fees on retired debt; • Recognition of interest expense and amortization of deferred financing fees on the new revolving credit agreement; 30 Table of Contents • Adjustments to eliminate expenses incurred directly related to the Exchange; • Adjustments to eliminate one-time equity-based compensation incurred directly related to the Exchange; • Adjustments to eliminate the net currency translation gains and losses on certain intercompany debt; • Adjustments to eliminate the management fee, plus reimbursable expenses, paid by Champion Holdings to its primary investors under a management service agreement; and • Adjustments to reflect tax expense for the unaudited pro forma adjustments Year Ended (Dollars in thousands) March 30, 2019 March 31, 2018 (unaudited) Pro Forma Results of Operations Data: Net sales $ 1,405,847 $ 1,297,159 Cost of sales 1,152,772 1,090,349 Gross profit 253,075 206,810 Selling, general and administrative expenses 272,277 148,475 Operating (loss) income (19,202 ) 58,335 Interest expense, net 3,175 3,797 Other expense 1,858 94 (Loss) income from operations before income taxes (24,235 ) 54,444 Income tax expense 19,225 28,789 Net (loss) income $ (43,460 ) $ 25,655 Reconciliation of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA: Net (loss) income $ (43,460 ) $ 25,655 Income tax expense 19,225 28,789 Interest expense, net 3,175 3,797 Depreciation and amortization 17,244 16,065 Equity-based compensation (for awards granted prior to December 31, 2018) 93,132 916 Foreign currency transaction loss (gain) 123 (176 ) Transaction costs 1,788 — Acquisition integration costs 7,966 386 Restructuring costs 1,640 1,132 Gain on sale of non-operating facilities — (2,104 ) Lower of cost or market adjustment of development inventory — 1,165 Other 70 328 Adjusted EBITDA $ 100,903 $ 75,953 As a percent of net sales: Gross profit 18.0 % 15.9 % Selling, general and administrative expenses 19.4 % 11.4 % Operating (loss) income (1.4 %) 4.5 % Net (loss) income (3.1 %) 2.0 % Adjusted EBITDA 7.2 % 5.9 % Pro Forma Net Sales: Pro forma net sales for fiscal 2019 were $1,405.8 million compared to $1,297.2 million in the prior year, an increase of $108.6 million. The increase was attributable to an increase in number of units sold, and an increase in the average home selling price as a result of product mix and pricing actions to offset the impact of fluctuating material and labor costs and plant operating improvements. 31 Table of Contents Pro Forma Gross Profit: Pro forma gross profit increased $ 46 . 3 million during fiscal 2019 the compared to the same period of the prior year and improved as a percent of net sales to 18.0 % from 15.9 %. The increase in gross profit as a percent of net sales is consistent with the synergy capture, operational improvements and product rationalization actions taken by the Company as discussed above . The continued standardization of product design and mate rial purchases has allowed for more efficient production for the Company and its supply chain and helped to mitigate the effects of commodity and labor fluctuations occurring in the market place. Pro Forma Selling, General and Administrative Expenses: Pro forma selling, general and administrative expenses were $272.3 million for fiscal 2019 as compared to $148.5 million for fiscal 2018. The increase was primarily the result of increased non-cash, equity-based compensation expense of $92.2 million, increased sales commissions and incentive compensation of $9.4 million (which is generally based on sales volume or a measure of profitability), and increased costs incurred with the integration of the Skyline operations of $7.6 million. Pro Forma Interest Expense, Net: Pro forma interest expense, net was $3.2 million for fiscal 2019, a decrease of $0.6 million from the same period of the prior year. The overall decrease is primarily attributable to additional interest income earned from higher average cash balances invested in short-term facilities. Pro Forma Other Expense: Other expense for fiscal 2019 primarily consists of expenses for legal, accounting and advisory services attributable to the Exchange and the Offerings. Pro Forma Income Tax Expense: During fiscal 2019, the Company had pro forma income tax expense of $19.2 million and an effective tax rate of (79.3%), compared to income tax expense of $28.8 million at an effective tax rate of 52.9% during fiscal 2018. Prior to the completion of the Exchange, Skyline recognized no income tax expense or benefit as a result of historical operating loss carryforwards which had a full valuation allowance. A portion of the valuation allowance was reversed upon completion of the Exchange, however, that reversal did not have an impact on the pro forma results of operations. The pro forma income tax effects are a result of the income tax effects of the Company discussed above plus the tax impact of the pro forma adjustments. BACKLOG Although orders from customers can be cancelled at any time without penalty, and unfilled orders are not necessarily an indication of future business, the Company’s unfilled U.S. and Canadian manufacturing orders for homes at March 30, 2019 totaled $142.7 million compared to $154.8 million at March 31, 2018. Although backlog increased as a result of the Exchange, overall it was lower than the prior year. Backlog at March 31, 2018 was higher than normal in part a result of pent up demand for core products caused by the production of FEMA units in the third and fourth fiscal quarters of fiscal 2018. In addition, backlog for the Canadian operations was lower due to an overall softening in the Canadian economy and housing markets. 32 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018 VS. 2017 Year Ended (Dollars in thousands) March 31, 2018 April 1, 2017 Results of Operations Data: Net sales $ 1,064,722 $ 861,319 Cost of sales 887,611 717,364 Gross profit 177,111 143,955 Selling, general and administrative expenses 122,522 109,305 Operating income 54,589 34,650 Interest expense, net 4,185 4,264 Other expense 7,288 2,380 Income from continuing operations before income taxes 43,116 28,006 Income tax expense (benefit) 27,316 (23,321 ) Net income from continuing operating 15,800 51,327 Gain from discontinued operations — (583 ) Net Income $ 15,800 $ 51,910 Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA: Net income from continuing operating $ 15,800 $ 51,910 Gain from discontinued operations — (583 ) Income tax expense 27,316 (23,321 ) Interest expense, net 4,185 4,264 Depreciation and amortization 8,260 7,245 Equity-based compensation 642 608 Foreign currency transaction (gain) loss (548 ) 3,688 Transaction costs 7,267 2,356 Acquisition integration costs 406 — Gain on sale of non-operating facilities (106 ) (902 ) Lower of cost or market adjustment of development inventory 1,165 — Other 221 182 Adjusted EBITDA $ 64,608 $ 45,447 As a percent of net sales: Gross profit 16.6 % 16.7 % Selling, general and administrative expenses 11.5 % 12.7 % Operating income 5.1 % 4.0 % Net income from continuing operating 1.5 % 6.0 % Adjusted EBITDA 6.1 % 5.3 % 33 Table of Contents NET SALES The following table summarizes net sales for the fiscal 2018 and 2017: Year Ended (Dollars in thousands) March 31, 2018 April 1, 2017 Change % Change Net sales $ 1,064,722 $ 861,319 $ 203,403 23.6 % U.S. manufacturing and retail net sales $ 860,488 $ 678,296 $ 182,192 26.9 % U.S. homes sold 16,140 13,187 2,953 22.4 % U.S. manufacturing and retail average home selling price $ 53.3 $ 51.4 $ 1.9 3.7 % Canadian manufacturing net sales $ 96,603 $ 92,631 $ 3,972 4.3 % Canadian homes sold 1,266 1,261 5 0.4 % Canadian manufacturing average home selling price $ 76.3 $ 73.5 $ 3 3.9 % Corporate/Other net sales $ 107,631 $ 90,392 $ 17,239 19.1 % U.S. manufacturing facilities in operation at year end 23 22 1 U.S. retail sales centers in operation at year end 21 18 3 Canadian manufacturing facilities in operation at year end 5 5 –– Net sales for fiscal 2018 were $1,064.7 million, an increase of $203.4 million or 23.6% over fiscal 2017. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. U.S. Factory-built Housing: The U.S. Factory-built Housing segment accounted for the majority of the overall growth in net sales for fiscal 2018. Net sales of homes for both the U.S. manufacturing and retail operations increased by $182.2 million, or 26.9%, compared to net sales in fiscal 2017. The number of homes sold in fiscal 2018 increased by 2,953 units, or 22.4%, compared to fiscal 2017. This increase was attributable to several factors including: (i) increased manufacturing capacity in fiscal 2018 as a result of the footprint expansion actions in fiscal 2017; (ii) additional retail sales centers in operation during the year; (iii) the Company’s ability to generate additional output at its existing facilities to meet increasing market demand as a result of plant operating improvements; and (iv) a 3.7% increase in the average home selling price in fiscal 2018 as a result of increased market demand and pricing actions to offset the impact of rising material and labor costs. During fiscal 2018, net sales at manufacturing and retail sales centers opened during fiscal 2018 and 2017 had incremental sales of $103.6 million year-over-year as compared to fiscal 2017. As a result of the capacity and operational improvements discussed above, the Company’s U.S. HUD market share for fiscal 2018 grew to 13.9% from 12.7% in fiscal 2017. The overall market also grew during the Company’s fiscal 2018 as shipments of factory-built HUD homes were 11.1% higher than the same period of the prior year. Canadian Factory-built Housing: The Canadian Factory-built Housing segment net sales increased $4.0 million in fiscal 2018, compared to fiscal 2017, primarily as the result of an increase in average selling price of 3.8% on essentially equivalent homes sold volume. Sales growth in the Canadian markets, particularly in Alberta and Saskatchewan, continued to lag increases in other markets as a result of the economic impact in Canada of reduced oil prices in recent years. The increase in average selling price is primarily a result of pricing actions to offset the effect of higher material and labor costs, similar to those impacting the U.S. Factory-built Housing segment. Additionally, during the Company’s fiscal 2018, the Canadian dollar strengthened in relation to the U.S. dollar resulting in an increase in net sales of approximately $2.1 million, compared to fiscal 2017. Corporate/Other: Net sales for corporate/other include the Company’s transportation business and the elimination of intersegment sales. The 19.1% increase in fiscal 2018 from 2017 was driven by higher delivery activity of recreational vehicles caused by increasing industry demand. 34 Table of Contents GROSS PROFIT The following table summarizes gross profit for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 and April 1, 2017: Year Ended (Dollars in thousands) March 31, 2018 April 1, 2017 Change % Change Gross profit: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 143,632 $ 110,418 $ 33,214 30.1 % Canadian Factory-built Housing 18,415 19,425 (1,010 ) (5.2 %) Corporate/Other 15,064 14,112 952 6.7 % Total gross profit $ 177,111 $ 143,955 $ 33,156 23.0 % Gross profit as a percent of net sales 16.6 % 16.7 % Gross profit as a percent of net sales was 16.6% in fiscal 2018 compared to 16.7% in fiscal 2017. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. U.S. Factory-built Housing: Gross profit for the U.S. Factory-built Housing segment increased by $33.2 million in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 and improved to 16.7% as a percent of segment net sales from 16.3% in fiscal 2017. The increase was a result of a combination of the additional sales volume discussed above and higher gross margins. Although material prices and labor costs have been increasing in recent periods, the Company was able to offset those effects with price increases, operational improvements and product rationalization. The Company continued to standardize product design and material purchases which allowed for more seamless production for its supply chain and helped to mitigate the commodity inflation occurring in the marketplace. In the same effort to streamline production, the Company continued to focus on better understanding its cost structure and discontinued models and options that customers did not value. Finally, the U.S. manufacturing plants have increased output which allowed for better leverage of fixed costs. Canadian Factory-built Housing: Gross profit for the Canadian Factory-built Housing segment decreased by $1.0 million during fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 and declined to 19.1% as a percent of segment net sales from 21.0% in fiscal 2017. Due to general economic conditions in western Canada, the operations were not able to entirely offset the effects of commodity inflation and rising labor costs. In addition, gross profit was lower as a percent of net sales as a result of a shift in product mix. Corporate/Other: Corporate/Other gross profit increased $1.0 million in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017, however, as a percent of segment net sales decreased to 14.0% from 15.6% in fiscal 2017. The decrease was primarily the result of an increase in brokerage activity that experiences lower gross profits than traditional delivery operations. 35 Table of Contents SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPE N SES : The following table summarizes selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 and April 1, 2017: Year Ended (Dollars in thousands) March 31, 2018 April 1, 2017 Change % Change Selling, general and administrative expenses: U.S. Factory-built Housing $ 83,486 $ 67,872 $ 15,614 23.0 % Canadian Factory-built Housing 8,768 7,819 949 12.1 % Corporate/Other 30,268 33,614 (3,346 ) (10.0 %) Total selling, general and administrative expenses $ 122,522 $ 109,305 $ 13,217 12.1 % Selling, general and administrative expense as a percent of net sales 11.5 % 12.7 % Selling, general and administrative expenses were $122.5 million in fiscal 2018, an increase of $13.2 million from fiscal 2017. The following is a summary of the change by operating segment. U.S Factory-built Housing: The U.S. Factory-built Housing segment had a $15.6 million increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily the result of: (i) an increase in salaries and benefits of $5.4 million, generally a result of increased compensation and administrative headcount to facilitate expanding capacity; (ii) incentive compensation, which is generally based on a measure of profitability, was $4.6 million higher in fiscal 2018 than in fiscal 2017; and (iii) other administrative costs, including professional fees, IT and sales and marketing costs, which were $1.8 million higher in fiscal 2018, generally a result of required support for growth. Although total costs were higher, as a percent of segment net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2018 were 9.7% compared to 10.0% in fiscal 2017. Canadian Factory-built Housing: The Canadian Factory-built Housing segment had a 12.1% increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily due to the effect of the translation of foreign denominated cash, which has an unfavorable year-over-year impact of $0.6 million. As a percent of segment net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses for the Canadian segment was 9.1% in fiscal 2018 and 8.4% in 2017. Corporate/Other: Selling, general and administrative costs for Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation operations, corporate costs incurred for all segments and intersegment eliminations. The decrease of $3.3 million in fiscal 2018 from 2017 was primarily due to gains and losses on certain intercompany debt denominated in foreign currencies. In fiscal 2017, currency losses were $4.0 million compared to currency gains of $0.8 million in fiscal 2018. The intercompany debt was retired subsequent to March 31, 2018 per the terms of the Exchange Agreement. The remaining selling, general and administrative costs were higher in fiscal 2018 primarily as a result of increased incentive compensation. 36 Table of Contents INTER EST EXPENSE, NET The following table summarizes the components of interest expense, net for fiscal 2018 and 2017: Year Ended (Dollars in thousands) March 31, 2018 April 1, 2017 Change % Change Interest expense $ 5,133 $ 4,646 $ 487 10.5 % Interest income (948 ) (382 ) (566 ) (148.2 %) Interest expense, net $ 4,185 $ 4,264 $ (79 ) (1.9 %) Average outstanding floor plan payable $ 21,739 $ 16,975 Average outstanding long-term debt $ 59,604 $ 59,980 Interest expense, net was $4.2 million in fiscal 2018, a decrease of $0.1 million from fiscal 2017. The overall change related to increases in both interest income and expense during the period that generally offset. Interest expense increased $0.5 million as a result of the increase in average outstanding borrowings on floor plan financing arrangements. Floor plan payables were used to finance retail inventory at company-owned retail sales centers and the increase in outstanding borrowings is consistent with the expanded footprint for the U.S. retail operations discussed above. Interest income increased $0.6 million as a result of an increase in interest generated from higher average cash balances on hand throughout fiscal 2018 and increased investments in short-term cash equivalents. OTHER EXPENSE The following table summarizes other expense for fiscal 2018 and 2017: Year Ended (Dollars in thousands) March 31, 2018 April 1, 2017 Change % Change Other expense $ 7,288 $ 2,380 $ 4,908 206.2 % Other expense for fiscal 2018 primarily consists of $7.2 million of legal, accounting and other transaction costs for the Exchange. Other expense for fiscal 2017 primarily consists of $1.7 million of costs for the IBS Acquisition and the acquisition of new retail sales centers, and $0.4 million of legal and accounting fees related to the disposition of the Company’s U.K. operations. Income Tax Expense (Benefit) The following table summarizes income tax expense (benefit) for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 and April 1, 2017: Year Ended (Dollars in thousands) March 31, 2018 April 1, 2017 Change % Change Income tax expense $ 27,316 $ (23,321 ) $ 50,637 (217.1 %) Effective tax rate 63.4 % (83.3 %) During fiscal 2018, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Act which made several changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, including among other things, a reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. Since the Company’s fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, the current U.S. corporate income tax rate under the Tax Act was a blended rate of 31.5%. The effective tax rate in fiscal 2018 was higher than the federal statutory blended rate of 31.5%, largely attributable to the recognition of a $3.3 million foreign investment basis difference and $9.4 million of tax expense due to the deferred tax rate change as a result of the Tax Act. The negative effective tax rate in fiscal 2017 was primarily a result of a $35.9 million income tax benefit recognized for the release of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets in the U.S. During fiscal 2017, the Company evaluated the realizability of its deferred tax assets and determined it was more likely than not that its net deferred tax assets would be realized. 37 Table of Contents Gain from Discontinued Operations The following table summarizes gain from discontinued operations for fiscal 2018 and 2017: Year Ended (Dollars in thousands) March 31, 2018 April 1, 2017 Change % Change Gain from discontinued operations $ — $ (583 ) $ 583 (100.0 %) During fiscal 2016, the Company committed to a plan to dispose of its U.K. operations, and therefore, classified the results of operations of its U.K. subsidiaries as discontinued and the assets and liabilities as held for sale. The Company recognized a net gain on discontinued operations in fiscal 2017 of $0.6 million. The net gain includes the U.K. operating losses for the period up to the disposition and the net impact of recognizing historical cumulative translation adjustments upon the final disposition. The sale of the U.K. operations was completed on January 20, 2017. Prior to the disposition, the Company accounted for cumulative currency translation adjustments on invested assets and liabilities, and pension actuarial losses in accumulated other comprehensive income. Upon final disposition, $8.3 million of net cumulative gains for these items were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to net income. Adjusted EBITDA The following table reconciles net income, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, to Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, for fiscal 2018 and 2017: Year Ended (Dollars in thousands) March 31, 2018 April 1, 2017 Change % Change Net income $ 15,800 $ 51,910 $ (36,110 ) (69.6 %) Gain from discontinued operations — (583 ) 583 * Income tax expense 27,316 (23,321 ) 50,637 * Interest expense, net 4,185 4,264 (79 ) (1.9 %) Depreciation and amortization 8,260 7,245 1,015 14.0 % Equity-based compensation 642 608 34 5.6 % Foreign currency transaction gain (548 ) 3,688 (4,236 ) (114.9 %) Transaction costs 7,267 2,356 4,911 * Acquisition integration costs 406 — 406 * Gain on sale of non-operating facilities (106 ) (902 ) 796 (88.2 %) Lower of cost or market adjustment of developmental inventory 1,165 — 1,165 * Other 221 182 39 21.4 % Adjusted EBITDA $ 64,608 $ 45,447 $ 19,161 42.2 % * indicates that the calculated percentage is not meaningful. Adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2018 was $64.6 million, an increase of $19.2 million over fiscal 2017. The primary driver of the change from fiscal 2017 was a $19.9 million increase in operating income which was driven by the increase in operating activities and the relative reduction in direct and indirect operating expenses as a percent of sales as discussed above. See Adjusted EBITDA definition under Non GAAP Measures below for additional information regarding the definition and use of this metric in evaluating the Company’s results. 38 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The following table presents summary cash flow information for fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017: Year Ended (Dollars in thousands) March 30, 2019 March 31, 2018 April 1, 2017 Net cash provided by (used in) Operating activities $ 65,228 $ 31,623 $ 33,459 Investing activities (2,030 ) (8,621 ) (18,737 ) Financing activities (72,518 ) 10,336 3,694 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (662 ) 586 (586 ) Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents (9,982 ) 33,924 17,830 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at beginning of period 136,616 102,692 84,862 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at end of period $ 126,634 $ 136,616 $ 102,692 The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, existing cash balances and borrowings under available credit facilities. Cash balances and cash flow from operations for the next year are expected to be adequate to fund capital expenditures. The level of cash availability is projected to be in excess of cash needed to operate the business for the next year. In the event operating cash flow is inadequate and one or more capital resources were to become unavailable, the Company would revise operating strategies accordingly. Cash provided by operating activities increased from $31.6 million in fiscal year 2018 to $65.2 million in 2019. The increase was primarily due to an increase in operating income after adding back non-cash related expenses such as equity-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, which increased due to the Exchange with Skyline and overall operating improvement. The increase was partially offset by costs associated with the integration of the Skyline operations of $8.0 million. Cash provided by operating activities was relatively stable at $31.6 million in fiscal year 2018 versus $33.4 million in 2017. Operating income increased by approximately $19.9 million from 2017 to 2018 but was offset by higher cash tax payments, transaction costs associated with the Exchange, and net cash outflows for changes in operating assets and liabilities. Cash used in investing activities was $2.0 million in fiscal year 2019 versus $8.6 million in 2018. The $6.6 million decrease was mainly due to the $9.7 million cash assumed in the Exchange, offset by an increase in capital expenditures of $2.6 million. Cash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2017 was $18.7 million versus $8.6 million in 2018. The decrease in fiscal 2018 was a result of cash used in the IBS Acquisition of $14.3 million in fiscal 2017, offset by an additional $2.5 million of capital expenditures for the purchase of property, plant and equipment and $4.5 million less cash received in fiscal 2018 for the sale of non-operating assets. Cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2019 was mainly related to Champion Holdings members’ capital distribution of $65.2 million, completed in conjunction with the Exchange with Skyline and a paydown on revolving debt of $5.0 million. Cash provided by financing activities was $6.6 million higher in fiscal 2018 than in fiscal 2017, primarily as a result of an increase in net borrowings on floor plan payables of $7.9 million. On June 5, 2018, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of banks. The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility of up to $100.0 million, including a letter of credit sub-facility of not less than $45.0 million. Initial borrowings under the Credit Agreement were used to repay the Company’s existing $46.9 million term loans (“Term Loans”) and replace the Company’s existing cash collateralized stand-alone letter of credit facility. The interest rate on the Credit Agreement is based on LIBOR and was 4.1% at March 30, 2019. The Company had $37.1 million available to borrow against the Credit Agreement at March 30, 2019. 39 Table of Contents C ONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS The following table presents a summary of payments due by period for the Company’s contractual obligations for long-term debt and operating leases as of March 30, 2019: Payments due by period: After March 30, 2019 (1) (2) (Dollars in thousands) Total <1 Year 1 to 3 Years 3 to 5 Years >5 Years Revolving credit facility maturing in 2023 $ 41,900 $ — $ — $ 41,900 $ — Obligations under industrial revenue bonds due 2029 12,430 — — — 12,430 Operating leases 18,455 5,302 6,842 3,313 2,998 Total $ 72,785 $ 5,302 $ 6,842 $ 45,213 $ 15,428 (1) The variable interest on outstanding debt obligations is not included in the repayment information. (2) Based on the outstanding debt obligations and variable rates in effect at March 30, 2019, the estimated annual interest expense on the revolving credit facility and industrial revenue bonds would be $2.1 million. Credit Facility The Credit Agreement matures on June 5, 2023 and has no scheduled amortization. The interest rate under the Credit Agreement will adjust based on the first lien net leverage of the Company which will range from a high of LIBOR plus 2.25% and ABR plus 1.25% when first lien net leverage is equal to or greater than 2.00:1.00, to a low of LIBOR plus 1.50% and ABR plus 0.50% when first lien net leverage is below 0.50:1.00. In addition, the Company is obligated to pay a commitment fee ranging between 0.40% and 0.25% (depending on first lien net leverage) in respect of unused commitments under the Credit Agreement. Letter of Credit Facility The Company has a letter of credit sub-facility under the Credit Agreement. At March 30, 2019, letters of credit issued under the sub-facility totaled $21.0 million. Industrial Revenue Bonds Obligations under industrial revenue bonds are supported by letters of credit and bear interest based on a municipal bond index rate. The industrial revenue bonds require lump-sum payments of principal upon maturity in 2029. Floor Plan Payable At March 30, 2019, the Company had outstanding borrowings on floor plan financing arrangements of $33.3 million. The Company’s retail operations utilize floor plan financing to fund the acquisition of manufactured homes for display or resale. The arrangements provide for borrowings up to $47.0 million. Borrowings are secured by the homes acquired and are required to be repaid when the Company sells the financed home to a customer. Contingent Obligations The Company has contingent liabilities and obligations at March 30, 2019, including surety bonds and letters of credit totaling $23.6 million and $21.0 million, respectively. Additionally, the Company is contingently obligated under repurchase agreements with certain lending institutions that provide floor plan financing to independent retailers. The contingent repurchase obligation as of March 30, 2019, is approximately $173.4 million, without reduction for the resale value of the homes. See “ Critical Accounting Polices – Reserve for Repurchase Commitments ” below. The Company has provided various representations, warranties and other standard indemnifications in the ordinary course of its business in agreements to acquire and sell business assets and in financing arrangements. The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of its business. 40 Table of Contents In the normal course of business, the Company’s subsidiaries historically provided certain parent company guarantees to two U.K. customers. These guarantees prov ide d contractual liability for proven construction defects up to 12 years from the date of delivery of the units. The guarantees remain a contingent liability subsequent to the disposition of the U.K. operations, which declines over time through October 20 27. As of the date of this report, no claims have been reported under the terms of the guarantees. The Company has guaranteed a portion of its customers’ floor plan obligations beyond the customary repurchase arrangements discussed previously. The Company has agreed to guarantee from 3% to 50% of certain retailers’ outstanding loans with financing companies (“Floor Plan Lenders”). At March 30, 2019, those guarantees total $0.8 million, of which, $0.8 million is outstanding. These obligations are not included in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet and are collateralized by the related homes. Management believes the ultimate liability with respect to these contingent obligations will not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. NON GAAP MEASURES - ADJUSTED EBITDA The Company defines Adjusted Earnings Before Interest Taxes and Depreciation and Amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA ”) as net income or loss plus (a) the provision for income taxes, (b) interest expense, net, (c) depreciation and amortization, (d) gain or loss from discontinued operations, (e) foreign currency gains and losses, (f) equity based compensation awards granted prior to December 31, 2018, (g) non-cash restructuring charges and impairment of assets, and (h) other non-operating costs including those for the acquisition and integration or disposition of businesses and idle facilities. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of earnings calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income or loss prepared on a U.S. GAAP basis. Adjusted EBITDA does not purport to represent cash flow provided by, or used in, operating activities as defined by U.S. GAAP, which is presented in the Statement of Cash Flows. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is presented as a supplemental measure of the Company’s financial performance that management believes is useful to investors, because the excluded items may vary significantly in timing or amounts and/or may obscure trends useful in evaluating and comparing the Company’s operating activities across reporting periods. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA is useful to an investor in evaluating operating performance for the following reasons: Adjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors to measure a company’s operating performance without regard to items such as interest income and expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization and equity-based compensation, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and the book value of assets, capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired; and analysts and investors use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to evaluate the overall operating performance of companies in the industry. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA for planning purposes, including the preparation of internal annual operating budget and periodic forecasts; in communications with the board of directors and investors concerning financial performance; as a factor in determining bonuses under management’s annual incentive compensation program; and as a measure of operating performance used to determine the ability to provide cash flows to support investments in capital assets, acquisitions and working capital requirements for operating expansion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Assumptions and estimates of future earnings and cash flow are used in the periodic analyses of the recoverability of goodwill, intangible assets, deferred tax assets and property, plant and equipment. Historical experience and trends are used to estimate reserves, including reserves for self-insured risks, warranty costs and wholesale repurchase losses. The Company believes that the following discussion addresses the Company’s most critical accounting policies. Acquisitions We allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the assets and liabilities, if any, is recorded as goodwill. We use all available information to estimate fair values. We typically engage outside appraisal firms to assist in the fair value determination of identifiable intangible assets and any other significant assets or liabilities. We adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation, as necessary, up to one year after the acquisition closing date as we obtain more information regarding asset valuations and liabilities assumed. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but that are inherently uncertain, and therefore, may not be realized. Unanticipated events or circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy of our fair value estimates, including assumptions regarding industry economic factors and business strategies. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the estimates, assumptions, and values reflected in the valuations will be realized, and actual results could vary materially. 41 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition For manufacturing shipments to independent retailers and builders/developers, sales revenue is generally recognized when wholesale floor plan financing or retailer credit approval has been received, the home is shipped, and title is transferred. As is customary in the factory-built housing industry, a significant portion of the Company’s manufacturing sales to independent retailers were financed with Floor Plan Lenders. Payment for floor plan sales is generally received 5 to 10 business days from the date of invoice. For retail sales to consumers from the Company’s retail sales centers, sales revenue is recognized when the home has been delivered, set and accepted by the consumer; title has transferred; and either funds have been received from the finance company or directly from the home buyer, depending on the nature of the transaction. The Company recognizes revenue and related cost of sales for long-term construction contracts under the percentage-of-completion method. Management estimates the stage of completion on each construction project based on contract milestones and costs incurred. Billed and unbilled revenue on long-term construction contracts is included in trade accounts receivable. Sales revenue is reported net of applicable sales tax. Reserves for Self-Insured Risks The Company is self-insured for a significant portion of its general insurance, product liability, workers’ compensation, auto, health and property insurance. Insurance coverage is maintained for catastrophic exposures and those risks required to be insured by law. The Company is liable for the first $150,000 of incurred losses for each workers’ compensation and auto liability claim and is responsible for losses up to the first $500,000 per occurrence for general, product liability, and property insurance. Generally catastrophic losses are insured up to $100 million. The health plan is subject to a stop-loss limit of $300,000 per occurrence. Estimated self-insurance costs are accrued for all expected future expenditures for reported and unreported claims based on historical experience. Warranty Reserves The Company’s factory-built housing operations generally provide each retail homebuyer or builder/developer with a 12 or 15-month warranty from the date of retail purchase. Estimated warranty costs are accrued as cost of sales at the time of sale. Warranty provisions and reserves are based on estimates of the amounts necessary to settle existing and future claims on homes sold as of the balance sheet date. Factors used to calculate the warranty obligation include the estimated number of homes still under warranty and the amount and timing of historical costs incurred to service homes. The Company has recorded a liability for estimated future warranty costs relating to homes sold, based upon assessment of historical experience factors. Factors used in the estimation of the warranty liability include the estimated amount of homes still under warranty including homes in retailer inventories, homes purchased by consumers still within the warranty period, the timing in which work orders were completed and the historical average costs incurred to service a home. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets It is the Company’s policy to evaluate the recoverability of property, plant and equipment whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable, primarily based on estimated selling price, appraised value or projected undiscounted future cash flows. Impairment of Goodwill Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment on at least an annual basis. Impairment testing is required more often than annually if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment is more likely than not to have occurred. In conducting its annual impairment testing, the Company may first perform a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount. If not, no further goodwill impairment testing is required. If it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount, or if the Company elects not to perform a qualitative assessment of a reporting unit, the Company then compares the fair value of the reporting unit to the related net book value. If the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is measured and recognized. As the analysis depends upon judgments, estimates and assumptions, such testing is subject to inherent uncertainties, which could cause the fair value to fluctuate from period to period. 42 Table of Contents In fiscal 2019, the Company performed a qualitative assessment of its reporting units. The assessment was completed as of the first day of March. The assessment indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded its respective carrying value. The Company does not believe that any reporting units are at risk for impairment. Income Taxes and Deferred Tax Assets Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided when the Company determines that it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Reserve for Repurchase Commitments As is customary in the factory-built housing industry, a significant portion of the manufacturing operations’ sales to independent retailers are made pursuant to repurchase agreements with lending institutions that provide wholesale floor plan financing to the retailers. Certain homes sold pursuant to repurchase agreements are subject to repurchase, generally up to 24 months after the sale of the home to the retailer. Certain other homes sold pursuant to repurchase agreements are subject to repurchase until the home is sold by the retailer. For those homes with an unlimited repurchase period, the Company’s risk of loss upon repurchase declines due to required monthly principal payments by the retailer. After 24 or 30 months from the date of the Company’s sale of the home, the risk of loss on these homes is low, and by the 46th month, most programs require that the home be paid in full, at which time the Company no longer has risk of loss. Pursuant to these agreements, during the repurchase period, generally upon default by the retailer and repossession by the financial institution, the Company is obligated to repurchase the homes from the Floor Plan Lender. The contingent repurchase obligation as of March 30, 2019, is estimated to be approximately $173.4 million, without reduction for the resale value of the homes. Losses under repurchase obligations represent the difference between the repurchase price and net proceeds from the resale of the homes, less accrued rebates, which will not be paid. Losses incurred on homes repurchased have been insignificant in recent periods. The reserve for estimated losses under repurchase agreements is $1.0 million at March 30, 2019. Retailer Volume Rebates The Company’s factory-built housing operations sponsor volume-based rebate programs under which sales to retailers and builders/developers can qualify for cash rebates. Rebates are generally based on the level of sales attained during a 12-month period and are accrued at the time of sale. Rebates are included as a reduction of net sales in the consolidated statements of operations. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Off balance sheet arrangements at March 30, 2019, consist of the contingent repurchase obligation totaling approximately $173.4 million, letters of credit totaling $21.0 million, and surety bonds totaling $23.6 million. See “Contractual Obligations and Commitments – Contingent Obligations” and “Critical Accounting Policies – Reserve for Repurchase Commitments” above for more information related to off balance sheet arrangements. OTHER MATTERS Inflation Inflation has not had a material effect on profitability during the past three years. Commodity prices, including lumber, have fluctuated in recent years, but increases have generally been passed on to customers or mitigated through working with supply chain partners. However, sudden increases in specific costs, as well as price competition, can affect the ability to pass on costs and adversely impact results of operations. Therefore, there is no assurance that inflation or the impact of rising material costs will not have a significant impact on revenue or results of operations in the future. Seasonality The housing industry is affected by seasonality, which includes factory-built homes. Sales during the period from March to November are traditionally higher than other months. As a result, quarterly results of a particular period are not necessarily representative of the results expected for the year. Recently Issued Accounting Standards Refer to Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” in our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding new accounting pronouncements. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITAT IVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Risk Debt obligations under the Credit Agreement are subject to variable rates of interest based on LIBOR, the administrative agent’s prime rate or the U.S. federal funds rate. A 100 basis point increase in the underlying interest rate would result in an additional annual interest expense of approximately $0.4 million, assuming related debt of $41.9 million, which is the amount of outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement at March 30, 2019. Obligations under industrial revenue bonds were subject to variable rates of interest based on a municipal bond index rate. A 100 basis point increase in the underlying interest rates would result in additional annual interest expense of approximately $0.1 million, assuming related debt of $12.4 million, which is the amount of outstanding borrowings on industrial revenue bonds at March 30, 2019. Obligations under floor plan financing arrangements were subject to variable rates of interest based on terms negotiated with the Floor Plan Lenders. A 100 basis point increase in the underlying interest rates would result in additional annual interest expense of approximately $0.3 million, assuming related floor plan borrowings of $33.3 million, which is the amount of outstanding borrowings on floor plan financing at March 30, 2019. The Company’s approach to interest rate risk is to balance borrowings between fixed rate and variable rate debt as management deems appropriate. At March 30, 2019, the Company’s borrowings under the Credit Agreement, industrial revenue bonds and floor plan financing arrangements are all at variable rates. Foreign Exchange Risk The Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk with its factory-built housing operations in Canada. The Canadian operations had fiscal 2019 net sales of $98.6 million Canadian dollars. Assuming future annual Canadian net sales equal to fiscal 2019, a change of 1.0% in exchange rates between the U.S. and Canadian dollars would change consolidated sales by $1.0 million. The Company also has foreign exchange risk for cash balances maintained in Canadian dollars that are subject to fluctuating values when exchanged into U.S. dollars. The Company does not financially hedge its investment in the Canadian operations or in Canadian denominated bank deposits. ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Financial statements and supplementary data are filed herewith under Item 15. ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company’s management, with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), as of March 30, 2019. This evaluation did not include an assessment of internal controls over financial reporting as it relates to Champion Enterprises Holdings, LLC (“Champion Holdings”) and the subsidiaries of Champion Holdings that were contributed to Skyline Corporation as part of the Exchange with Skyline Corporation that was completed on June 1, 2018 resulting in the formation of Skyline Champion Corporation, as further described under Item 1, Business – General of this Annual Report. Based on that evaluation, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 30, 2019. 44 Table of Contents (b) Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on the Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of March 30, 2019. Because of their inherent limitations, the Company's controls and procedures may not prevent or detect misstatements. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all controls systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. The scope of management’s assessment of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting excluded the operations of Champion Holdings and its subsidiaries. Champion Holdings and its subsidiaries’ total assets and total revenues represent 92% and 84%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the fiscal year ended March 30, 2019. (c) Attestation Report of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The attestation report of the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting is set forth in Item 15, ""Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,"" under the caption ""Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control over Financial Reporting"" and incorporated herein by reference. (d) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting In its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended May 31, 2017, management reported a material weakness in the Company’s design of its control activities over the accuracy and valuation of raw materials inventory. Specifically, the Company did not have sufficient controls in place to compile the raw material inventory listing from the physical inventory counts or over the valuation of raw materials at cost under the first-in, first-out method. During fiscal 2019, the Company completed several changes to its internal control over financial reporting and remediated the previously reported material weakness. The following changes were made to the Company’s internal control over financial reporting: (a) The Company implemented an enterprise resource planning software application to automate and standardize processes, including processes related to the compilation of physical inventory counts and the valuation of raw materials at cost under the first-in, first-out method. (b) The Company enhanced the controls related to the physical inventory counts by increasing the frequency of physical inventory counts and implementing more robust inventory count procedures including increasing the numbers of parts subject to count audits. Other than as described above, there were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended March 30, 2019 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the fiscal years ended March 30, 2019, March 31, 2018, and April 1, 2017, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of March 30, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated May 23, 2019, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2006. Detroit, Michigan May 23, 2019 F-2 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Skyline Champion Corporation Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have audited Skyline Champion Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of March 30, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Skyline Champion Corporation (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 30, 2019, based on the COSO criteria. As indicated in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management’s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Champion Enterprise Holdings, LLC and its subsidiaries, which is included in the March 30, 2019 consolidated financial statements of the Company and constituted 92% of total assets as of March 30, 2019 and 84% of total revenues for the fiscal year then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Champion Enterprise Holdings, LLC and its subsidiaries. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of Skyline Champion Corporation as of March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive (loss) income, equity and cash flows for each of the fiscal years ended March 30, 2019, March 31, 2018, and April 1, 2017, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) and our report dated May 23, 2019, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP Detroit, Michigan May 23, 2019 F-3 Table of Contents Skyline Champion Corporation Consolidated Balance Sheets (Dollars and shares in thousands, except per share amounts) March 30, 2019 March 31, 2018 ASSETS Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 126,634 $ 113,731 Trade accounts receivable, net 57,649 41,984 Inventories 122,638 98,022 Other current assets 11,369 9,367 Total current assets 318,290 263,104 Long-term assets: Property, plant and equipment, net 108,587 67,960 Restricted cash — 22,885 Goodwill 173,406 3,179 Amortizable intangible assets, net 48,936 1,542 Deferred tax assets 34,058 30,290 Other noncurrent assets 16,677 6,438 Total assets $ 699,954 $ 395,398 LIABILITIES AND EQUITY Current liabilities: Floor plan payable $ 33,321 $ 29,825 Short-term portion of debt — 404 Accounts payable 43,421 36,773 Other current liabilities 129,561 100,112 Total current liabilities 206,303 167,114 Long-term liabilities: Long-term debt 54,330 58,927 Deferred tax liabilities 3,422 3,294 Other 23,927 12,766 Total long-term liabilities 81,679 74,987 Equity: Common stock, $0.0277 par value, 115,000 shares authorized, 56,657 shares issued as of March 30, 2019 (including 290 shares subject to restriction) 1,569 — Additional paid-in capital 479,226 — Members’ contributed capital — 140,076 (Accumulated deficit) retained earnings (58,208 ) 22,514 Accumulated other comprehensive loss (10,615 ) (9,293 ) Total equity 411,972 153,297 Total liabilities and equity $ 699,954 $ 395,398 See accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation: On June 1, 2018, Skyline Champion Corporation (formerly known as Skyline Corporation), an Indiana corporation (the “Company”) and Champion Enterprises Holdings, LLC (“Champion Holdings”) completed the transactions contemplated by the Share Contribution & Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”), dated as of January 5, 2018, by and between the Company and Champion Holdings. Under the Exchange Agreement, (i) Champion Holdings contributed to the Company all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of each of Champion Holdings’ wholly-owned operating subsidiaries (the “Contributed Shares”), and (ii) in exchange for the Contributed Shares, the Company issued to the members of Champion Holdings, in the aggregate, 47,752,008 shares of the Company common stock (“Skyline Common Stock”) (such issuance, the “Shares Issuance”). Immediately following the Shares Issuance, the members of Champion Holdings collectively held 84.5%, and the Company’s pre-closing shareholders collectively held 15.5%, of the issued and outstanding Skyline Common Stock on a fully-diluted basis. The contribution of the Contributed Shares by Champion Holdings to Skyline, and the Shares Issuance by the Company to the members of Champion Holdings are collectively referred to herein as the “Exchange.” The Exchange was treated as a purchase of the Company by Champion Holdings for accounting and financial reporting purposes. As a result, the financial results for the twelve months ending March 30, 2019 are comprised of 1) the results of Champion Holdings for the period between April 1, 2018 and May 31, 2018 and 2) the Company, after giving effect to the Exchange, from June 1, 2018 through March 30, 2019. All annual periods presented prior to the effective date of the Exchange are comprised solely of the results of Champion Holdings. All Company earnings per share and common stock outstanding amounts in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been calculated as if the Shares Issuance took place on April 3, 2016, at the exchange ratio, as defined in the Exchange Agreement. Nature of Operations: The Company’s operations consist of manufacturing, retail and transportation activities. At March 30, 2019, the Company operated 31 manufacturing facilities throughout the United States (“U.S.”) and five manufacturing facilities in western Canada that primarily construct factory-built, timber-framed manufactured and modular houses that are sold primarily to independent retailers and builders/developers. The Company’s retail operations consist of 21 sales centers that sell manufactured houses to consumers primarily in the Southern U.S. The Company’s transportation business engages independent owners/drivers to transport recreational vehicles throughout the U.S. and Canada and manufactured houses in certain regions of the U.S. The Company also has holding companies located in the Netherlands. Principles of Consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, its wholly owned subsidiaries, and its majority-owned subsidiaries which it controls. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Variable Interest Entities and Joint Ventures : The Company analyzes its investments in non-wholly owned subsidiaries to determine whether they are unconsolidated joint ventures, consolidated joint ventures, or variable interest entities (“VIEs”) and, if so, whether the Company is the primary beneficiary in accordance with ASC 810 Consolidation . The Company has a 90% equity interest in a consolidated joint venture that was formed in March 2012 to acquire and develop land into a subdivision of modular homes to be sold to homebuyers. The Company is responsible for the development of the subdivision and marketing the lots for sale, and to provide, install and set up modular homes on the lots. The Company recorded an impairment charge of $1.2 million during fiscal 2018 to reflect the net realizable value of development inventory. The net investment in development inventory was zero at both March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018, and had a value of $1.2 million at April 1, 2017. Accounting Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“US. GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto. Estimates made in preparing the accompanying consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, business combinations, reserves for obsolete inventory, accrued warranty costs, useful lives of fixed and intangible assets, asset impairment analyses, insurance reserves, legal reserves, repurchase reserves, share-based compensation and deferred tax valuation allowances. Actual results could differ from those estimates, making it reasonably possible that a change in these estimates could occur within one year. F-9 Table of Contents Fiscal Year: The Compan y’s fiscal year is a 52- or 53-week period that ends on the Saturday nearest March 31. Fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017 include the 52-weeks ended March 30, 2019, March 31, 2018 and April 1, 2017, respectively . Revenue Recognition: Revenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of a contract are satisfied which generally occurs at a point in time through the transfer of control of promised goods to the Company's customers. Control transfers once a customer has the ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the benefits from, the product. This includes the transfer of legal title, physical possession, the risks and rewards of ownership, and customer acceptance. Sales revenue is reported net of applicable sales tax. See Note 11, Revenue Recognition, for additional information. Cost of Sales: Cost of sales includes manufacturing costs such as (i) materials, (ii) compensation and employee benefits for direct and indirect labor, (iii) fixed and variable manufacturing overhead costs, (iv) warranty costs, (v) inbound delivery costs and (vi) depreciation of buildings and equipment. Manufacturing overhead costs include costs such as (i) utilities, (ii) workers’ compensation and product liability self-insurance, (iii) real and personal property taxes on buildings and equipment, (iv) manufacturing supplies, (v) repairs and maintenance and (vi) rents and leases for buildings and equipment. Cost of sales also includes certain post-manufacturing costs, to the extent such costs are the Company’s responsibility. Post-manufacturing costs may include delivery and setup, foundations, craning, roofing, exterior cladding, interior finishing, utility connections and other miscellaneous site costs. Generally, subcontractors are engaged to perform post-manufacturing activities. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses: Selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) include costs such as (i) salaries, wages, incentives and employee benefits for executive, management, sales, engineering, accounting, information technology (“IT”) and administrative employees; (ii) sales commissions; (iii) marketing and advertising costs; (iv) legal and professional fees; (v) depreciation, rents and leases for administrative facilities, office equipment, IT equipment and computer software; and (vi) postage, office supplies, travel and telephone expenses. Advertising Costs and Delivery Costs and Revenue : Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Total advertising expense was approximately $1.5 million in fiscal year 2019 and $1.0 in each of the fiscal years 2018 and 2017. Delivery costs are included in cost of sales and delivery revenue is included in net sales. Foreign Currency: The Company had intercompany loans between its U.S. and foreign subsidiaries for long-term and short-term financing purposes. The foreign exchange impact on these transactions was reported in the consolidated statements of operations under foreign currency transaction gains and losses. The financial statement impact was based on fluctuations in the relative exchange rates between the U.S. dollar, Canadian dollar and British pound. The intercompany loans were repaid during fiscal 2018 per the terms of the Exchange. Translation adjustments of the Company’s international subsidiaries for which the local currency is the functional currency are reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. Fair Value: The Company estimates the fair value of its financial instruments in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measuremen t , which establishes a fair value hierarchy and requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. As such, the fair value of financial instruments is estimated using available market information and other valuation methods. The Company groups assets and liabilities at fair value in three levels, based on the inputs and assumptions used to determine fair value. These levels are: • Level 1—Fair value determined based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. • Level 2—Fair value determined using significant observable inputs, generally either quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities or quoted prices in markets that are not active. • Level 3—Fair value determined using significant observable inputs, such as pricing models, discounted cash flows, or similar techniques. The Company records accounts receivable, accounts payable and other current liabilities at cost. The carrying value of these instruments approximate their fair value due to their short-term maturities. F-10 Table of Contents Cash and Cash Equivalents : Cas h and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments that have original maturities less than 90 days at the time of their purchase. These investments are carried at cost, which approximates market value because of their short maturities. Restricted Cash: Restricted cash primarily represented collateral for letters of credit issued to support industrial revenue bonds, repurchase obligations, self-insurance programs and bonding facilities prior to the Exchange. Trade Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: The Company extends credit terms on a customer-by-customer basis in the normal course of business, as such, trade accounts receivable are subject to customary credit risk. The allowance for doubtful accounts represents the Company's best estimate of probable credit losses in accounts receivable. Receivables are written off against the allowance when management believes that the amount receivable will not be recovered. At March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018, the Company had an allowance for doubtful accounts of $0.6 million and $0.2 million, respectively. Inventories : Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined under the first-in, first-out method. Capitalized manufacturing costs include the cost of materials, labor and manufacturing overhead. Retail inventories of new manufactured homes built by the Company are valued at manufacturing cost, including materials, labor and manufacturing overhead, or net purchase price if acquired from unaffiliated third parties. Inventories also included the Company’s investment in the community development owned by the consolidated joint venture, net of applicable impairments. These costs included land acquisition and development expenditures, as well as interest, real estate taxes and direct overhead costs related to development and construction. These costs were capitalized to inventory during the period beginning with the commencement of development and ending with the completion of construction. The Company discontinued capitalizing costs for the community development during 2018 because it stopped development activities. Property, Plant, and Equipment : Property, plant and equipment (“PP&E”) are stated at acquisition date cost. Depreciation is provided principally on the straight-line method, generally over the following estimated useful lives: land improvements—3 to 10 years; buildings and improvements—8 to 25 years; and vehicles and machinery and equipment—3 to 8 years. Depreciation expense, including amortization of assets under capital lease, was $11.3 million, $7.8 million, and $6.8 million for fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. At March 30, 2019, the Company owned five idle manufacturing facilities and two idle retail sales centers with a net book value of $9.6 million. These properties are accounted for as long-lived assets to be held and used. During fiscal 2017, the Company acquired three idle manufacturing facilities and two idle retail sales centers, with a combined book value of $8.6 million, as part of the acquisition of Innovative Building Systems, LLC and its subsidiaries (“IBS”). During fiscal 2017, the Company sold four previously idled manufacturing facilities for net proceeds of $5.0 million. The Company recognized a net gain on the sale of $0.9 million. It is the Company’s policy to evaluate the recoverability of property, plant and equipment whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable, primarily based on estimated selling price, appraised value or projected undiscounted future cash flows in accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment (“ASC 360”). Assets held for sale: Long-lived assets expected to be sold or otherwise disposed of within one year are classified as assets held for sale and included in other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets. In connection with the Exchange, the Company acquired an office building which was classified as an asset held for sale, valued at $2.1 million. Goodwill : The Company tests goodwill for impairment in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other . Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment on at least an annual basis. Impairment testing is required more often than annually if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment is more likely than not to have occurred. In conducting its annual impairment testing, the Company may first perform a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount. If not, no further goodwill impairment testing is required. If it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount, or if the Company elects not to perform a qualitative assessment of a reporting unit, the Company then compares the fair value of the reporting unit to the related net book value. If the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is measured and recognized. In fiscal 2019, the Company performed a qualitative assessment of its reporting units. The assessment was completed as of the first day of March. The assessment indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded its respective carrying value. The Company does not believe that any reporting units are at risk for impairment. F-11 Table of Contents Business combinations: The Company accounts for its business combinations in accordance with the accounting guidance in ASC 805, Business Combinations. The purchase price of an acquired business is allocated to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the assets and liabilities, if any, is recorded as goodwill. Determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management’s judgment, the utilization of independent appraisal firms and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the timing and amount of future cash flows, market rate assumptions, actuarial assumptions, and appropriate discount rates, among other items. Refer to Note 2, Business Combination and Acquisition, for additional information. Amortizable Intangible Assets : Amortizable intangible assets consist primarily of fair values assigned to customer relationships and trade names. Trade names were valued based upon the royalty-saving method and customer relationships were valued based upon the excess earnings method. Amortization is provided over the useful lives of the intangible assets, generally up to ten years, using the straight-line method. The recoverability of amortizable intangible assets is evaluated whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recovered, in accordance with the recognition and measurement provisions of ASC 360. Warranty Obligations : The Company’s manufactured housing operations generally provides the retail homebuyer or the builder/developer with a warranty from the date of respective purchase. Estimated warranty costs are accrued as cost of sales at the time of sale. Warranty provisions and reserves are based on estimates of the amounts necessary to settle existing and future claims on homes sold by the manufacturing segment as of the balance sheet date. Factors used to calculate the warranty obligation are the estimated number of homes still under warranty and the historical average costs incurred to service a home. Dealer Volume Rebates : The Company’s manufacturing segment sponsors volume rebate programs under which sales to retailers and builder/developers can qualify for cash rebates generally based on the level of sales attained during a twelve-month period. Volume rebates are accrued at the time of sale and are recorded as a reduction of net sales. Repurchase Agreements: The Company is contingently liable under terms of repurchase agreements with lending institutions that provide wholesale floor plan financing to retailers. These arrangements, which are customary in the industry, provide for the repurchase of products sold to retailers in the event of default by the retailer on their agreement to pay the financial institution. The risk of loss from these agreements is spread over numerous retailers. The repurchase price is generally determined by the original sales price of the product and pre-defined curtailment arrangements. The Company accounts for the guarantee under its repurchase agreements with our retailers’ financing institutions by estimating and deferring a portion of the related product sale that represents the estimated fair value of the repurchase obligation. The estimated fair value takes into account the estimate of the loss the Company will incur upon resale of any repurchases. This estimate is based on recent historical experience supplemented by management’s assessment of current economic and other conditions affecting the Company’s retailers. Accrued Self-Insurance : The Company is self-insured for a significant portion of its workers’ compensation, general and product liability, auto liability, health and property insurance. Insurance coverage is maintained for catastrophic exposures and those risks required to be insured by law. Estimated self-insurance costs are accrued for incurred claims and estimated claims incurred but not yet reported. Equity-Based Compensation: Stock-based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is generally recognized as expense ratably on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. Forfeitures are recognized in the period in which they occur. Comprehensive Income and Loss: Components of comprehensive income and loss are changes in equity other than those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners. The aggregate amount of such changes to equity that have not yet been recognized in net income or loss are reported in the equity section of the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss net of tax. As a result of the disposition of operations in the United Kingdom, the Company reclassified $7.6 million of net accumulated other comprehensive income to net income, which is included in discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations during fiscal 2017. There was no tax effect for comprehensive income for fiscal 2019 and 2018. The tax effect for comprehensive income in fiscal 2017 was not material. F-12 Table of Contents Income Taxes : The provision for income taxes is calculated using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent upon the generation of future taxable income. In determining the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns, judgment is required. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements: In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued an amendment on revenue recognition. The amendment created Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, (“ASC 606”) and supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition , including most industry-specific revenue recognition guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification. In addition, the amendment supersedes the cost guidance in Subtopic 605-35, Revenue Recognition - Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts , and created new Subtopic 340-40, Other Assets and Deferred Costs - Contracts with Customers . Under ASC 606 an entity recognizes revenue in a manner that reflects the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. On April 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASC 606 using the modified retrospective method as applied to customer contracts that were not completed as of March 31, 2018. As a result, financial information for reporting periods beginning after March 31, 2018, are presented in accordance with ASC 606 while prior reporting periods were not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with the Company’s revenue recognition policies prior to the adoption of ASC 606. There was no material impact to revenues as a result of applying ASC 606 for the fiscal year ended March 30, 2019 and the post-adoption effects to the Company’s business processes, systems or internal controls were not significant. On April 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2016-18, Restricted Cash . The standard requires that changes in restricted cash be reflected with changes in cash and cash equivalents on the statement of cash flows and that a reconciliation between cash and cash equivalents presented on the balance sheet and cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash presented on the statement of cash flows be provided. The provisions of the standard were applied retrospectively, and the effects of adoption were not significant. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Pending Adoption: In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) , to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. A lessee should recognize in the consolidated balance sheet a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and an asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee have not significantly changed from previous requirements. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2018. Modified retrospective application and early adoption is permitted. The Company will reflect the adoption of ASC 842 as of March 31, 2019, the first day of the Company’s 2020 fiscal year using the modified retrospective approach and will not be restating comparative periods. The Company has elected to apply the transition package of three practical expedients which allow companies not to reassess whether agreements contain leases, the classification of leases, and the capitalization of initial direct costs. The Company has also made accounting policy elections to: 1) recognize lease expense for leases with a term of 12 months or less on a straight-line basis over the lease term and will not recognize any right of use assets or lease liabilities for those leases, and 2) not separate lease and non-lease components. The Company has substantially completed the implementation of new lease accounting software and finalizing updates to its internal controls to address the requirements of the new standard. The primary financial statement impact upon adoption will be the recognition, on a discounted basis, of the Company's minimum commitments under noncancelable operating leases as right of use assets and obligations on the consolidated balance sheets. The adoption of ASC 842 will result in the recognition of lease-related assets and liabilities in a range between $12.0 million and $15.0 million. The standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's results of operations or cash flows. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment . The standard simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairments and allows a goodwill impairment charge to be based on the amount of a reporting unit’s carrying value in excess of its fair value. This eliminates the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill or what is known as “Step 2” under the current guidance. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods of public entities beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements. There were no other accounting standards recently issued that are expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations. F-13 Table of Contents 2. Business Combination and Acquisitions Skyline Corporation Transaction The Exchange between Champion Holdings and Skyline was completed on June 1, 2018 and was accounted for as a reverse acquisition under the acquisition method of accounting as provided by ASC 805. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed as a result of the Exchange were recorded at their respective fair values and added to the carrying value of Champion Holdings’ existing assets and liabilities. The Company incurred acquisition-related costs of approximately $6.9 million and $7.2 million for the fiscal years 2019 and 2018, which were recorded as incurred and have been classified as other expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Additionally, the Company incurred approximately $6.0 million in stock compensation expense related to former Skyline employees during the fiscal year 2019, which is recorded in SG&A in the consolidated statements of operations. The purchase price of the acquisition was determined with reference to the value of equity (common stock) of the Company based on the closing price on June 1, 2018 of $33.39 per share. The purchase price has been allocated on a preliminary basis to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed using their estimated fair values at June 1, 2018, the closing of the Exchange. The purchase price and the preliminary allocation have been used to prepare the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The purchase price allocation is preliminary and could be revised as a result of additional information obtained regarding liabilities assumed and revisions of provisional estimates of certain acquired tax attributes. The preliminary allocation of the purchase price is as follows: (Dollars in thousands) Initially Reported Changes to Purchase Price and Allocation Preliminary Allocation at March 30, 2019 Cash $ 9,722 $ — $ 9,722 Trade accounts receivable 13,876 — 13,876 Inventory 19,028 — 19,028 Assets held for sale 2,086 — 2,086 Property, plant and equipment 42,556 (2,336 ) 40,220 Deferred tax assets, net 9,733 (2,737 ) 6,996 Other assets 6,349 357 6,706 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities (36,319 ) 292 (36,027 ) Intangibles 43,300 8,918 52,218 Goodwill 174,834 (4,607 ) 170,227 Total purchase price allocation $ 285,165 $ (113 ) $ 285,052 Preliminary estimated goodwill is primarily attributable to expected synergies from the combination of the companies, including, but not limited to, expected cost synergies through procurement activities and operational improvements through sharing of best practices. Goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes. Cash, trade receivables, other assets, accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities were generally stated at historical carrying values given the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities. Intangible assets consist primarily of amounts recognized for the fair value of customer relationships and trade names and were based on an independent appraisal. Customer-based assets include the Company’s established relationships with its customers and the ability of those customers to generate future economic profits for the Company. The Company estimates that these intangible assets have a weighted average useful life of ten years. Fair value estimates of PP&E were based on independent appraisals and broker opinions of value, giving consideration to the highest and best use of the assets. Key assumptions used in the appraisals were based on a combination of market and cost approaches, as appropriate. Level 3 fair value estimates of $40.2 million related to property, plant and equipment and $52.2 million related to intangible assets were recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of March 30, 2019. The Company determined $2.1 million of property acquired met the definition of held for sale and is classified in other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at March 30, 2019. For further information on acquired assets measured at fair value, see Note 7, Goodwill and Intangible Assets. The Company allocated a portion of the purchase price to certain realizable deferred tax assets totaling $27.3 million, on a preliminary basis. Deferred tax assets are primarily federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and credits offset by a valuation allowance for certain state net operating loss carryforwards that are not expected to be realized. The deferred tax assets are offset by deferred tax liabilities of $20.3 million resulting from the purchase price allocation step-up in fair value that exceed the historical tax basis. F-14 Table of Contents The statement of operations for fiscal 2019 includes $218.8 million of net sales a ttributable to the acquired Skyline operations . A summary of the results of operations for the Company, on an as reported and on a pro forma basis, are as follows: Year Ended March 30, 2019 Year Ended March 31, 2018 (Dollars in thousands) Reported Pro forma Reported Pro forma Net sales $ 1,360,043 $ 1,405,847 $ 1,064,722 $ 1,297,159 Net (loss) income (58,208 ) (43,460) 15,800 25,655 The pro forma results are based on adding the historical results of operations of Champion and Skyline and adjusting those historical amounts for the amortization of intangibles created in the Exchange; the increase in depreciation as a result of the step-up in fair value of property, plant and equipment; removing transaction costs directly associated with the Exchange; removing equity-based compensation expense directly resulting from the Exchange; reflecting the financing arrangements entered into in connection with the Exchange, and adjusting those items for income taxes. The pro forma disclosures do not give effect to the potential impact of current financial conditions, any anticipated synergies, operating efficiencies or cost savings that may result from the Exchange or any integration costs. The pro forma data is intended for informational purposes and is not indicative of the future results of operations. The Exchange Agreement provided that the Company was permitted to pay a capital distribution prior to completion of the Exchange to the extent it had cash in excess of debt and other debt-like items and unpaid Exchange fees and expenses. Prior to the completion of the Exchange, the Company made a capital distribution to its members equal to an aggregate of $65.3 million (of which $22.5 million was reflected as a reduction to retained earnings and $42.8 million was reflected as a reduction to members’ contributed capital). Acquisitions On April 11, 2017, the Company completed the purchase of a manufactured housing plant in Mansfield, Texas, from Skyline for cash consideration of $2.2 million. The purchase included the land, building and equipment previously used by Skyline to build manufactured homes. The purchase enabled the Company to expand its manufacturing capacity in Texas. The purchase was accounted for as an asset acquisition. On September 29, 2016, the Company, through a series of transactions, completed the purchase of the assets of IBS for cash consideration of $14.3 million. IBS operated five modular manufacturing facilities and two retail sales centers in the Northeast and Midwest. Prior to the acquisition, IBS filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection with the United States Bankruptcy Court (“Bankruptcy Court”) and ceased operations. As a result, the purchase of the business was facilitated by a Sec. 363 sale with the Bankruptcy Court. Significant acquired assets included inventory of $1.5 million, land and four manufacturing facilities of $10.2 million, machinery and equipment of $1.5 million and tradename intangibles of $0.7 million. The Company also assumed the lease of a fifth manufacturing facility. There were no additional liabilities assumed in the transaction. The Company recognized goodwill of $0.1 million related to this acquisition. During January 2017, the Company began operations at one of the acquired facilities. The Company incurred $1.7 million of fees and expenses related to the purchase of IBS, including legal, advisory and environmental inspection fees, inclusive of a $0.7 million loss on the acquisition of debt acquired from the IBS secured creditors that was settled by proceeds from the bankruptcy sale. Those expenses are included in other expense in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. On April 4, 2016, the Company purchased substantially all of the assets and business of Skyco, LLC, for cash consideration of $0.3 million. On July 28, 2016, the Company purchased substantially all of the assets and business of MLK of Panama City, Inc., for cash consideration of $0.1 million. Combined, the acquired entities operated three retail sales centers in Florida and Louisiana, allowing the Company to further expand its retail presence in those markets. The purchases included $2.1 million of new manufactured homes, $1.9 million of assumed floor plan payables and $0.2 million of other net liabilities. The Company recognized goodwill of $0.4 million from these acquisitions. The results of operations of the acquired entities are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition. F-15 Table of Contents 3. Discontinued Operations On January 20, 2017, the Company completed the disposition of Champion U.K., which had been initiated during fiscal 2016. Champion U.K. consisted of five manufacturing facilities that primarily constructed steel-framed modular buildings for military accommodations, hotels, residential accommodations and health and educational units, among other applications. Following is a reconciliation of the components constituting pretax income of discontinued operations to the after-tax income of discontinued operations as presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal year ended April 1, 2017 (dollars in thousands): Major line items constituting pretax income of discontinued operations: Revenue $ 21,137 Cost of sales (18,306 ) Selling, general and administrative expenses (5,016 ) Reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income 7,562 Other 10 Pretax income of discontinued operations 5,387 Pretax loss on sale of U.K. operations (4,803 ) Total pretax gain of U.K. operations 584 Income tax expense (1 ) Gain on discontinued operations, net of tax $ 583 The gain on discontinued operations recognized in fiscal 2017 was primarily the result of the net effect of the reclassification of cumulative translation adjustment gains and defined benefit pension plan losses of $7.6 million from accumulated other comprehensive loss. The translation gains were only recognizable in net income when the transaction to dispose of Champion U.K. was complete. The disposition of Champion U.K. included all asset and liabilities of the disposed entities, including the defined benefit pension plan. As a result, the accumulated pension actuarial loss, previously included in accumulated other comprehensive income, was recognized as a component of discontinued operations. 4 . Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash A reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash was as follows: (Dollars in thousands) March 30, 2019 March 31, 2018 April 1, 2017 Balance sheet - cash and cash equivalents $ 126,634 $ 113,731 $ 81,012 Balance sheet - restricted cash — 22,885 21,680 Statement of cash flows - cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 126,634 $ 136,616 $ 102,692 5 . Inventories The components of net inventory were as follows: (Dollars in thousands) March 30, 2019 March 31, 2018 Raw materials $ 48,531 $ 37,852 Work in process 13,973 10,004 Finished goods and other 60,134 50,166 Total inventories $ 122,638 $ 98,022 At March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018, reserves for obsolete inventory were $4.1 million and $3.5 million, respectively. F-16 Table of Contents 6 . Property, Plant, and Equipment PP&E are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated primarily on the straight-line method, generally over the following estimated useful lives: land improvements – 3 to 10 years; buildings and improvements – 8 to 25 years; and vehicles and machinery and equipment – 3 to 8 years. Depreciation expense, including amortization of assets under capital lease, for the fiscal years ended March 30, 2019, March 31, 2018, and April 1, 2017 was $11.3 million, $7.8 million, and $6.8 million, respectively. The components of PP&E were as follows: (Dollars in thousands) March 30, 2019 March 31, 2018 Land and improvements $ 34,264 $ 22,071 Buildings and improvements 83,973 58,179 Machinery and equipment 42,476 31,924 Construction in progress 3,619 919 Property, plant and equipment, at cost 164,332 113,093 Less accumulated depreciation 55,745 45,133 Property, plant, and equipment, net $ 108,587 $ 67,960 7. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. At March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018, the Company had goodwill of $173.4 million and $3.2 million, respectively. The increase during the fiscal year ended March 30, 2019 was a result of the preliminary estimate of goodwill recognized in the Exchange. Goodwill is allocated to reporting units included in the U.S. Factory-Built Housing segment, which include the Company’s U.S. manufacturing and retail operations. Intangible Assets The components of amortizable intangible assets were as follows: (Dollars in thousands) March 30, 2019 March 31, 2018 Customer Relationships Trade Names Total Customer Relationships Trade Names Total Gross carrying amount $ 48,782 $ 13,173 $ 61,955 $ 5,739 $ 4,268 $ 10,007 Accumulated amortization (9,052 ) (3,967 ) (13,019 ) (5,610 ) (2,855 ) (8,465 ) Amortizable intangibles, net $ 39,730 $ 9,206 $ 48,936 $ 129 $ 1,413 $ 1,542 Weighted average remaining amortization period, in years 8.2 7.1 8.0 4.3 5.5 5.4 During the fiscal year ended March 30, 2019, the Company recognized finite-lived intangibles for customer relationships of $43.2 million and trade names of $9.0 million on a preliminary basis as a result of the allocation of the purchase price from the Exchange. The fair value of the customer relationship intangible asset was estimated using the multi-period excess earnings method of the income approach. The fair value of the customer relationship intangible asset was determined based on estimates and assumptions of projected cash flows attributable to the acquired customer relationships, the annual attrition rate of existing customer relationships, the contributory asset charges attributable to the assets that support the customer relationships, such as net working capital, property, plant and equipment, trade name, and workforce, the economic life and the discount rate as determined at the time of the final valuation. The fair value of the trade name intangible asset was estimated using the relief-from-royalty method of the income approach. The fair value of the trade names intangible asset was determined based on estimates and assumptions of the expected life of the intangible asset, the royalty rate and the discount rate that reflects the level of risk associated with the future cash flows as determined at the time of the final valuation. F-17 Table of Contents Amortization of intangible assets for the fiscal years ended March 30, 2019, March 31, 2018, and April 1, 2017 was $4.8 million, $0.5 million, and $0.4 million respectively. Estimated amortization expense of intangible assets over the next five years is estimated to be (dollars in thousands): Fiscal 2020 $ 5,458 Fiscal 2021 5,458 Fiscal 2022 5,458 Fiscal 2023 5,341 Fiscal 2024 5,293 8 . Other Current Liabilities The components of other current liabilities were as follows: (Dollars in thousands) March 30, 2019 March 31, 2018 Customer deposits and receipts in excess of revenues $ 28,392 $ 24,557 Accrued volume rebates 21,020 17,037 Accrued warranty obligations 17,886 12,530 Accrued compensation and payroll taxes 32,075 24,100 Accrued insurance 16,245 11,112 Other 13,943 10,776 Total other current liabilities $ 129,561 $ 100,112 9 . Accrued Warranty Obligations Changes in the accrued warranty obligations were as follows: Year Ended (Dollars in thousands) March 30, 2019 March 31, 2018 Balance at the beginning of the period $ 15,430 $ 14,534 Warranty assumed in the Exchange 6,259 — Warranty expense 37,298 23,855 Cash warranty payments (35,641 ) (22,959 ) Balance at end of period 23,346 15,430 Less noncurrent portion in other long-term liabilities (5,460 ) (2,900 ) Total current portion $ 17,886 $ 12,530 10 . Debt and Floor Plan Payable Long-term debt consisted of the following: (Dollars in thousands) March 30, 2019 March 31, 2018 Revolving credit facility maturing in 2023 $ 41,900 $ — Obligations under industrial revenue bonds due 2029 12,430 12,430 Other debt — 4 Term Loans due March 2020 — 46,897 Total debt 54,330 59,331 Less current portion — 404 Total long-term debt $ 54,330 $ 58,927 F-18 Table of Contents On June 5, 2018, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of banks. The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility of up to $100.0 million , including a letter of credit sub-facility of not less than $45.0 million. Initial borrowings under the Credit Agreement were used to repay the Company’s existing $46.9 million term loans (“Term Loans”) and replace the Company’s existing cash collateraliz ed stand-alone letter of credit facility. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company repaid $5 .0 million of the outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility. The Credit Agreement matures on June 5, 2023 and has no scheduled amortization. The interest rate under the Credit Agreement adjusts based on the first lien net leverage of the Company. From June 5, 2018 through December 31, 2018, the annual interest rate was the selected London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus 1.75%. Thereafter, the interest rate adjusts based on the first lien net leverage from a high of LIBOR plus 2.25% and ABR plus 1.25% when the first lien net leverage is equal to or greater than 2.00:1.00, to a low of LIBOR plus 1.50% and ABR plus 0.50% when the first lien net leverage is below 0.50:1.00. In addition, the Company is obligated to pay an unused line fee ranging between 0.40% and 0.25% (depending on the first lien net leverage) in respect of unused commitments under the Credit Agreement. At March 30, 2019 the interest rate on borrowings under the Credit Agreement was 3.98%. At March 30, 2019, letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement totaled $21.0 million. Total available borrowings under the Credit Agreement as of March 30, 2019 were $37.1 million. Prior to entering into the Credit Agreement, the Company had outstanding Term Loans of $46.9 million under a prior credit agreement with lenders that primarily included the Company’s equity holders and certain other affiliates. The interest rate on the Term Loans, priced using LIBOR plus an applicable margin, was 7.17% at March 31, 2018. Also, prior to entering into the Credit Agreement, the Company provided letters of credit issued by a commercial bank under a separate stand-alone facility collateralized with restricted cash of 101% of the issued letters of credit. Subsequent to entering into the Credit Agreement, the Company is no longer required to back letters of credit with restricted cash. Obligations under industrial revenue bonds are supported by letters of credit and bear interest based on a municipal bond index rate. The weighted-average interest rate at March 30, 2019, including related costs and fees, was 3.62%. At March 31, 2018, the weighted-average interest rate, including related costs and fees, was 3.15%. The industrial revenue bonds require lump-sum payments of principal upon maturity in 2029. The Credit Agreement contains covenants that restrict the amount of additional debt, liens and certain payments, including equity buybacks, investments, dispositions, mergers and consolidations, among other restrictions as defined. The Company was in compliance with all covenants of the Credit Agreement as of March 30, 2019. Floor Plan Payable The Company’s retail operations utilize floor plan financing to fund the acquisition of manufactured homes for display or resale. At March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018, the Company had outstanding borrowings on floor plan financing agreements of $33.3 million and $29.8 million, respectively. The financing arrangements allow for borrowings up to $47.0 million and $43.0 million, at March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018, respectively. Borrowings are secured by the homes and are required to be repaid when the Company sells the home to a customer. 1 1 . Revenue Recognition The Company’s revenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of a contract are satisfied which generally occurs with the transfer of control of products. The Company enters into contracts with its customers to provide manufactured homes, modular homes, park model RVs, commercial structures and transportation services. Generally, the Company’s contracts may be terminated by the Company’s customers at any time. Historically, terminations of these contracts have been minimal. The Company receives signed sales quotes from its customers, which provide the terms for a specific home, including price. The Company also has agreements with certain customers that provide for certain variable considerations such as volume discounts that are deducted from the contract price and accrued at the time of sale. In certain situations, the Company may receive payment in advance of completion of its contractual obligations. In these situations, the arising contract liability is classified within customer deposits and receipts in excess of revenues. Following the receipt of the customer deposit, the Company typically completes its performance obligation within a twelve-month period. F-19 Table of Contents For sales to indepen dent retailers and builders/developers, revenue is recognized at the point in time when wholesale floor plan financing or retailer credit approval has been received, the home has shipped and title has transferred, which occurs when the Company has satisfie d its contractual obligations and the control of its products has been transferred. The Company does not have an enforceable right to payment prior to shipment. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration that the Company expects to be enti tled to in exchange for those products. The Company’s customers pay for products received in accordance with payment terms that are customary within the industry. As is customary in the factory-built housing industry, a significant portion of the Company’s sales to independent retailers are financed under floor plan financing programs with certain third-party lenders. Floor plan financing arrangements are generally identified prior to shipment of products and payment for sales financed under floor plan prog rams is generally received 5 to 10 business days from the date of invoice. For retail sales to consumers from Company-owned retail sales centers, revenue is recognized when the home has been delivered, set up and accepted by the consumer, title has transferred and, depending on the nature of the transaction, either funds have been received from the finance company or directly from the home buyer. The Company recognizes commercial revenue and related cost of sales for long-term construction contracts (“Commercial”) over time as performance obligations are satisfied using the percentage-of-completion method (input method). Management estimates the stage of completion on each construction project based on progress and costs incurred. Unbilled revenue on long-term construction contracts are classified as a contract asset in accounts receivable. Receipts in excess of billings are classified as contract liabilities and included in other current liabilities. At March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018, uncollected billings related to long-term construction contracts totaled $0.9 million and $5.0 million, respectively. At March 30, 2019, there was no unbilled revenue for long-term contracts. At March 31, 2018, unbilled revenue for long-term construction contracts was $0.3 million. Revenue for the Company’s transportation operations is recognized when a shipment has been delivered to its final destination. Amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling costs are included in net sales. Shipping and handling costs are accounted for as fulfillment costs and are included in cost of sales. The following tables disaggregate the Company’s revenue by sales category: Year Ended March 30, 2019 (Dollars in thousands) U.S. Factory-Built Housing Canadian Factory-built Housing Corporate/ Other Total Manufacturing and retail $ 1,166,245 $ 98,567 $ — $ 1,264,812 Commercial 11,442 — — 11,442 Transportation — — 83,789 83,789 Total $ 1,177,687 $ 98,567 $ 83,789 $ 1,360,043 Year Ended March 31, 2018 (Dollars in thousands) U.S. Factory-Built Housing Canadian Factory-built Housing Corporate/ Other Total Manufacturing and retail $ 841,354 $ 96,603 $ — $ 937,957 Commercial 19,134 — — 19,134 Transportation — — 107,631 107,631 Total $ 860,488 $ 96,603 $ 107,631 $ 1,064,722 Year Ended April 1, 2017 (Dollars in thousands) U.S. Factory-Built Housing Canadian Factory-built Housing Corporate/ Other Total Manufacturing and retail $ 660,984 $ 92,631 $ — $ 753,615 Commercial 17,312 — — 17,312 Transportation — — 90,392 90,392 Total $ 678,296 $ 92,631 $ 90,392 $ 861,319 F-20 Table of Contents 1 2 .

The Tax Act made several changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, with the following changes being most impactful: (1) decreased the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%; (2) implemented a territorial tax system; (3) eliminated the Section 199 Domestic Production Activities Deduction; (4) expanded the scope of executive compensation that is subject to Section 162(m) deduction limitations and (5) allowed for immediate expensing of certain qualified property placed in service after September 27, 2017. The Tax Act subjects a U.S. shareholder to current tax on GILTI earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. The FASB Staff Q&A, Topic 740 No. 5, Accounting for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income , states that an entity can make an accounting election to either recognize deferred taxes for temporary differences expected to reverse as GILTI in future years or provide for the tax expense related to GILTI in the year the tax is incurred. The Company has elected to recognize the tax on GILTI as a period expense in the period the tax is incurred. In conjunction with the signing of the Tax Act on December 22, 2017, Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (“SAB 118”) was issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations when a company does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act. SAB 118 provides a measurement period, that should not extend beyond one year from the Tax Act enactment date, for companies to complete the accounting under ASC 740, Income Taxes . To the extent that a company’s accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act is incomplete but it can determine a reasonable estimate, it must record a provisional estimate in the financial statements. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, the Company recorded a provisional amount of U.S. federal income tax expense of $9.4 million related to the re-measurement of U.S. deferred income tax assets and liabilities at the new corporate income tax rate of 21% and $0.2 million of income tax benefit related to other effects. These amounts are included in income tax expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018. The Company continued its analysis of the Tax Act through the third quarter of fiscal 2019 which resulted in no material change to the provisional amounts recorded in fiscal 2018 related to the re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities. As of December 29, 2018, the Company completed its analysis of the impact of the Tax Act and the amounts are no longer considered provisional. F-22 Table of Contents The current U.S. income tax rate for fiscal 2019 is 21%. The current U.S. income tax rate for fiscal 2018 is a blend ed rate of 31.5%. This rate is calculated under the guidance of Internal Revenue Service Notice 2018-38 by prorating the total annual taxable income by the amount of days in the fiscal year that the enacted 35% was applicable (April 2, 2017 to December 31, 2017) and the amount of days in the fiscal year that the enacted 21% was applicable (January 1, 2018 to March 31, 2018). The current U.S. income tax rate for fiscal 2017 is the pre-Tax Act rate of 35%. Deferred tax assets and liabilities at March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018 consisted of the following: (Dollars in thousands) March 30, 2019 March 31, 2018 ASSETS U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards $ 14,213 $ — Intangible assets 11,110 12,032 Employee compensation 6,326 3,781 Warranty reserves 5,792 3,887 Foreign tax basis difference in investments 4,601 5,608 Self-insurance reserves 4,491 3,223 State net operating loss carryforwards 4,239 344 Inventory reserves and impairments 3,793 3,549 U.S. tax credit carryforwards 2,131 — Dealer volume discounts 1,409 1,551 Stock Compensation 929 — Capitalized transaction costs 534 1,935 Foreign net operating loss carryforwards 499 592 Foreign capital loss carryforwards 186 — Foreign currency translation adjustments 9 — Property, plant and equipment — 616 Other 648 735 Gross deferred tax assets $ 60,910 $ 37,853 LIABILITIES Intangible assets $ 11,997 $ 237 Property, plant and equipment 7,265 389 Foreign tax basis difference in investments 3,422 3,294 Other 297 584 Gross deferred tax liabilities $ 22,981 $ 4,504 Valuation allowance (7,293 ) (6,353 ) Net deferred tax assets $ 30,636 $ 26,996 Due to the ability to repatriate earnings from the foreign subsidiaries tax-free because of the Tax Act, the Company anticipates periodically repatriating the earnings of its Netherlands and Canadian subsidiaries. Prior to the enactment of the Tax Act, the Company’s policy was that all undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries were permanently reinvested except for its U.K. subsidiaries. A deferred tax liability is recognized for income tax withholding which may be incurred upon the reversal of basis differences in investments in its foreign subsidiaries. F-23 Table of Contents The Company e valuates the realizability of its deferred tax assets annually. Concluding that a valuation allowance is not required is difficult when there is significant negative evidence, such as cumulative losses in recent years, which is objective and verifiable. Wh en measuring cumulative losses in recent years, the Company fi r st considers a three-year period of pretax book income. In fiscal 2017, the Company released the valuation allowance of $35.9 million that had been provided with respect to net deferred tax assets in the U.S. Due to the Exchange on June 1, 2018, the Company has U.S. federal and state net operating loss (“ N OL ”) carryforwards that were generated by the pre-Exchange Skyline entities . The Company determined that a valuation allowance of $1.9 million was necessary on the deferred tax asset for certain state NOL carryforwards, which was recorded through the opening balance sheet and did not impact income tax expense. At March 30, 2019, the Company reassessed the valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset for the Skyline state NOL carryforwards and continued to provide a $1.8 million valuation allowance. The $0.1 million change in valuation allowance from the opening balance sheet to f iscal year end was recognized through income tax benefit. The Company maintains a valuation allowance with respect to its deferred tax assets in the Netherlands for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017. The value of the deferred tax assets and related valuation allo wance in the Netherlands was reduced to reflect the Netherlands statutory tax rate decrease from 25% to 20.5% in 2021. As of March 30, 2019, the Company has U.S. federal NOL carryforwards of $67.7 million, which expire in 2031 through 2035. The Company also has state NOL carryforwards in various jurisdictions which expire primarily in 2019 through 2039. As discussed in Note 3, during fiscal 2016 the Company committed to a plan to dispose of its U.K. operations. On January 20, 2017, the Company completed the sale of its operations in the U.K. through a stock sale. The Company did not recognize a tax benefit or tax expense as a result of the sale. As of March 30, 2019, the Company continued to maintain a deferred tax asset for its investment in the U.K. holding company which was subject to a full valuation allowance due to anticipated unrealizability in the U.K.’s parent company’s tax jurisdiction. Unrecognized tax benefits represent the differences between tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return and the benefits recognized for financial statement purposes. The Company’s total unrecognized tax benefits were $0.6 million and $1.2 million at March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018, respectively, which if recognized, would affect the effective rate on income from continuing operations. The Company classifies interest and penalties on income tax uncertainties as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and penalties as of March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018, were not significant. The following table provides the changes in unrecognized tax benefits at March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018: (Dollars in thousands) March 30, 2019 March 31, 2018 Unrecognized tax benefits, beginning of period $ 1,246 $ 1,261 Increase related to tax positions taken during a prior period 44 43 Decreases related to tax positions taken during a prior period — (58 ) Reductions as a result of a lapse of the applicable statute of limitations (647 ) — Unrecognized tax benefits, end of period $ 643 $ 1,246 The Company estimates no material changes to uncertain tax benefits in the next twelve months. T he Company is no longer subject to foreign tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to fiscal 2015. The Company’s U.S. subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal and state tax examinations by tax authorities for fiscal 2016 through fiscal 2019. In October 2018, the Company received a notice of examination from the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) for the Company’s federal income tax return for the fiscal year ended April 1, 2017. The Company does not anticipate any audit adjustments that will result in a material change. 1 3 . Equity-Based Compensation The Company has equity incentive plans under which the Company has been authorized to grant share-based awards to key employees and non-employee directors. Equity-based compensation expense of $102.0 million, $0.6 million, and $0.6 million was recognized in fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. Included in equity-based compensation in fiscal 2019 is $6.0 million of expense related to former Skyline employees that vested in conjunction with the Exchange. Equity-based compensation expense was included in SG&A expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. The total associated income tax benefit recognized was $0.2 million in fiscal 2019, and zero in both fiscal 2018 and 2017. Total unrecognized equity-based compensation for all share-based payment plans was $8.4 million at March 30, 2019, of which $6.1 million will be recognized in fiscal 2020, $2.2 million in fiscal 2021 and $0.1 million thereafter, or a weighted-average period of 1.5 years. F-24 Table of Contents Time-Vesting and Performance-Vesting Restricted Share Awards Champion Holdings granted awards to its officers, management employees and certain members of the Board of Managers under an equity-classified management incentive plan (the “MIP”). In accordance with the provisions of the MIP, as modified on June 1, 2018, unvested units Champion Holdings granted under the MIP were exchanged for unregistered, time-vesting restricted shares and performance-vesting restricted shares of the Company subject to stock restriction agreements (the “SRAs”). The exchange was accounted for as a modification. The time-vesting restricted shares contained service conditions in which vesting would occur 20% per year over a five-year period, unless certain performance conditions were achieved in which vesting would occur immediately upon a change of control or upon an occurrence of a follow-on public offering as defined in the SRAs. During fiscal 2019, a significant portion of the outstanding restricted shares vested in conjunction with certain follow-on public offerings. The incremental fair value of the modification of the awards was $95.1 million and was recognized in fiscal 2019 as all vesting conditions were met during the period. A summary of the activity associated with these awards is as follows: (in thousands) Management Incentive Plan Award Units Time Vesting Restricted Share Awards Performance Vesting Restricted Share Awards Outstanding at April 2, 2016 11,754 — — Granted 988 — — Forfeited (238 ) — — Outstanding at April 1, 2017 12,504 — — Granted 351 — — Forfeited (200 ) — — Outstanding at March 31, 2018 12,655 — — Granted 1,000 — — Forfeited — — — Exchange of MIP awards for RSA Awards (13,655 ) 290 3,686 Vested — — (3,686 ) Outstanding at March 30, 2019 — 290 — On September 26, 2018, the Company’s shareholders approved the Company’s 2018 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Equity Plan”) which provides for grants of options, stock appreciation rights, restricted and unrestricted stock and stock units, performance awards, and other awards convertible into or otherwise based on shares of the Company’s common stock. Prior to the approval of the Equity Plan, the Company maintained the Skyline Corporation 2015 Stock Incentive Plan, which allowed for the grant of stock options and other equity awards. General terms and methods of valuation for the Company’s share-based awards granted under the Equity Plan are described below. F-25 Table of Contents Stock Options Stock options have terms of 10 years, with one-third of each grant vesting each year for three years, and are assigned an exercise price equal to the higher of the VWAP or closing market price of a share of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. When determining expected volatility, the Company considered volatility of guideline public companies. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant, based on the options’ expected term. The expected term of the options is based on the time period to exercise for each vesting tranche, which is calculated based on the average of 1) the full option contractual term and 2) the starting vest date. The total intrinsic value of options outstanding at March 30, 2019, representing the difference between the exercise price and the market price at March 30, 2019, was approximately $0.6 million. A summary of the activity associated with these awards is as follows: Shares (in thousands) Weighted Average Exercise Price Per Share Weighted Average Remaining Term (in years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value (in thousands) Outstanding at March 31, 2018 — Granted 146 Exercised — Outstanding at March 30, 2019 146 $ 15.00 5.50 $ 584 Vested and expected to vest at March 30, 2019 146 $ 15.00 5.50 $ 584 Exercisable at March 30, 2019 — — — — Performance Share Units In fiscal 2019, the Company issued performance share units that contain market vesting conditions and service conditions. The market condition is based on the Company’s total shareholder return (“TSR”) compared to the median TSR of certain companies over a three year performance period. The Company used a Monte-Carlo simulation to determine the grant date fair value for these awards, which takes into consideration the possible outcomes pertaining to the TSR market condition. In general, 0% to 150% of the Company’s performance share units vest at the end of a three year service period from the date of service based upon achievement of the market condition as specified in the performance share unit agreement. A summary of the activity associated with these awards is as follows: Shares (in thousands) Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Per Unit Outstanding at March 31, 2018 — Granted 146 $ 3.62 Vested — Outstanding at March 30, 2019 146 Restricted Share Units and Restricted Share Awards Restricted stock units are valued at the market price of a share of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. In general, these awards have graded vesting conditions in which a portion of awards vest ratably in equal installments on the anniversary of the service date. The total fair value of restricted stock awards vesting was approximately $8.5 million.

Earnings Per Share Basic net (loss) income per share (“EPS”) attributable to the Company was computed by dividing net (loss) income attributable to the Company by the average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The Company’s time-vesting and performance-vesting restricted share awards are considered participating securities. Diluted earnings per common share is computed based on the more dilutive of (i) the two-class method, assuming the participating securities are not exercised or converted; or (ii) the summation of average common shares outstanding and additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential common shares had been issued. During the fiscal years ended March 30, 2019, March 31, 2018, and April 1, 2017, the two-class method was more dilutive. The number of shares used to calculate earnings per share prior to the Exchange was determined based on the exchange ratio, as defined in the Exchange Agreement. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share: Year Ended (Dollars and shares in thousands, except per share data) March 30, 2019 March 31, 2018 April 1, 2017 Numerator: Net (loss) income from continuing operations $ (58,208 ) $ 15,800 $ 51,327 Net income (loss) from discontinued operations — — 583 Undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities — (996 ) (3,373 ) Net (loss) income attributable to the Company's common shareholders $ (58,208 ) $ 14,804 $ 48,537 Denominator: Basic weighted average shares outstanding 53,491 44,491 44,489 Dilutive securities — — — Diluted weighted average shares outstanding 53,491 44,491 44,489 Basic net (loss) income per share: Continuing operations $ (1.09 ) $ 0.33 $ 1.08 Discontinued operations — — 0.01 Basic net (loss) income per share $ (1.09 ) $ 0.33 $ 1.09 Diluted net (loss) income per share: Continuing operations $ (1.09 ) $ 0.33 $ 1.08 Discontinued operations — — 0.01 Diluted net (loss) income per share $ (1.09 ) $ 0.33 $ 1.09 F-27 Table of Contents Securities that could potentially dilute basic EPS in the future that were considered antidilutive in fiscal 2019 are shown below: Type of security Shares and units (in thousands) Options 146 Restricted share units 158 Performance share units 146 Total dilutive securities 450 15. Retirement Plans The Company’s U.S. subsidiary sponsors a defined contribution savings plan covering most U.S. employees. Full-time employees covered by the plan are eligible to participate. Participating employees may contribute from 1% to 25% of their compensation to the plan, with the Company matching 50% of the first 6% of pay contributed. The Company match vests after three years of employment. The Company recognized expense of $0.6 million this plan during fiscal 2019. The Company made no matching contributions to this plan in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017. Full-time employees of the Company’s subsidiaries in Canada are generally covered by employer-sponsored defined contribution plans that require employee contributions and employer matching contributions. The Company recognized expense of $0.6 million, $0.6 million and $0.5 million for these plans during fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 1 6 . Transactions with Related Parties Prior to the Exchange, the Company was party to a Management Advisory Services Agreement (“Services Agreement”) with Centerbridge Advisors, LLC (“Centerbridge”) ; MAK Management L.P.(“MAK”); and Sankaty Advisors, LLC ((“Bain”), and collectively, the “Managers”), affiliates of which collectively owned a majority of the units of the Company and the Company’s common stock (the “Principal Shareholders”), whereby the Principal Shareholders provided management, consulting, financial and other advisory services to the Company in exchange for an annual management fee totaling $1.5 million plus reimbursable expenses. Management fee expense during fiscal 2019, recognized prior to the Exchange, was $0.3 million. The Service Agreement was terminated in connection with the Exchange. Management fee expense was $1.5 million for both fiscal 2018 and 2017. Management fee expense is included in SG&A expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. On June 1, 2018, the Company, the Principal Shareholders, Champion Holdings and certain other parties entered into a registration rights agreement providing for, among other things, customary demand registration rights in favor of the Principal Shareholders and “piggyback” registration rights in favor of the Principal Shareholders, and Arthur J. Decio. As the result of a secondary offering by the Principal Shareholders on September 25, 2018, the Principal Shareholders held less than 50% of the Company’s outstanding shares, and two of the Principal Shareholders Bain and Centerbridge sold their holdings in the Company and no longer meet ownership thresholds to participate in the registration rights agreement. Principal Shareholders MAK and Arthur J. Decio continue to hold registration rights in their favor. On June 1, 2018 the Company, the Principal Shareholders and Champion Holdings entered into an investor rights agreement (the “Investor Rights Agreement”). The Investor Rights Agreement provides for, among other things, certain information rights and certain agreements relating to the composition of the Board of Directors. As the result of Bain and Centerbridge selling their holdings in the Company, they no longer meet the ownership thresholds to participate in the Investor Rights Agreement. Additionally, the Company and Champion Holdings entered into a transition services agreement, pursuant to which the Company will provide certain services to Champion Holdings, including accounting and financial reporting services, tax services, cash and capital management services and services relating to Champion Holdings’ members and liquidation. On January 20, 2017, the Company completed the sale of Champion U.K. to an entity controlled by one of the Principal Shareholders. See additional discussion on the disposition in Note 3, Discontinued Operations. F-28 Table of Contents 1 7 . Segment Information Financial results for the Company's reportable segments have been prepared using a management approach, which is consistent with the basis and manner in which financial information is evaluated by the Company's chief operating decision maker in allocating resources and in assessing performance. The Company’s chief operating decision maker, the Chief Executive Officer, evaluates the performance of the Company’s segment primarily based on net sales, before elimination of inter-company shipments, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) and operating assets. The Company operates in two reportable segments: (i) U.S. Factory-built Housing, which includes manufacturing and retail housing operations and (ii) Canadian Factory-built Housing. Corporate/Other includes the Company’s transportation operations, corporate costs directly incurred for all segments and intersegment eliminations. Segments are generally determined by geography.

Commitments, Contingencies and Concentrations Repurchase Contingencies and Guarantees A significant portion of the Company’s sales to independent retailers are made pursuant to repurchase agreements with lending institutions that provide wholesale floor plan financing to retailers. The Company enters into two types of repurchase agreements, (i) those that allow repurchase up to 24 months after the sale of a home to the retailer, and (ii) those that allow for repurchase until the home is sold by the retailer. For those homes sold to retailers with an unlimited repurchase period, the Company’s risk of loss upon repurchase declines due to required monthly principal payments by the retailer. After 24 or 30 months from the date of the Company’s sale of the home, the risk of loss on these homes is low, and by the 46th month, most programs require that the home be paid in full, at which time the Company no longer has risk of loss. During the repurchase period, generally upon default by the retailer and repossession by the financial institution, the Company is obligated to repurchase the homes from the lender. Before including the reduction from the resale value of the homes, the contingent repurchase obligation as of March 30, 2019 was estimated to be approximately $173.4 million. Losses under repurchase obligations represent the difference between the repurchase price and net proceeds from the resale of the homes, less accrued rebates, which will not be paid. Losses incurred on homes repurchased were immaterial during each of the fiscal years ended March 30, 2019, March 31, 2018 and April 1, 2017. The reserve for estimated losses under repurchase agreements was $1.0 million at March 30, 2019 and $0.7 million at March 31, 2018. The Company guarantees a portion of its customers’ floor plan obligations beyond the customary repurchase arrangements discussed above. The Company has agreed to guarantee from 3% to 50% of certain retailers’ outstanding loans to a floor plan lender. At March 30, 2019, those guarantees totaled $0.8 million of which $0.8 million was outstanding. At March 30, 2019, the Company was contingently obligated for approximately $21.0 million under letters of credit, primarily consisting of $12.6 million to support long-term debt, $7.9 million to support the casualty insurance program, $0.2 million to support repurchase obligations, and $0.3 million to support bonding agreements. The letters of credit are issued from a sub-facility under the Credit Agreement. The Company was also contingently obligated for $23.6 million under surety bonds, generally to support performance on long-term construction contracts, as well as license and service bonding requirements. In the normal course of business, the Company’s former subsidiaries that operated in the United Kingdom historically provided certain guarantees to two customers. Those guarantees provide contractual liability for proven construction defects up to 12 years from the date of delivery of certain products. The guarantees remain a contingent liability of the Company which declines over time through October 2027. As of the date of this report, the Company expects few, if any, claims to be reported under the terms of the guarantees. Operating Leases The Company’s trucking and retail sales locations, certain active manufacturing facilities, a corporate office, and certain equipment and vehicles are leased under operating leases with terms that generally range from 3 to 10 years. Net rent expense was $6.6 million, $5.8 million and $5.0 million during fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. As of March 30. 2019, the Company had the following minimum rental commitments under non-cancellable operating leases by fiscal year: Fiscal 2020 $ 5,302 Fiscal 2021 3,805 Fiscal 2022 3,037 Fiscal 2023 2,273 Fiscal 2024 1,040 Thereafter 2,998 $ 18,455 Legal Proceedings The Company has agreed to indemnify counterparties in the ordinary course of its business in agreements to acquire and sell business assets and in financing arrangements. The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of its business. As of the date of this filing, the Company believes the ultimate liability with respect to these contingent obligations will not have, either individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. F-31 Table of Contents Concentrations The components and products used in the factory-built housing operations are presently available from a variety of vendors, and the Company is not dependent upon any single supplier. Prices of certain materials, such as lumber, insulation, steel and drywall, can fluctuate significantly due to changes in demand and supply. Additionally, availability of certain materials, such as drywall and insulation, has sometimes been limited, resulting in higher prices and/or the need to find alternative suppliers. The Company generally has been able to pass higher material costs on to its retailers and customers in the form of surcharges and price increases. For fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, sales from the Company’s Canadian operations were approximately 7%, 9% and 11%, respectively, of consolidated sales. As of March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018, the Company’s net assets in Canada totaled approximately $41.6 million and $35.9 million, respectively. As of March 30, 2019, the Company had approximately 7,000 employees. Approximately 850 were employed at the Company’s manufacturing facilities in Canada, of which approximately 700 are subject to five separate collective bargaining agreements. At March 30, 2019, two agreements, covering 400 employees, expire in November 2019 and June 2020. 19 .

Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company’s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.” The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.

Segments The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. Markets and Distribution The Company’s customers are primarily in the consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise and government markets. The Company sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. The Company also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels, such as third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. During 2023, the Company’s net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 37% and 63%, respectively, of total net sales. Competition The markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive, and are characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. Many of the Company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company’s products and infringing on its intellectual property. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 2 The Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service features (including security features), relative price and performance, product and service quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and accessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, and corporate reputation. The Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories, and services. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software, and service offerings with large customer bases. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company’s services compete with business models that provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company’s product features and applications within their products, or collaborate to offer integrated solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. Supply of Components Although most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements. The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Research and Development Because the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through research and development (“R&D”), licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology. Intellectual Property The Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices, accessories, software and services. This includes patents, designs, copyrights, trademarks and other forms of intellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although the Company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in differentiating its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel. The Company regularly files patent, design, copyright and trademark applications to protect innovations arising from its research, development, design and marketing, and is currently pursuing thousands of applications around the world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued and registered intellectual property rights around the world. No single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company’s products and services. The Company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products and services. In addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the Company’s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of the Company’s products, processes and services. While the Company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 3 Business Seasonality and Product Introductions The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction. Human Capital The Company believes it has a talented, motivated and dedicated team, and works to create an inclusive, safe and supportive environment for all of its team members. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had approximately 161,000 full-time equivalent employees. Workplace Practices and Policies The Company is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion and diversity and to providing a workplace free of harassment or discrimination. Compensation and Benefits The Company believes that compensation should be competitive and equitable, and should enable employees to share in the Company’s success. The Company recognizes its people are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their needs and the time and support to succeed in their professional and personal lives. In support of this, the Company offers a wide variety of benefits for employees around the world and invests in tools and resources that are designed to support employees’ individual growth and development. Inclusion and Diversity The Company is committed to its vision to build and sustain a more inclusive workforce that is representative of the communities it serves. The Company continues to work to increase diverse representation at every level, foster an inclusive culture, and support equitable pay and access to opportunity for all employees. Engagement The Company believes that open and honest communication among team members, managers and leaders helps create an open, collaborative work environment where everyone can contribute, grow and succeed. Team members are encouraged to come to their managers with questions, feedback or concerns, and the Company conducts surveys that gauge employee sentiment in areas like career development, manager performance and inclusivity. Health and Safety The Company is committed to protecting its team members everywhere it operates. The Company identifies potential workplace risks in order to develop measures to mitigate possible hazards. The Company supports employees with general safety, security and crisis management training, and by putting specific programs in place for those working in potentially high-hazard environments. Additionally, the Company works to protect the safety and security of its team members, visitors and customers through its global security team. Available Information The Company’s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to reports filed pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), are filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).

Risk Factors The Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described below. When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely affected. Because of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company’s results of operations and financial condition, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. This discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. This section should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K. Macroeconomic and Industry Risks The Company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’s total net sales. In addition, the Company’s global supply chain is large and complex and a majority of the Company’s supplier facilities, including manufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the U.S. As a result, the Company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions. Adverse macroeconomic conditions, including slow growth or recession, high unemployment, inflation, tighter credit, higher interest rates, and currency fluctuations, can adversely impact consumer confidence and spending and materially adversely affect demand for the Company’s products and services. In addition, consumer confidence and spending can be materially adversely affected in response to changes in fiscal and monetary policy, financial market volatility, declines in income or asset values, and other economic factors. In addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company’s products and services, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic conditions can have a significant impact on the Company’s suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners, and developers. Potential outcomes include financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance business operations; and insolvency. Adverse economic conditions can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company’s trade receivables; the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the Company’s ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair values of the Company’s financial instruments. These and other impacts can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. The Company’s business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions. Political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 5 The Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’s total net sales, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Restrictions on international trade, such as tariffs and other controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, can materially adversely affect the Company’s operations and supply chain and limit the Company’s ability to offer and distribute its products and services to customers. The impact can be particularly significant if these restrictive measures apply to countries and regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations. Restrictive measures can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers, restructuring business relationships, and ceasing to offer third-party applications on its platforms. Changing the Company’s operations in accordance with new or changed restrictions on international trade can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company’s operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, tensions between governments, including the U.S. and China, have in the past led to tariffs and other restrictions being imposed on the Company’s business. If disputes and conflicts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in response could be significantly more severe and restrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company’s business. Political uncertainty surrounding trade and other international disputes could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company’s business. Many of the Company’s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company’s suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company’s control. Global climate change is resulting in certain types of natural disasters, such as droughts, floods, hurricanes and wildfires, occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Such events can make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company’s supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company’s service offerings, and negatively impact consumer spending and demand in affected areas. Following an interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company. The Company’s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While the Company’s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to the Company’s business, and harm to the Company’s reputation. Major public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the future materially adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products; the imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement of products between regions; and disruptions in the Company’s operations, supply chain and sales and distribution channels, resulting in interruptions to the supply of current products and offering of existing services, and delays in production ramps of new products and development of new services. While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise. Global markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets. The Company’s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. The Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in R&D. There can be no assurance these investments will achieve expected returns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 6 The Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to register, additional patents, trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company’s products and infringing on its intellectual property. Effective intellectual property protection is not consistently available in every country in which the Company operates. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the Company’s intellectual property, the Company’s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be materially adversely affected. The Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. Some of the markets in which the Company competes have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall. Additionally, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company’s product features and applications within their products or collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the Company’s approach to providing components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions. The Company’s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition depend substantially on the Company’s ability to continually improve its products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively. Business Risks To remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services. Due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the markets and industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services, and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services. The success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors, including timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company’s ability to manage the risks associated with new technologies and production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for the Company’s products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies. There can be no assurance the Company will successfully manage future introductions and transitions of products and services. The Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of which are located outside of the U.S. Substantially all of the Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam, and a significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Changes or additions to the Company’s supply chain require considerable time and resources and involve significant risks and uncertainties. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements can lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company’s direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished control has from time to time and may in the future have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products manufactured or services provided, or adversely affect the Company’s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product defects and experiences unanticipated product defect liabilities from time to time. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, violations of the supplier code of conduct occur from time to time and can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 7 The Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many components, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company’s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can have a negative impact on the Company’s cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, armed conflict, economic, business, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, or international trade disputes. The Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be reduced or terminated, and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted. Future operating results depend upon the Company’s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms. Because the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the global semiconductor industry has in the past experienced high demand and shortages of supply, which adversely affected the Company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components and products on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Such disruptions could occur in the future. While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The effects of global or regional economic conditions on the Company’s suppliers, described in “ The Company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition, ” above, can also affect the Company’s ability to obtain components . Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company’s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements. When the Company’s supply of components for a new or existing product has been delayed or constrained, or when an outsourcing partner has delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company’s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. The Company’s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the Company’s business and result in harm to the Company’s reputation. The Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the Company, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products and services. Defects can also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects could make the Company’s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the Company’s products are introduced into specialized applications, including health. In addition, the Company’s service offerings can have quality issues and from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, from time to time the Company’s services have not performed as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software and services it offers. Failure to do so can result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the Company’s products and services. In addition, the Company can be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property, plant and equipment or intangible assets, and significant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems can also adversely affect the experience for users of the Company’s products and services, and result in harm to the Company’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 8 The Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk. The Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers’ facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable, there can be no assurance the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes. The Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. Manufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company’s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for periods up to 150 days. Because the Company’s markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments. The Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The Company’s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties, which requires licenses from those third parties. In addition, because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company currently competes or in the future may compete, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, the Company’s products and services can unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Based on experience and industry practice, the Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, can preclude the Company from selling certain products or services, or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company’s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers. The Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications and services. There can be no assurance third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the Company’s products. If third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company’s products, customers may choose not to buy the Company’s products. The Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers’ perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the Company’s products compared to competitors’ platforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets, Windows for personal computers and tablets, and PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for gaming platforms. This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of product sales, and the costs of developing such applications and services. The Company’s minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets can make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company’s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors’ products with larger market share. When developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company’s devices can suffer. The Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products. The Company’s products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and when third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, their applications can fail to take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences, can operate incorrectly, and can result in dissatisfied customers and lower customer demand for the Company’s products. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 9 The Company distributes third-party applications for its products through the App Store. For the vast majority of applications, developers keep all of the revenue they generate on the App Store. The Company retains a commission from sales of applications and sales of digital services or goods initiated within an application. From time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to competition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements. The Company expects to make further business changes in the future, including as a result of legislative initiatives impacting the App Store, such as the European Union (“EU”) Digital Markets Act, which the Company is required to comply with by March 2024. The Company is also subject to litigation and investigations relating to the App Store, which have resulted in changes to the Company’s business practices, and may in the future result in further changes. Changes have included how developers communicate with consumers outside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. Future changes could also affect what the Company charges developers for access to its platforms, how it manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store, and how and to what extent it allows developers to communicate with consumers inside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. This could reduce the volume of sales, and the commission that the Company earns on those sales, would decrease. If the rate of the commission that the Company retains on such sales is reduced, or if it is otherwise narrowed in scope or eliminated, the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Failure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the Company’s customers, or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell, or offer subscriptions to, third-party content, as well as the right to incorporate specific content into the Company’s own services. The licensing or other distribution arrangements for this content can be for relatively short time periods and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and can take actions to make it difficult or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company’s access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules. The Company also produces its own digital content, which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing competition for talent, content and subscribers, and may fail to appeal to the Company’s customers. Some third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. If requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner. The Company’s success depends largely on the talents and efforts of its team members, the continued service and availability of highly skilled employees, including key personnel, and the Company’s ability to nurture its distinctive and inclusive culture. Much of the Company’s future success depends on the talents and efforts of its team members and the continued availability and service of key personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly skilled employees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley, where most of the Company’s key personnel are located. In addition to intense competition for talent, workforce dynamics are constantly evolving. If the Company does not manage changing workforce dynamics effectively, it could materially adversely affect the Company’s culture, reputation and operational flexibility. The Company believes that its distinctive and inclusive culture is a significant driver of its success. If the Company is unable to nurture its culture, it could materially adversely affect the Company’s ability to recruit and retain the highly skilled employees who are critical to its success, and could otherwise materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. The Company depends on the performance of carriers, wholesalers, retailers and other resellers. The Company distributes its products and certain of its services through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers, many of which distribute products and services from competitors. The Company also sells its products and services and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. Some carriers providing cellular network service for the Company’s products offer financing, installment payment plans or subsidies for users’ purchases of the device. There can be no assurance such offers will be continued at all or in the same amounts. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 10 The Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers’ stores with Company employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays. These programs can require a substantial investment while not assuring return or incremental sales. The financial condition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Company’s products, or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the Company’s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company’s products. The Company’s business and reputation are impacted by information technology system failures and network disruptions. The Company and its global supply chain are dependent on complex information technology systems and are exposed to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, ransomware or other cybersecurity incidents, or other events or disruptions. System upgrades, redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company’s or its vendors’ business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions can adversely impact the Company’s business by, among other things, preventing access to the Company’s online services, interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the Company’s products. These events could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. Losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personal information, could subject the Company to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences. The Company’s business requires it to use and store confidential information, including personal information, with respect to the Company’s customers and employees. The Company devotes significant resources to network and data security, including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data. But these measures cannot provide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. The Company’s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties. The Company relies on global suppliers that are also exposed to ransomware and other malicious attacks that can disrupt business operations. Although the Company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to or accessible by third parties working on the Company’s behalf, such measures are not always effective and losses or unauthorized access to, or releases of, confidential information occur. Such incidents and other malicious attacks could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. The Company experiences malicious attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to its systems on a regular basis. These attacks seek to compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential information or disrupt normal business operations, and can, among other things, impair the Company’s ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services, impact the Company’s stock price, materially damage commercial relationships, and expose the Company to litigation or government investigations, which could result in penalties, fines or judgments against the Company. Globally, attacks are expected to continue accelerating in both frequency and sophistication with increasing use by actors of tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent controls, avoid detection, and remove or obfuscate forensic evidence, all of which hinders the Company’s ability to identify, investigate and recover from incidents. In addition, attacks against the Company and its customers can escalate during periods of severe diplomatic or armed conflict. Although malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information, including personal information, affect many companies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and processes. The Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data, and mitigate the impact of unauthorized access, including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies. As with all companies, these security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking, ransomware attacks, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty password management or other irregularities. For example, third parties can fraudulently induce the Company’s or its vendors’ employees or customers into disclosing usernames, passwords or other sensitive information, which can, in turn, be used for unauthorized access to the Company’s or its vendors’ systems and services. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company deploys and makes available technologies like multifactor authentication, monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, can result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the Company’s products and services. While the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 11 Investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company’s ongoing business, present risks not originally contemplated and materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. The Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater-than-expected liabilities and expenses, economic, political, legal and regulatory challenges associated with operating in new businesses, regions or countries, inadequate return on capital, potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets, and significant write-offs. Investment and acquisition transactions are exposed to additional risks, including failing to obtain required regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all, or the imposition of onerous conditions that could delay or prevent the Company from completing a transaction or otherwise limit the Company’s ability to fully realize the anticipated benefits of a transaction. These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful. The failure of any significant investment could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. The Company’s retail stores are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. The Company’s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition, including macroeconomic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity. Other factors include the Company’s ability to: manage costs associated with retail store construction and operation; manage relationships with existing retail partners; manage costs associated with fluctuations in the value of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost. Legal and Regulatory Compliance Risks The Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings or government investigations. The Company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved, and new matters may arise in the future. In addition, agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which can subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. The number of claims, legal proceedings and government investigations involving the Company, and the alleged magnitude of such claims, proceedings and government investigations, has generally increased over time and may continue to increase. The Company has faced and continues to face a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled products, and new claims may arise in the future, including as a result of new legal or regulatory frameworks. For example, technology and other patent-holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in several U.S. jurisdictions, as well as internationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages. Regardless of the merit of particular claims, defending against litigation or responding to government investigations can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company’s operations. In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such challenges. There can be no assurance such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These agreements can also significantly increase the Company’s cost of sales and operating expenses and require the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company’s ability to offer certain products and services. Except as described in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading “Legal Proceedings” and in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 12, “Commitments, Contingencies and Supply Concentrations” under the heading “Contingencies,” in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims. The outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s results of operations and financial condition for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome can result in significant compensatory, punitive or trebled monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company, and has from time to time required, and can in the future require, the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company’s ability to offer certain products and services, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 12 The Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects on the Company’s business. The Company’s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects, including antitrust; privacy, data security and data localization; consumer protection; advertising, sales, billing and e-commerce; financial services and technology; product liability; intellectual property ownership and infringement; digital platforms; machine learning and artificial intelligence; internet, telecommunications and mobile communications; media, television, film and digital content; availability of third-party software applications and services; labor and employment; anticorruption; import, export and trade; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; anti–money laundering; foreign ownership and investment; tax; and environmental, health and safety, including electronic waste, recycling, product design and climate change. Compliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive. New and changing laws and regulations can adversely affect the Company’s business by increasing the Company’s costs, limiting the Company’s ability to offer a product, service or feature to customers, imposing changes to the design of the Company’s products and services, impacting customer demand for the Company’s products and services, and requiring changes to the Company’s supply chain and its business. New and changing laws and regulations can also create uncertainty about how such laws and regulations will be interpreted and applied. These risks and costs may increase as the Company’s products and services are introduced into specialized applications, including health and financial services. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance the Company’s employees, contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company’s policies and procedures. If the Company is found to have violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. Regulatory changes and other actions that materially adversely affect the Company’s business may be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, the Company is subject to changing regulations relating to the export and import of its products. Although the Company has programs, policies and procedures in place that are designed to satisfy regulatory requirements, there can be no assurance that such policies and procedures will be effective in preventing a violation or a claim of a violation. As a result, the Company’s products could be banned, delayed or prohibited from importation, which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. Expectations relating to environmental, social and governance considerations and related reporting obligations expose the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs, reputational harm, and other adverse effects on the Company’s business. Many governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental, social and governance considerations relating to businesses, including climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, human and civil rights, and diversity, equity and inclusion. In addition, the Company makes statements about its goals and initiatives through its various non-financial reports, information provided on its website, press statements and other communications. Responding to these environmental, social and governance considerations and implementation of these goals and initiatives involves risks and uncertainties, requires investments, and depends in part on third-party performance or data that is outside the Company’s control. The Company cannot guarantee that it will achieve its announced environmental, social and governance goals and initiatives. In addition, some stakeholders may disagree with the Company’s goals and initiatives. Any failure, or perceived failure, by the Company to achieve its goals, further its initiatives, adhere to its public statements, comply with federal, state or international environmental, social and governance laws and regulations, or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could result in legal and regulatory proceedings against the Company and materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. The technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and regulatory scrutiny, which exposes the Company to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions and penalties. From time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to litigation, competition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements. The Company expects to make further business changes in the future, including as a result of legislative initiatives impacting the App Store, such as the EU Digital Markets Act, which the Company is required to comply with by March 2024, or similar laws in other jurisdictions. Changes have included how developers communicate with consumers outside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. Future changes could also affect what the Company charges developers for access to its platforms, how it manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store, and how and to what extent it allows developers to communicate with consumers inside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 13 The Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations in various jurisdictions around the world, which can result in legal proceedings and claims against the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company is the subject of investigations in Europe and other jurisdictions relating to App Store terms and conditions. If such investigations result in adverse findings against the Company, the Company could be exposed to significant fines and may be required to make changes to its App Store business, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company is also subject to litigation relating to the App Store, which has resulted in changes to the Company’s business practices, and may in the future result in further changes. Further, the Company has commercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that are or may become subject to investigations and litigation that, if resolved against those other companies, could materially adversely affect the Company’s commercial relationships with those business partners and materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company earns revenue from licensing arrangements with other companies to offer their search services on the Company’s platforms and applications, and certain of these arrangements are currently subject to government investigations and legal proceedings. There can be no assurance the Company’s business will not be materially adversely affected, individually or in the aggregate, by the outcomes of such investigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future. Changes to the Company’s business practices to comply with new laws and regulations or in connection with other legal proceedings could negatively impact the reputation of the Company’s products for privacy and security and otherwise adversely affect the experience for users of the Company’s products and services, and result in harm to the Company’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, and lost sales. The Company’s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding data protection. The Company is subject to an increasing number of federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of various types of personal information. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also restrict transfers of personal information among the Company and its international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and additional jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions or have laws that are pending. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing requirements causes the Company to incur substantial costs and has required and may in the future require the Company to change its business practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability. The Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of personal information through its privacy policy, information provided on its website, press statements and other privacy notices provided to customers. Any failure by the Company to comply with these public statements or with other federal, state or international privacy or data protection laws and regulations could result in inquiries or proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. In addition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability. In addition to the risks generally relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal information, the Company is also subject to specific obligations relating to information considered sensitive under applicable laws, such as health data, financial data and biometric data. Health data and financial data are subject to additional privacy, security and breach notification requirements, and the Company is subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the Company’s compliance with these obligations. If the Company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements, or if health data or financial data is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the Company’s agreements with healthcare or financial institutions, the Company can be subject to litigation or government investigations, and can be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and can also incur significant fees or fines. Payment card data is also subject to additional requirements. Under payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder information is potentially compromised, the Company can be liable for associated investigatory expenses and can also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards. The Company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards, which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 14 Financial Risks The Company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate. The Company’s profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For example, the gross margins on the Company’s products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The Company’s gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in response to such pressures; increased competition; the Company’s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering content for the Company’s services; the Company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that regulatory changes require the Company to modify its product and service offerings; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; inflation and other macroeconomic pressures; and the introduction of new products or services, including new products or services with higher cost structures. These and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition. The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company’s products or services, issues with new product or service introductions, information technology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company’s logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners. The Company’s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies. The Company’s primary exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates relates to non–U.S. dollar–denominated sales, cost of sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company’s products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers have in the past been adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations. The weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company’s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar’s strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency–denominated sales. Conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing or incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Company’s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins. The Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place. The Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio. The Company’s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and economic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 15 The Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen. The Company distributes its products and certain of its services through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. The Company also sells its products and services directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the Company’s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant portion of the Company’s trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers. The Company’s exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September 30, 2023, the Company’s vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses. The Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and exposure to additional tax liabilities. The Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland and Singapore, where a number of the Company’s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws and tax rates for income taxes and other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. For example, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development continues to advance proposals for modernizing international tax rules, including the introduction of global minimum tax standards. The Company’s effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, and changes in tax laws or their interpretation. The application of tax laws may be uncertain, require significant judgment and be subject to differing interpretations. The Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company’s effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of the Company’s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. General Risks The price of the Company’s stock is subject to volatility. The Company’s stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, the Company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have, from time to time, experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies’ operating performance. Price volatility may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its stock in a given period to exceed the stock’s price at a given point in time. The Company believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability. The Company also believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow, and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Company’s Board of Directors, and the Company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, the price of the Company’s stock may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. Item 1C. Cybersecurity Not applicable. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 16 Item 2. Properties The Company’s headquarters is located in Cupertino, California. As of September 30, 2023, the Company owned or leased facilities and land for corporate functions, R&D, data centers, retail and other purposes at locations throughout the U.S. and in various places outside the U.S. The Company believes its existing facilities and equipment, which are used by all reportable segments, are in good operating condition and are suitable for the conduct of its business. Item 3. Legal Proceedings Epic Games Epic Games, Inc. (“Epic”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the “District Court”) against the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California’s unfair competition law based upon the Company’s operation of its App Store. On September 10, 2021, the District Court ruled in favor of the Company with respect to nine out of the ten counts included in Epic’s claim. The District Court found that certain provisions of the Company’s App Store Review Guidelines violate California’s unfair competition law and issued an injunction enjoining the Company from prohibiting developers from including in their apps external links that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than Apple in-app purchasing. The injunction applies to apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store. On April 24, 2023, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (the “Circuit Court”) affirmed the District Court’s ruling. On June 7, 2023, the Company and Epic filed petitions with the Circuit Court requesting further review of the decision. On June 30, 2023, the Circuit Court denied both petitions. On July 17, 2023, the Circuit Court granted Apple’s motion to stay enforcement of the injunction pending appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. If the U.S. Supreme Court denies Apple’s petition, the stay of the injunction will expire. Masimo Masimo Corporation and Cercacor Laboratories, Inc. (together, “Masimo”) filed a complaint before the U.S. International Trade Commission (the “ITC”) alleging infringement by the Company of five patents relating to the functionality of the blood oxygen feature in Apple Watch Series 6 and 7. In its complaint, Masimo sought a permanent exclusion order prohibiting importation to the United States of certain Apple Watch models that include blood oxygen sensing functionality. On October 26, 2023, the ITC entered a limited exclusion order (the “Order”) prohibiting importation and sales in the United States of Apple Watch models with blood oxygen sensing functionality, which includes Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2. The Order will not go into effect until the end of the administrative review period, which is currently expected to end on December 25, 2023. The Company intends to appeal the Order and seek a stay pending the appeal. Other Legal Proceedings The Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the fourth quarter of 2023 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures Not applicable. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 17 PART II Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities The Company’s common stock is traded on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC under the symbol AAPL. Holders As of October 20, 2023, there were 23,763 shareholders of record. Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers Share repurchase activity during the three months ended September 30, 2023 was as follows (in millions, except number of shares, which are reflected in thousands, and per-share amounts): Periods Total Number of Shares Purchased Average Price Paid Per Share Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs Approximate Dollar Value of Shares That May Yet Be Purchased Under the Plans or Programs (1) July 2, 2023 to August 5, 2023: Open market and privately negotiated purchases 33,864 $ 191.62 33,864 August 6, 2023 to September 2, 2023: August 2023 ASRs 22,085 (2) (2) 22,085 (2) Open market and privately negotiated purchases 30,299 $ 178.99 30,299 September 3, 2023 to September 30, 2023: Open market and privately negotiated purchases 20,347 $ 176.31 20,347 Total 106,595 $ 74,069 (1) As of September 30, 2023, the Company was authorized by the Board of Directors to purchase up to $90 billion of the Company’s common stock under a share repurchase program announced on May 4, 2023, of which $15.9 billion had been utilized. During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company also utilized the final $4.6 billion under its previous repurchase program, which was most recently authorized in April 2022. The programs do not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. Under the programs, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act. (2) In August 2023, the Company entered into new accelerated share repurchase agreements (“ASRs”). Under the terms of the ASRs, two financial institutions committed to deliver shares of the Company’s common stock during the purchase periods in exchange for up-front payments totaling $5.0 billion. The total number of shares ultimately delivered under the ASRs, and therefore the average repurchase price paid per share, is determined based on the volume-weighted average price of the Company’s common stock during the ASRs’ purchase periods, which end in the first quarter of 2024.

[Reserved] Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 19 Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This Item generally discusses 2023 and 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022. Discussions of 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021 are not included, and can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022. Fiscal Period The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company’s fiscal year 2023 spanned 53 weeks, whereas fiscal years 2022 and 2021 spanned 52 weeks each. Fiscal Year Highlights The Company’s total net sales were $383.3 billion and net income was $97.0 billion during 2023. The Company’s total net sales decreased 3% or $11.0 billion during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in total net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and iPhone, partially offset by higher net sales of Services. The Company announces new product, service and software offerings at various times during the year. Significant announcements during fiscal year 2023 included the following: First Quarter 2023: • iPad and iPad Pro; • Next-generation Apple TV 4K; and • MLS Season Pass, a Major League Soccer subscription streaming service. Second Quarter 2023: • MacBook Pro 14”, MacBook Pro 16” and Mac mini; and • Second-generation HomePod. Third Quarter 2023: • MacBook Air 15”, Mac Studio and Mac Pro; • Apple Vision Pro™, the Company’s first spatial computer featuring its new visionOS™, expected to be available in early calendar year 2024; and • iOS 17, macOS Sonoma, iPadOS 17, tvOS 17 and watchOS 10, updates to the Company’s operating systems. Fourth Quarter 2023: • iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max; and • Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2. In May 2023, the Company announced a new share repurchase program of up to $90 billion and raised its quarterly dividend from $0.23 to $0.24 per share beginning in May 2023. During 2023, the Company repurchased $76.6 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $15.0 billion.

Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 22 Gross Margin Products and Services gross margin and gross margin percentage for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): 2023 2022 2021 Gross margin: Products $ 108,803 $ 114,728 $ 105,126 Services 60,345 56,054 47,710 Total gross margin $ 169,148 $ 170,782 $ 152,836 Gross margin percentage: Products 36.5 % 36.3 % 35.3 % Services 70.8 % 71.7 % 69.7 % Total gross margin percentage 44.1 % 43.3 % 41.8 % Products Gross Margin Products gross margin decreased during 2023 compared to 2022 due to the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and lower Products volume, partially offset by cost savings and a different Products mix. Products gross margin percentage increased during 2023 compared to 2022 due to cost savings and a different Products mix, partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and decreased leverage. Services Gross Margin Services gross margin increased during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to higher Services net sales, partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and higher Services costs. Services gross margin percentage decreased during 2023 compared to 2022 due to higher Services costs and the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, partially offset by a different Services mix. The Company’s future gross margins can be impacted by a variety of factors, as discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.” As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and downward pressure. Operating Expenses Operating expenses for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Research and development $ 29,915 14 % $ 26,251 20 % $ 21,914 Percentage of total net sales 8 % 7 % 6 % Selling, general and administrative $ 24,932 (1) % $ 25,094 14 % $ 21,973 Percentage of total net sales 7 % 6 % 6 % Total operating expenses $ 54,847 7 % $ 51,345 17 % $ 43,887 Percentage of total net sales 14 % 13 % 12 % Research and Development The year-over-year growth in R&D expense in 2023 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses. Selling, General and Administrative Selling, general and administrative expense was relatively flat in 2023 compared to 2022. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 23 Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): 2023 2022 2021 Provision for income taxes $ 16,741 $ 19,300 $ 14,527 Effective tax rate 14.7 % 16.2 % 13.3 % Statutory federal income tax rate 21 % 21 % 21 % The Company’s effective tax rate for 2023 and 2022 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, the impact of the U.S. federal R&D credit, and tax benefits from share-based compensation, partially offset by state income taxes. The Company’s effective tax rate for 2023 was lower compared to 2022 due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings and the impact of U.S. foreign tax credit regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2022, partially offset by lower tax benefits from share-based compensation. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, which totaled $148.3 billion as of September 30, 2023, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond. The Company’s material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations: Debt As of September 30, 2023, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $106.6 billion (collectively the “Notes”), with $9.9 billion payable within 12 months. Future interest payments associated with the Notes total $41.1 billion, with $2.9 billion payable within 12 months. The Company also issues unsecured short-term promissory notes pursuant to a commercial paper program. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had $6.0 billion of commercial paper outstanding, all of which was payable within 12 months. Leases The Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including corporate, data center, manufacturing and retail space. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had fixed lease payment obligations of $15.8 billion, with $2.0 billion payable within 12 months. Manufacturing Purchase Obligations The Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company’s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $53.1 billion, with $52.9 billion payable within 12 months. The Company’s manufacturing purchase obligations are primarily noncancelable. Other Purchase Obligations The Company’s other purchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including assets related to product manufacturing, and noncancelable obligations related to supplier arrangements, licensed intellectual property and content, and distribution rights. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had other purchase obligations of $21.9 billion, with $5.6 billion payable within 12 months. Deemed Repatriation Tax Payable As of September 30, 2023, the balance of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Act”) was $22.0 billion, with $6.5 billion expected to be paid within 12 months. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 24 Capital Return Program In addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has an authorized share repurchase program. The program does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of September 30, 2023, the Company’s quarterly cash dividend was $0.24 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Uncertain Tax Positions The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company’s uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the Act and matters related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company’s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company’s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results. Legal and Other Contingencies The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 25 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to economic risk from interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The Company uses various strategies to manage these risks; however, they may still impact the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Interest Rate Risk The Company is primarily exposed to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates and their impact on the Company’s investment portfolio and term debt. Increases in interest rates will negatively affect the fair value of the Company’s investment portfolio and increase the interest expense on the Company’s term debt. To protect against interest rate risk, the Company may use derivative instruments, offset interest rate–sensitive assets and liabilities, or control duration of the investment and term debt portfolios. The following table sets forth potential impacts on the Company’s investment portfolio and term debt, including the effects of any associated derivatives, that would result from a hypothetical increase in relevant interest rates as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022 (dollars in millions): Interest Rate Sensitive Instrument Hypothetical Interest Rate Increase Potential Impact 2023 2022 Investment portfolio 100 basis points, all tenors Decline in fair value $ 3,089 $ 4,022 Term debt 100 basis points, all tenors Increase in annual interest expense $ 194 $ 201 Foreign Exchange Rate Risk The Company’s exposure to foreign exchange rate risk relates primarily to the Company being a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company’s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in exchange rates may also affect the fair values of certain of the Company’s assets and liabilities. To protect against foreign exchange rate risk, the Company may use derivative instruments, offset exposures, or adjust local currency pricing of its products and services. However, the Company may choose to not hedge certain foreign currency exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or prohibitive cost. The Company applied a value-at-risk (“VAR”) model to its foreign currency derivative positions to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model used a Monte Carlo simulation. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company’s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates, with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $669 million and $1.0 billion as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022, respectively. Changes in the Company’s underlying foreign currency exposures, which were excluded from the assessment, generally offset changes in the fair values of the Company’s foreign currency derivatives.

Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company’s Products net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company’s Services net sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable. The Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer incentive programs based on the Company’s expectations and historical experience. For arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the Company allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (“SSPs”). When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are established that reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company’s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation. The Company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud ® , Siri ® and Maps. The third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company’s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided. For certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For these arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized revenue, and does not disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services. For the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products, including evaluating if it can establish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party applications sold through the App Store, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for all third-party application–related sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission it retains. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 34 Net sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (in millions): 2023 2022 2021 iPhone (1) $ 200,583 $ 205,489 $ 191,973 Mac (1) 29,357 40,177 35,190 iPad (1) 28,300 29,292 31,862 Wearables, Home and Accessories (1) 39,845 41,241 38,367 Services (2) 85,200 78,129 68,425 Total net sales $ 383,285 $ 394,328 $ 365,817 (1) Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are bundled in the sales price of the respective product. (2) Services net sales include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain products. Total net sales include $ 8.2 billion of revenue recognized in 2023 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 24, 2022, $ 7.5 billion of revenue recognized in 2022 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 25, 2021, and $ 6.7 billion of revenue recognized in 2021 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 26, 2020. The Company’s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable segment in Note 13, “Segment Information and Geographic Data” for 2023, 2022 and 2021, except in Greater China, where iPhone revenue represented a moderately higher proportion of net sales. As of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022, the Company had total deferred revenue of $ 12.1 billion and $ 12.4 billion, respectively. As of September 30, 2023, the Company expects 67 % of total deferred revenue to be realized in less than a year, 25 % within one-to-two years, 7 % within two-to-three years and 1 % in greater than three years. Note 3 – Earnings Per Share The following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for 2023, 2022 and 2021 (net income in millions and shares in thousands): 2023 2022 2021 Numerator: Net income $ 96,995 $ 99,803 $ 94,680 Denominator: Weighted-average basic shares outstanding 15,744,231 16,215,963 16,701,272 Effect of dilutive share-based awards 68,316 109,856 163,647 Weighted-average diluted shares 15,812,547 16,325,819 16,864,919 Basic earnings per share $ 6.16 $ 6.15 $ 5.67 Diluted earnings per share $ 6.13 $ 6.11 $ 5.61 Approximately 24 million restricted stock units (“RSUs”) were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for 2023 because their effect would have been antidilutive.

(2) As of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022, total marketable securities included $ 13.8 billion and $ 12.7 billion, respectively, that were restricted from general use, related to the State Aid Decision (refer to Note 7, “Income Taxes”) and other agreements. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 36 The following table shows the fair value of the Company’s non-current marketable debt securities, by contractual maturity, as of September 30, 2023 (in millions): Due after 1 year through 5 years $ 74,427 Due after 5 years through 10 years 9,964 Due after 10 years 16,153 Total fair value $ 100,544 The Company’s investments in marketable debt securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. The Company classifies marketable debt securities as either current or non-current based solely on each instrument’s underlying contractual maturity date. Derivative Instruments and Hedging The Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates. The Company classifies cash flows related to derivative instruments in the same section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as the items being hedged, which are generally classified as operating activities. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, options or other instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months. To protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of September 30, 2023, the maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term debt–related foreign currency transactions is 19 years. The Company may also use derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. Interest Rate Risk To protect the Company’s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may use interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. The notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022 were as follows (in millions): 2023 2022 Derivative instruments designated as accounting hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ 74,730 $ 102,670 Interest rate contracts $ 19,375 $ 20,125 Derivative instruments not designated as accounting hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ 104,777 $ 185,381 Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 37 The gross fair values of the Company’s derivative assets and liabilities as of September 24, 2022 were as follows (in millions): 2022 Fair Value of Derivatives Designated as Accounting Hedges Fair Value of Derivatives Not Designated as Accounting Hedges Total Fair Value Derivative assets (1) : Foreign exchange contracts $ 4,317 $ 2,819 $ 7,136 Derivative liabilities (2) : Foreign exchange contracts $ 2,205 $ 2,547 $ 4,752 Interest rate contracts $ 1,367 $ — $ 1,367 (1) Derivative assets are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current assets and other non-current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. (2) Derivative liabilities are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The derivative assets above represent the Company’s gross credit exposure if all counterparties failed to perform. To mitigate credit risk, the Company generally uses collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair values of certain derivatives fluctuate from contractually established thresholds. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally uses master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to the Company’s derivative contracts, under which the Company is allowed to settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of September 24, 2022, the potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the Company’s derivative contracts, including the effects of collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $ 7.8 billion, resulting in a net derivative asset of $ 412 million. The carrying amounts of the Company’s hedged items in fair value hedges as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022 were as follows (in millions): 2023 2022 Hedged assets/(liabilities): Current and non-current marketable securities $ 14,433 $ 13,378 Current and non-current term debt $ ( 18,247 ) $ ( 18,739 ) Accounts Receivable Trade Receivables As of September 24, 2022, the Company had one customer that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, which accounted for 10 %. The Company’s third-party cellular network carriers accounted for 41 % and 44 % of total trade receivables as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022, respectively. The Company requires third-party credit support or collateral from certain customers to limit credit risk. Vendor Non-Trade Receivables The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. The Company does not reflect the sale of these components in products net sales. Rather, the Company recognizes any gain on these sales as a reduction of products cost of sales when the related final products are sold by the Company. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 48 % and 23 %. As of September 24, 2022, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 54 % and 13 %.

A reconciliation of the provision for income taxes to the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate ( 21 % in 2023, 2022 and 2021) to income before provision for income taxes for 2023, 2022 and 2021, is as follows (dollars in millions): 2023 2022 2021 Computed expected tax $ 23,885 $ 25,012 $ 22,933 State taxes, net of federal effect 1,124 1,518 1,151 Earnings of foreign subsidiaries ( 5,744 ) ( 4,366 ) ( 4,715 ) Research and development credit, net ( 1,212 ) ( 1,153 ) ( 1,033 ) Excess tax benefits from equity awards ( 1,120 ) ( 1,871 ) ( 2,137 ) Foreign-derived intangible income deduction — ( 296 ) ( 1,372 ) Other ( 192 ) 456 ( 300 ) Provision for income taxes $ 16,741 $ 19,300 $ 14,527 Effective tax rate 14.7 % 16.2 % 13.3 % Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 40 Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities As of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022, the significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities were (in millions): 2023 2022 Deferred tax assets: Tax credit carryforwards $ 8,302 $ 6,962 Accrued liabilities and other reserves 6,365 6,515 Capitalized research and development 6,294 1,267 Deferred revenue 4,571 5,742 Unrealized losses 2,447 2,913 Lease liabilities 2,421 2,400 Other 2,343 3,407 Total deferred tax assets 32,743 29,206 Less: Valuation allowance ( 8,374 ) ( 7,530 ) Total deferred tax assets, net 24,369 21,676 Deferred tax liabilities: Right-of-use assets 2,179 2,163 Depreciation 1,998 1,582 Minimum tax on foreign earnings 1,940 1,983 Unrealized gains 511 942 Other 490 469 Total deferred tax liabilities 7,118 7,139 Net deferred tax assets $ 17,251 $ 14,537 As of September 30, 2023, the Company had $ 5.2 billion in foreign tax credit carryforwards in Ireland and $ 3.0 billion in California R&D credit carryforwards, both of which can be carried forward indefinitely. A valuation allowance has been recorded for the credit carryforwards and a portion of other temporary differences. Uncertain Tax Positions As of September 30, 2023, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $ 19.5 billion, of which $ 9.5 billion, if recognized, would impact the Company’s effective tax rate. As of September 24, 2022, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $ 16.8 billion, of which $ 8.0 billion, if recognized, would have impacted the Company’s effective tax rate. The aggregate change in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which excludes interest and penalties, for 2023, 2022 and 2021, is as follows (in millions): 2023 2022 2021 Beginning balances $ 16,758 $ 15,477 $ 16,475 Increases related to tax positions taken during a prior year 2,044 2,284 816 Decreases related to tax positions taken during a prior year ( 1,463 ) ( 1,982 ) ( 1,402 ) Increases related to tax positions taken during the current year 2,628 1,936 1,607 Decreases related to settlements with taxing authorities ( 19 ) ( 28 ) ( 1,838 ) Decreases related to expiration of the statute of limitations ( 494 ) ( 929 ) ( 181 ) Ending balances $ 19,454 $ 16,758 $ 15,477 The Company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and many state and foreign jurisd ictions. Tax years after 2017 for the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and after 2014 in certain major foreign jurisdictions, remain subject to examination. Altho ugh the timing of resolution or closure of examinations is not certain, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that its gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease in the next 12 months by as much as $ 4.5 billion. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 41 European Commission State Aid Decision On August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company (the “State Aid Decision”). The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The recovery amount was calculated to be € 13.1 billion, plus interest of € 1.2 billion. The Company and Ireland appealed the State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the “General Court”). On July 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September 25, 2020, the European Commission appealed the General Court’s decision to the European Court of Justice (the “ECJ”) and a hearing was held on May 23, 2023. A decision from the ECJ is expected in calendar year 2024. The Company believes it would be eligible to claim a U.S. foreign tax credit for a portion of any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision. On an annual basis, the Company may request approval from the Irish Minister for Finance to reduce the recovery amount for certain taxes paid to other countries. As of September 30, 2023, the adjusted recovery amount was € 12.7 billion, excluding interest. The adjusted recovery amount plus interest is funded into escrow, where it will remain restricted from general use pending the conclusion of all legal proceedings. Refer to the Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities section of Note 4, “Financial Instruments” for more information. Note 8 – Leases The Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including corporate, data center, manufacturing and retail space. These leases typically have original terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multiyear renewal options, some of which are reasonably certain of exercise. Payments under the Company’s lease arrangements may be fixed or variable, and variable lease payments are primarily based on purchases of output of the underlying leased assets. Lease costs associated with fixed payments on the Company’s operating leases were $ 2.0 billion, $ 1.9 billion and $ 1.7 billion for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Lease costs associated with variable payments on the Company’s leases were $ 13.9 billion, $ 14.9 billion and $ 12.9 billion for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company made $ 1.9 billion, $ 1.8 billion and $ 1.4 billion of fixed cash payments related to operating leases in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Noncash activities involving right-of-use (“ROU”) assets obtained in exchange for lease liabilities were $ 2.1 billion, $ 2.8 billion and $ 3.3 billion for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The following table shows ROU assets and lease liabilities, and the associated financial statement line items, as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022 (in millions): Lease-Related Assets and Liabilities Financial Statement Line Items 2023 2022 Right-of-use assets: Operating leases Other non-current assets $ 10,661 $ 10,417 Finance leases Property, plant and equipment, net 1,015 952 Total right-of-use assets $ 11,676 $ 11,369 Lease liabilities: Operating leases Other current liabilities $ 1,410 $ 1,534 Other non-current liabilities 10,408 9,936 Finance leases Other current liabilities 165 129 Other non-current liabilities 859 812 Total lease liabilities $ 12,842 $ 12,411 Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 42 Lease liability maturities as of September 30, 2023, are as follows (in millions): Operating Leases Finance Leases Total 2024 $ 1,719 $ 196 $ 1,915 2025 1,875 151 2,026 2026 1,732 120 1,852 2027 1,351 52 1,403 2028 1,181 34 1,215 Thereafter 5,983 872 6,855 Total undiscounted liabilities 13,841 1,425 15,266 Less: Imputed interest ( 2,023 ) ( 401 ) ( 2,424 ) Total lease liabilities $ 11,818 $ 1,024 $ 12,842 The weighted-average remaining lease term related to the Company’s lease liabilities as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022 was 10.6 years and 10.1 years, respectively. The discount rate related to the Company’s lease liabilities as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022 was 3.0 % and 2.3 %, respectively. The discount rates related to the Company’s lease liabilities are generally based on estimates of the Company’s incremental borrowing rate, as the discount rates implicit in the Company’s leases cannot be readily determined. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had $ 544 million of future payments under additional leases, primarily for corporate facilities and retail space, that had not yet commenced. These leases will commence between 2024 and 2026, with lease terms ranging from 1 year to 21 years.

Additionally, to manage foreign exchange rate risk on certain of its foreign currency–denominated notes, the Company uses cross-currency swaps to effectively convert these notes to U.S. dollar–denominated notes. The effective interest rates for the Notes include the interest on the Notes, amortization of the discount or premium and, if applicable, adjustments related to hedging. The Company recognized $ 3.7 billion, $ 2.8 billion and $ 2.6 billion of interest expense on its term debt for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

The Company’s share repurchase programs do not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. Under the programs, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 44 Shares of Common Stock The following table shows the changes in shares of common stock for 2023, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands): 2023 2022 2021 Common stock outstanding, beginning balances 15,943,425 16,426,786 16,976,763 Common stock repurchased ( 471,419 ) ( 568,589 ) ( 656,340 ) Common stock issued, net of shares withheld for employee taxes 78,055 85,228 106,363 Common stock outstanding, ending balances 15,550,061 15,943,425 16,426,786 Note 11 – Share-Based Compensation 2022 Employee Stock Plan The Apple Inc. 2022 Employee Stock Plan (the “2022 Plan”) is a shareholder-approved plan that provides for broad-based equity grants to employees, including executive officers, and permits the granting of RSUs, stock grants, performance-based awards, stock options and stock appreciation rights. RSUs granted under the 2022 Plan generally vest over four years , based on continued employment, and are settled upon vesting in shares of the Company’s common stock on a one -for-one basis. All RSUs granted under the 2022 Plan have dividend equivalent rights, which entitle holders of RSUs to the same dividend value per share as holders of common stock. A maximum of approximately 1.3 billion shares were authorized for issuance pursuant to 2022 Plan awards at the time the plan was approved on March 4, 2022. 2014 Employee Stock Plan The Apple Inc. 2014 Employee Stock Plan (the “2014 Plan”) is a shareholder-approved plan that provided for broad-based equity grants to employees, including executive officers. The 2014 Plan permitted the granting of substantially the same types of equity awards with substantially the same terms as the 2022 Plan. The 2014 Plan also permitted the granting of cash bonus awards. In the third quarter of 2022, the Company terminated the authority to grant new awards under the 2014 Plan. Restricted Stock Units A summary of the Company’s RSU activity and related information for 2023, 2022 and 2021, is as follows: Number of RSUs (in thousands) Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value Per RSU Aggregate Fair Value (in millions) Balance as of September 26, 2020 310,778 $ 51.58 RSUs granted 89,363 $ 116.33 RSUs vested ( 145,766 ) $ 50.71 RSUs canceled ( 13,948 ) $ 68.95 Balance as of September 25, 2021 240,427 $ 75.16 RSUs granted 91,674 $ 150.70 RSUs vested ( 115,861 ) $ 72.12 RSUs canceled ( 14,739 ) $ 99.77 Balance as of September 24, 2022 201,501 $ 109.48 RSUs granted 88,768 $ 150.87 RSUs vested ( 101,878 ) $ 97.31 RSUs canceled ( 8,144 ) $ 127.98 Balance as of September 30, 2023 180,247 $ 135.91 $ 30,860 The fair value as of the respective vesting dates of RSUs was $ 15.9 billion, $ 18.2 billion and $ 19.0 billion for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The majority of RSUs that vested in 2023, 2022 and 2021 were net share settled such that the Company withheld shares with a value equivalent to the employees’ obligation for the applicable income and other employment taxes, and remitted the cash to the appropriate taxing authorities. The total shares withheld were approximately 37 million, 41 million and 53 million for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and were based on the value of the RSUs on their respective vesting dates as determined by the Company’s closing stock price. Total payments to taxing authorities for employees’ tax obligations were $ 5.6 billion, $ 6.4 billion and $ 6.8 billion in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 45 Share-Based Compensation The following table shows share-based compensation expense and the related income tax benefit included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for 2023, 2022 and 2021 (in millions): 2023 2022 2021 Share-based compensation expense $ 10,833 $ 9,038 $ 7,906 Income tax benefit related to share-based compensation expense $ ( 3,421 ) $ ( 4,002 ) $ ( 4,056 ) As of September 30, 2023, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding RSUs was $ 18.6 billion, which the Company expects to recognize over a weighted-average period of 2.5 years. Note 12 – Commitments, Contingencies and Supply Concentrations Unconditional Purchase Obligations The Company has entered into certain off–balance sheet commitments that require the future purchase of goods or services (“unconditional purchase obligations”). The Company’s unconditional purchase obligations primarily consist of supplier arrangements, licensed intellectual property and content, and distribution rights. Future payments under noncancelable unconditional purchase obligations with a remaining term in excess of one year as of September 30, 2023, are as follows (in millions): 2024 $ 4,258 2025 2,674 2026 3,434 2027 1,277 2028 5,878 Thereafter 3,215 Total $ 20,736 Contingencies The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully resolved. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims. Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product Although most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements. Substantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 46 Note 13 – Segment Information and Geographic Data The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. The Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company’s retail stores located in those geographic locations. Operating income for each segment consists of net sales to third parties, related cost of sales, and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. The information provided to the Company’s chief operating decision maker for purposes of making decisions and assessing segment performance excludes asset information. The following table shows information by reportable segment for 2023, 2022 and 2021 (in millions): 2023 2022 2021 Americas: Net sales $ 162,560 $ 169,658 $ 153,306 Operating income $ 60,508 $ 62,683 $ 53,382 Europe: Net sales $ 94,294 $ 95,118 $ 89,307 Operating income $ 36,098 $ 35,233 $ 32,505 Greater China: Net sales $ 72,559 $ 74,200 $ 68,366 Operating income $ 30,328 $ 31,153 $ 28,504 Japan: Net sales $ 24,257 $ 25,977 $ 28,482 Operating income $ 11,888 $ 12,257 $ 12,798 Rest of Asia Pacific: Net sales $ 29,615 $ 29,375 $ 26,356 Operating income $ 12,066 $ 11,569 $ 9,817 A reconciliation of the Company’s segment operating income to the Consolidated Statements of Operations for 2023, 2022 and 2021 is as follows (in millions): 2023 2022 2021 Segment operating income $ 150,888 $ 152,895 $ 137,006 Research and development expense ( 29,915 ) ( 26,251 ) ( 21,914 ) Other corporate expenses, net (1) ( 6,672 ) ( 7,207 ) ( 6,143 ) Total operating income $ 114,301 $ 119,437 $ 108,949 (1) Includes corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, various nonrecurring charges, and other separately managed general and administrative costs.

Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 48 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Apple Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Apple Inc. as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Apple Inc. at September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the “PCAOB”), Apple Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated November 2, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of Apple Inc.’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Apple Inc.’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Apple Inc. in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates. Uncertain Tax Positions Description of the Matter As discussed in Note 7 to the financial statements, Apple Inc. is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and many state and foreign jurisdictions. As of September 30, 2023, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $ 19.5 billion, of which $ 9.5 billion, if recognized, would impact Apple Inc.’s effective tax rate. In accounting for some of the uncertain tax positions, Apple Inc. uses significant judgment in the interpretation and application of complex domestic and international tax laws. Auditing management’s evaluation of whether an uncertain tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and the measurement of the benefit of various tax positions can be complex, involves significant judgment, and is based on interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 49 How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We tested controls relating to the evaluation of uncertain tax positions, including controls over management’s assessment as to whether tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained, management’s process to measure the benefit of its tax positions, and the development of the related disclosures. To evaluate Apple Inc.’s assessment of which tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained, our audit procedures included, among others, reading and evaluating management’s assumptions and analysis, and, as applicable, Apple Inc.’s communications with taxing authorities, that detailed the basis and technical merits of the uncertain tax positions. We involved our tax subject matter resources in assessing the technical merits of certain of Apple Inc.’s tax positions based on our knowledge of relevant tax laws and experience with related taxing authorities. For certain tax positions, we also received external legal counsel confirmation letters and discussed the matters with external advisors and Apple Inc. tax personnel. In addition, we evaluated Apple Inc.’s disclosure in relation to these matters included in Note 7 to the financial statements. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP We have served as Apple Inc.’s auditor since 2009. San Jose, California November 2, 2023 Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 50 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Apple Inc. Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have audited Apple Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the “COSO criteria”). In our opinion, Apple Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the “PCAOB”), the consolidated balance sheets of Apple Inc. as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023, and the related notes and our report dated November 2, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion Apple Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Apple Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Apple Inc. in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP San Jose, California November 2, 2023 Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 51 Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure None. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act were effective as of September 30, 2023 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Inherent Limitations over Internal Controls The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company’s assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that the Company’s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company’s management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company’s internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on the Company’s assessment, management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2023 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, which appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2023, which were identified in connection with management’s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Unless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Company’s fiscal calendar, and references to particular years, quarters, months or periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Each of the terms the “Company” and “Apple” as used herein refers collectively to Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, unless otherwise stated. PART I Item 1.

Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 1 Services Advertising The Company’s advertising services include various third-party licensing arrangements and the Company’s own advertising platforms. AppleCare The Company offers a portfolio of fee-based service and support products under the AppleCare ® brand. The offerings provide priority access to Apple technical support, access to the global Apple authorized service network for repair and replacement services, and in many cases additional coverage for instances of accidental damage and/or theft and loss, depending on the country and type of product. Cloud Services The Company’s cloud services store and keep customers’ content up-to-date and available across multiple Apple devices and Windows personal computers. Digital Content The Company operates various platforms, including the App Store ® , that allow customers to discover and download applications and digital content, such as books, music, video, games and podcasts. The Company also offers digital content through subscription-based services, including Apple Arcade ® , a game subscription service; Apple Fitness+ SM , a personalized fitness service; Apple Music ® , which offers users a curated listening experience with on-demand radio stations; Apple News+ ® , a subscription news and magazine service; and Apple TV+ ® , which offers exclusive original content and live sports. Payment Services The Company offers payment services, including Apple Card ® , a co-branded credit card, and Apple Pay ® , a cashless payment service. Markets and Distribution The Company’s customers are primarily in the consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise and government markets. The Company sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. The Company also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels, such as third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. During 2022, the Company’s net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 38% and 62%, respectively, of total net sales. Competition The markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive, and are characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. Many of the Company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company’s products and infringing on its intellectual property. The Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service features (including security features), relative price and performance, product and service quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and accessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, and corporate reputation. Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 2 The Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories, and services. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software, and service offerings with large customer bases. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company’s services compete with business models that provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company’s product features and applications within their products, or collaborate to offer integrated solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. Supply of Components Although most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements. The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Substantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia, with some Mac computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland. Research and Development Because the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through research and development (“R&D”), licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology. Intellectual Property The Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices, accessories, software and services. This includes patents, designs, copyrights, trademarks and other forms of intellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although the Company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in differentiating its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel. The Company regularly files patent, design, copyright and trademark applications to protect innovations arising from its research, development, design and marketing, and is currently pursuing thousands of applications around the world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued and registered intellectual property rights around the world. No single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company’s products and services. The Company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products and services. In addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the Company’s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of the Company’s products, processes and services. While the Company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all. Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 3 Business Seasonality and Product Introductions The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction. Human Capital The Company believes it has a talented, motivated and dedicated team, and works to create an inclusive, safe and supportive environment for all of its team members. As of September 24, 2022, the Company had approximately 164,000 full-time equivalent employees. Workplace Practices and Policies The Company is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion and diversity and to providing a workplace free of harassment or discrimination. Compensation and Benefits The Company believes that compensation should be competitive and equitable, and should enable employees to share in the Company’s success. The Company recognizes its people are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their needs and the time and support to succeed in their professional and personal lives. In support of this, the Company offers a wide variety of benefits for employees around the world and invests in tools and resources that are designed to support employees’ individual growth and development. Inclusion and Diversity The Company remains committed to its vision to build and sustain a more inclusive workforce that is representative of the communities it serves. The Company continues to work to increase diverse representation at every level, foster an inclusive culture, and support equitable pay and access to opportunity for all employees. Engagement The Company believes that open and honest communication among team members, managers and leaders helps create an open, collaborative work environment where everyone can contribute, grow and succeed. Team members are encouraged to come to their managers with questions, feedback or concerns, and the Company conducts surveys that gauge employee sentiment in areas like career development, manager performance and inclusivity. Health and Safety The Company is committed to protecting its team members everywhere it operates. The Company identifies potential workplace risks in order to develop measures to mitigate possible hazards. The Company supports employees with general safety, security and crisis management training, and by putting specific programs in place for those working in potentially high-hazard environments. Additionally, the Company works to protect the safety and security of its team members, visitors and customers through its global security team. The Company has also taken additional health and safety measures during the COVID-19 pandemic. Available Information The Company’s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to reports filed pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), are filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).

Further, the Company’s references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only. Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 4 Item 1A. Risk Factors The Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described below. When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely affected. Because of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company’s results of operations and financial condition, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. This discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. This section should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K. Macroeconomic and Industry Risks The Company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’s total net sales. In addition, the Company’s global supply chain is large and complex and a majority of the Company’s supplier facilities, including manufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the U.S. As a result, the Company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions. Adverse macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, slower growth or recession, new or increased tariffs and other barriers to trade, changes to fiscal and monetary policy, tighter credit, higher interest rates, high unemployment and currency fluctuations can adversely impact consumer confidence and spending and materially adversely affect demand for the Company’s products and services. In addition, consumer confidence and spending can be materially adversely affected in response to financial market volatility, negative financial news, conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets, declines in income or asset values, energy shortages and cost increases, labor and healthcare costs and other economic factors. In addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company’s products, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic conditions can have a significant impact on the Company’s suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners. Potential effects include financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance operations and purchases of the Company’s products; and insolvency. A downturn in the economic environment can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company’s trade receivables; the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the Company’s ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair value of the Company’s financial instruments. These and other economic factors can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. The Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price have been adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 has had, and continues to have, a significant impact around the world, prompting governments and businesses to take unprecedented measures in response. Such measures have included restrictions on travel and business operations, temporary closures of businesses, and quarantine and shelter-in-place orders. The COVID-19 pandemic has at times significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets. The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have adversely affected and could in the future materially adversely impact the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. During the course of the pandemic, certain of the Company’s component suppliers and manufacturing and logistical service providers have experienced disruptions, resulting in supply shortages that affected sales worldwide, and similar disruptions could occur in the future. Public safety measures can also adversely impact consumer demand for the Company’s products and services in affected areas. Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 5 The Company continues to monitor the situation and take appropriate actions in accordance with the recommendations and requirements of relevant authorities. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact the Company’s operational and financial performance remains uncertain and will depend on many factors outside the Company’s control, including the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic, the emergence of new variants, the development, availability, distribution and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products and services. Additional future impacts on the Company may include material adverse effects on demand for the Company’s products and services, the Company’s supply chain and sales and distribution channels, the Company’s ability to execute its strategic plans, and the Company’s profitability and cost structure. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. The Company’s business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions. Political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners. The Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’s total net sales, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia, including China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Trade policies and disputes and other international conflicts can result in tariffs, sanctions and other measures that restrict international trade, and can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, particularly if these measures occur in regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations. For example, tensions between the U.S. and China have led to a series of tariffs being imposed by the U.S. on imports from China mainland, as well as other business restrictions. Tariffs increase the cost of the Company’s products and the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs can adversely impact the gross margin that the Company earns on its products. Tariffs can also make the Company’s products more expensive for customers, which could make the Company’s products less competitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also adopt other measures, such as controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, that could adversely impact the Company’s operations and supply chain and limit the Company’s ability to offer its products and services as designed. These measures can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers, restructuring business relationships, and ceasing to offer third-party applications on its platforms. Changing the Company’s operations in accordance with new or changed trade restrictions can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company’s operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. If disputes and conflicts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in response could be significantly more severe and restrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company’s business. Political uncertainty surrounding trade and other international disputes could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company’s business. Many of the Company’s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company’s suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company’s control. Global climate change is resulting in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Such events can make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company’s supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company’s service offerings. Following an interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company. Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 6 The Company’s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While the Company’s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to the Company’s business, and harm to the Company’s reputation. Major public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the future materially adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products; the imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement of products between regions; and disruptions in the Company’s supply chain and sales and distribution channels, resulting in interruptions of the supply of current products and delays in production ramps of new products. While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise. Global markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets. The Company’s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. The Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in R&D. There can be no assurance these investments will achieve expected returns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully. The Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to register, additional patents, trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company’s products and infringing on its intellectual property. Effective intellectual property protection is not consistently available in every country in which the Company operates. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the Company’s intellectual property, the Company’s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be materially adversely affected. The Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. Some of the markets in which the Company competes have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall. Additionally, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company’s product features and applications within their products or collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the Company’s approach to providing components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions. The Company’s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition depend substantially on the Company’s ability to continually improve its products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively. Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 7 Business Risks To remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services. Due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the markets and industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services, and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services. The success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors, including timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company’s ability to manage the risks associated with production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for the Company’s products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies. There can be no assurance the Company will successfully manage future introductions and transitions of products and services. The Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of which are located outside of the U.S. Substantially all of the Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia, including China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam, and a significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Changes or additions to the Company’s supply chain require considerable time and resources and involve significant risks and uncertainties. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements can lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company’s direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished control has from time to time and may in the future have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products manufactured or services provided, or adversely affect the Company’s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product defects and experiences unanticipated product defect liabilities from time to time. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, violations of the supplier code of conduct occur from time to time and can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. The Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many components, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company’s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can have a negative impact on the Company’s cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, armed conflict, economic, business, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, or international trade disputes. The Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be reduced or terminated, and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted. Future operating results depend upon the Company’s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms. Because the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the global semiconductor industry is experiencing high demand and shortages of supply, which has adversely affected, and could materially adversely affect, the Company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components and products on commercially reasonable terms or at all. While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The effects of global or regional economic conditions on the Company’s suppliers, described in “ The Company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition, ” above, can also affect the Company’s ability to obtain components . Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition. Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 8 The Company’s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements. When the Company’s supply of components for a new or existing product has been delayed or constrained, or when an outsourcing partner has delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company’s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. The Company’s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the Company’s business and result in harm to the Company’s reputation. The Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the Company, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products. Defects can also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects could make the Company’s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the Company’s products are introduced into specialized applications, including health. In addition, the Company’s service offerings can have quality issues and from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, the Company’s services from time to time have not performed as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software and services it offers. Failure to do so can result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the Company’s products and services. In addition, the Company can be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property, plant and equipment, and/or intangible assets, and significant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems can also adversely affect the experience for users of the Company’s products and services, and result in harm to the Company’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales. The Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk. The Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers’ facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable, there can be no assurance the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes. The Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. Manufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company’s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for periods up to 150 days. Because the Company’s markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments. The Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The Company’s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties, which requires licenses from those third parties. In addition, because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company currently competes or in the future may compete, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, the Company’s products and services can unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Based on experience and industry practice, the Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, can preclude the Company from selling certain products or services, or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 9 The Company’s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers. The Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications and services. There can be no assurance third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the Company’s products. If third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company’s products, customers may choose not to buy the Company’s products. The Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers’ perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the Company’s products compared to competitors’ platforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets, Windows for personal computers and tablets, and PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for gaming platforms. This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of product sales, and the costs of developing such applications and services. The Company’s minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets can make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company’s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors’ products with larger market share. When developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company’s devices can suffer. The Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products. The Company’s products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and when third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, their applications can fail to take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences and can operate incorrectly and can result in dissatisfied customers. The Company distributes third-party applications for its products through the App Store. For the vast majority of applications, developers keep all of the revenue they generate on the App Store. The Company only retains a commission from sales of applications and sales of digital services or goods within an application. From time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to competition, market and legal conditions. The Company may make further business changes in the future. New legislative initiatives, such as the European Union (“EU”) Digital Markets Act, could require further changes. The Company is also subject to litigation and investigations relating to the App Store, which have resulted in changes to the Company’s business practices, and may in the future result in further changes. These changes could include how and to what extent the Company charges developers for access to its platforms and manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store. This could reduce the volume of sales, and the commission that the Company earns on those sales, would decrease. If the rate of the commission that the Company retains on such sales is reduced, or if it is otherwise narrowed in scope or eliminated, the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Failure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the Company’s customers, or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell, or offer subscriptions to, third-party content, as well as the right to incorporate specific content into the Company’s own services. The licensing or other distribution arrangements for this content can be for relatively short time periods and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and can take actions to make it difficult or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company’s access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules. The Company also produces its own digital content, which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing competition for talent, content and subscribers, and may fail to appeal to the Company’s customers. The COVID-19 pandemic has also caused additional restrictions on production and increased costs for digital content. Some third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. If requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner. Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 10 The Company’s success depends largely on the talents and efforts of its team members, the continued service and availability of highly skilled employees, including key personnel, and the Company’s ability to nurture its distinctive and inclusive culture. Much of the Company’s future success depends on the talents and efforts of its team members, the continued availability and service of key personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly skilled employees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley, where most of the Company’s key personnel are located. In addition to intense competition for talent, workforce dynamics are constantly evolving. If the Company does not manage changing workforce dynamics effectively, it could materially adversely affect the Company’s culture, reputation and operational flexibility. The Company believes that its distinctive and inclusive culture is a significant driver of its success. If the Company is unable to nurture its culture, it could materially adversely affect the Company’s ability to recruit and retain the highly skilled employees who are critical to its success, and could otherwise materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. The Company depends on the performance of carriers, wholesalers, retailers and other resellers. The Company distributes its products and certain of its services through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers, many of which distribute products and services from competitors. The Company also sells its products and services and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. Some carriers providing cellular network service for the Company’s products offer financing, installment payment plans or subsidies for users’ purchases of the device. There can be no assurance such offers will be continued at all or in the same amounts. The Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers’ stores with Company employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays. These programs can require a substantial investment while not assuring return or incremental sales. The financial condition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Company’s products, or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the Company’s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company’s products. The Company’s business and reputation are impacted by information technology system failures and network disruptions. The Company and its global supply chain are exposed to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, ransomware or other cybersecurity incidents, or other events or disruptions. System redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company’s or its vendors’ business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions can adversely impact the Company’s business by, among other things, preventing access to the Company’s online services, interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the Company’s products. These events could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. Losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personal information, could subject the Company to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences. The Company’s business requires it to use and store confidential information, including personal information, with respect to the Company’s customers and employees. The Company devotes significant resources to network and data security, including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data. But these measures cannot provide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. The Company’s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties. The Company relies on global suppliers that are also exposed to ransomware and other malicious attacks that can disrupt business operations. Although the Company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to or accessible by third parties working on the Company’s behalf, such measures are not always effective and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur. Such incidents and other malicious attacks could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 11 The Company experiences malicious attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to its systems on a regular basis. These attacks seek to compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential information or disrupt normal business operations, and could, among other things, impair the Company’s ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services, impact the Company’s stock price, materially damage commercial relationships, and expose the Company to litigation or government investigations, which could result in penalties, fines or judgments against the Company. Globally, attacks are expected to continue accelerating in both frequency and sophistication with increasing use by actors of tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent controls, avoid detection, and remove or obfuscate forensic evidence, all of which hinders the Company’s ability to identify, investigate and recover from incidents. In addition, attacks against the Company and its customers can escalate during periods of severe diplomatic or armed conflict. Although malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information, including personal information, affect many companies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and processes. The Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data, and mitigate the impact of unauthorized access, including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies. As with all companies, these security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking, ransomware attacks, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty password management or other irregularities. For example, third parties can fraudulently induce the Company’s or its vendors’ employees or customers into disclosing user names, passwords or other sensitive information, which can, in turn, be used for unauthorized access to the Company’s or its vendors’ systems and services. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company deploys and makes available technologies like multifactor authentication, monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, can result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the Company’s products and services. While the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise. Investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company’s ongoing business, present risks not originally contemplated and materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. The Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater-than-expected liabilities and expenses, economic, political, legal and regulatory challenges associated with operating in new businesses, regions or countries, inadequate return on capital, potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets, and significant write-offs. Investment and acquisition transactions are exposed to additional risks, including failing to obtain required regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all, or the imposition of onerous conditions that could delay or prevent the Company from completing a transaction or otherwise limit the Company’s ability to fully realize the anticipated benefits of a transaction. These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful. The failure of any significant investment could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. The Company’s retail stores have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. The Company’s retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory and personnel. The Company also has entered into substantial lease commitments for retail space. Certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than the Company’s more typical retail stores. Due to the high cost structure associated with the Company’s retail stores, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of an individual store or multiple stores, including as a result of protective public safety measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance costs. The Company’s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition, including macro-economic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity. Other factors include the Company’s ability to: manage costs associated with retail store construction and operation; manage relationships with existing retail partners; manage costs associated with fluctuations in the value of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost. Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 12 Legal and Regulatory Compliance Risks The Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings or government investigations. The Company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved, and new matters may arise in the future. In addition, agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which can subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. The number of claims, legal proceedings and government investigations involving the Company, and the alleged magnitude of such claims, proceedings and government investigations, has generally increased over time and may continue to increase. The Company has faced and continues to face a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled products, and new claims may arise in the future. For example, technology and other patent-holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in several U.S. jurisdictions, as well as internationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages. Regardless of the merit of particular claims, defending against litigation or responding to government investigations can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company’s operations. In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such challenges. There can be no assurance such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These agreements can also significantly increase the Company’s cost of sales and operating expenses and require the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company’s ability to offer certain products and services. Except as described in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading “Legal Proceedings” and in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, “Commitments and Contingencies” under the heading “Contingencies,” in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims. The outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s results of operations and financial condition for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome can result in significant compensatory, punitive or trebled monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company, and can require the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company’s ability to offer certain products and services, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise. The Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects on the Company’s business. The Company’s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects, including antitrust; privacy, data security and data localization; consumer protection; advertising, sales, billing and e-commerce; financial services and technology; product liability; intellectual property ownership and infringement; digital platforms; internet, telecommunications, and mobile communications; media, television, film and digital content; availability of third-party software applications and services; labor and employment; anticorruption; import, export and trade; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; anti–money laundering; foreign ownership and investment; tax; and environmental, health and safety, including electronic waste, recycling, and climate change. Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 13 Compliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive. New and changing laws and regulations can adversely affect the Company’s business by increasing the Company’s costs, limiting the Company’s ability to offer a product, service or feature to customers, impacting customer demand for the Company’s products and services, and requiring changes to the Company’s supply chain and its business. New and changing laws and regulations can also create uncertainty about how such laws and regulations will be interpreted and applied. These risks and costs may increase as the Company’s products and services are introduced into specialized applications, including health and financial services. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance the Company’s employees, contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company’s policies and procedures. If the Company is found to have violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. Regulatory changes and other actions that materially adversely affect the Company’s business may be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, the Company is subject to changing regulations relating to the export and import of its products. Although the Company has programs, policies and procedures in place that are designed to satisfy regulatory requirements, there can be no assurance that such policies and procedures will be effective in preventing a violation or a claim of a violation. As a result, the Company’s products could be delayed or prohibited from importation, either of which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. Expectations relating to environmental, social and governance considerations expose the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs, reputational harm, and other adverse effects on the Company’s business. Many governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental, social and governance considerations relating to businesses, including climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, human and civil rights, and diversity, equity and inclusion. In addition, the Company makes statements about its environmental, social and governance goals and initiatives through its environmental, social and governance report, its other non-financial reports, information provided on its website, press statements and other communications. Responding to these environmental, social and governance considerations and implementation of these goals and initiatives involves risks and uncertainties, requires investments, and depends in part on third-party performance or data that is outside the Company’s control. The Company cannot guarantee that it will achieve its announced environmental, social and governance goals and initiatives. In addition, some stakeholders may disagree with the Company’s goals and initiatives. Any failure, or perceived failure, by the Company to achieve its goals, further its initiatives, adhere to its public statements, comply with federal, state or international environmental, social and governance laws and regulations, or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could result in legal and regulatory proceedings against the Company and materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. The technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and regulatory scrutiny, which exposes the Company to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions and penalties. From time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to competition, market and legal conditions. The Company may make further business changes in the future. New legislative initiatives, such as the EU Digital Markets Act, or similar laws in other jurisdictions, could require further changes. These changes could include how and to what extent the Company charges developers for access to its platforms and manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store. The Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations in various jurisdictions around the world, which can result in legal proceedings and claims against the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company is the subject of investigations in Europe and other jurisdictions relating to App Store terms and conditions. If such investigations result in adverse findings against the Company, the Company could be exposed to significant fines and may be required to make changes to its App Store business, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company is also subject to litigation relating to the App Store, which has resulted in changes to the Company’s business practices, and may in the future result in further changes. Further, the Company has commercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that are or may become subject to investigations and litigation that, if resolved against those other companies, could materially adversely affect the Company’s commercial relationships with those business partners and materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company earns revenue from licensing arrangements with other companies to offer their search services on the Company’s platforms and apps, and certain of these arrangements are currently subject to government investigations and legal proceedings. Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 14 There can be no assurance the Company’s business will not be materially adversely affected, individually or in the aggregate, by the outcomes of such investigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future. Changes to the Company’s business practices to comply with new laws and regulations or in connection with other legal proceedings could negatively impact the reputation of the Company’s products for privacy and security and otherwise adversely affect the experience for users of the Company’s products and services, and result in harm to the Company’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, and lost sales. The Company’s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding data protection. The Company is subject to federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of various types of personal information. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also restrict transfers of personal information among the Company and its international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and additional jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions or have laws that are pending. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing requirements causes the Company to incur substantial costs and has required and may in the future require the Company to change its business practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability. The Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of personal information through its privacy policy, information provided on its website, press statements and other privacy notices provided to customers. Any failure by the Company to comply with these public statements or with other federal, state or international privacy or data protection laws and regulations could result in inquiries or proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. In addition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability. In addition to the risks generally relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal information, the Company is also subject to specific obligations relating to information considered sensitive under applicable laws, such as health data, financial data and biometric data. Health data and financial data are subject to additional privacy, security and breach notification requirements, and the Company is subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the Company’s compliance with these obligations. If the Company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements, or if health data or financial data is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the Company’s agreements with healthcare or financial institutions, the Company can be subject to litigation or government investigations, and can be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and can also incur significant fees or fines. Payment card data is also subject to additional requirements. Under payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder information is potentially compromised, the Company can be liable for associated investigatory expenses and can also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards. The Company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards, which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. Financial Risks The Company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate. The Company’s profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For example, the gross margins on the Company’s products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The Company’s gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in response to such pressures; increased competition; the Company’s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering content for the Company’s services; the Company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that regulatory changes require the Company to modify its product and service offerings; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; inflation and other macroeconomic pressures; and the introduction of new products or services, including new products or services with higher cost structures. These and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition. The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company’s products or services, issues with new product or service introductions, information technology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company’s logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners. Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 15 The Company’s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies. The Company’s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non–U.S. dollar–denominated sales, cost of sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company’s products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company’s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar’s strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency–denominated sales. Conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Company’s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins. The Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place. The Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio. The Company’s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and economic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition. The Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen. The Company distributes its products and certain of its services through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. The Company also sells its products and services directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the Company’s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant portion of the Company’s trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers. The Company’s exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September 24, 2022, the Company’s vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses. The Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and exposure to additional tax liabilities. The Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland, where a number of the Company’s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws and tax rates for income taxes and other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. The Company’s effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including in the U.S. and Ireland. The application of tax laws may be uncertain, require significant judgment and be subject to differing interpretations. Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 16 The Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company’s effective tax rates were to increase, particularly in the U.S. or Ireland, or if the ultimate determination of the Company’s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. General Risks The price of the Company’s stock is subject to volatility. The Company’s stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, the Company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have, from time to time, experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies’ operating performance. Price volatility may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its stock in a given period to exceed the stock’s price at a given point in time. The Company believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability. The Company also believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow, and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Company’s Board of Directors, and the Company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, the price of the Company’s stock may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. Item 2. Properties The Company’s headquarters are located in Cupertino, California. As of September 24, 2022, the Company owned or leased facilities and land for corporate functions, R&D, data centers, retail and other purposes at locations throughout the U.S. and in various places outside the U.S. The Company believes its existing facilities and equipment, which are used by all reportable segments, are in good operating condition and are suitable for the conduct of its business. Item 3. Legal Proceedings Epic Games Epic Games, Inc. (“Epic”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the “Northern California District Court”) against the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California’s unfair competition law based upon the Company’s operation of its App Store. The Company filed a counterclaim for breach of contract. On September 10, 2021, the Northern California District Court ruled in favor of the Company with respect to nine out of the ten counts included in Epic’s claim, and in favor of the Company with respect to the Company’s claims for breach of contract. The Northern California District Court found that certain provisions of the Company’s App Store Review Guidelines violate California’s unfair competition law and issued an injunction. Epic appealed the decision. The Company filed a cross-appeal and has been granted a stay pending the appeal. Other Legal Proceedings The Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the fourth quarter of 2022 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This section of this Form 10-K generally discusses 2022 and 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021. Discussions of 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020 are not included in this Form 10-K, and can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 25, 2021. Fiscal Year Highlights Fiscal 2022 Highlights Total net sales increased 8% or $28.5 billion during 2022 compared to 2021, driven primarily by higher net sales of iPhone, Services and Mac. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable year-over-year impact on all Products and Services net sales during 2022. The Company announces new product, service and software offerings at various times during the year. Significant announcements during fiscal 2022 included the following: First Quarter 2022: • Updated MacBook Pro 14” and MacBook Pro 16”, powered by the Apple M1 Pro or M1 Max chip; and • Third generation of AirPods. Second Quarter 2022: • Updated iPhone SE with 5G technology; • All-new Mac Studio, powered by the Apple M1 Max or M1 Ultra chip; • All-new Studio Display™; and • Updated iPad Air with 5G technology, powered by the Apple M1 chip. Third Quarter 2022: • Updated MacBook Air and MacBook Pro 13”, both powered by the Apple M2 chip; • iOS 16, macOS Ventura, iPadOS 16 and watchOS 9, updates to the Company’s operating systems; and • Apple Pay Later, a buy now, pay later service. Fourth Quarter 2022: • iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max; • Second generation of AirPods Pro; and • Apple Watch Series 8, updated Apple Watch SE and all-new Apple Watch Ultra. In April 2022, the Company announced an increase to its Program authorization from $315 billion to $405 billion and raised its quarterly dividend from $0.22 to $0.23 per share beginning in May 2022. During 2022, the Company repurchased $90.2 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $14.8 billion. COVID-19 The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and continues to have, a significant impact around the world, prompting governments and businesses to take unprecedented measures, such as restrictions on travel and business operations, temporary closures of businesses, and quarantine and shelter-in-place orders. The COVID-19 pandemic has at times significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets. The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have affected and could in the future materially impact the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. Certain of the Company’s outsourcing partners, component suppliers and logistical service providers have experienced disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in supply shortages. Similar disruptions could occur in the future. Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 20 Products and Services Performance The following table shows net sales by category for 2022, 2021 and 2020 (dollars in millions): 2022 Change 2021 Change 2020 Net sales by category: iPhone (1) $ 205,489 7 % $ 191,973 39 % $ 137,781 Mac (1) 40,177 14 % 35,190 23 % 28,622 iPad (1) 29,292 (8) % 31,862 34 % 23,724 Wearables, Home and Accessories (1)(2) 41,241 7 % 38,367 25 % 30,620 Services (3) 78,129 14 % 68,425 27 % 53,768 Total net sales $ 394,328 8 % $ 365,817 33 % $ 274,515 (1) Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are bundled in the sales price of the respective product. (2) Wearables, Home and Accessories net sales include sales of AirPods, Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats products, HomePod mini and accessories. (3) Services net sales include sales from the Company’s advertising, AppleCare, cloud, digital content, payment and other services. Services net sales also include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain products. iPhone iPhone net sales increased during 2022 compared to 2021 due primarily to higher net sales from the Company’s new iPhone models released since the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2021. Mac Mac net sales increased during 2022 compared to 2021 due primarily to higher net sales of laptops. iPad iPad net sales decreased during 2022 compared to 2021 due primarily to lower net sales of iPad Pro. Wearables, Home and Accessories Wearables, Home and Accessories net sales increased during 2022 compared to 2021 due primarily to higher net sales of Apple Watch and AirPods. Services Services net sales increased during 2022 compared to 2021 due primarily to higher net sales from advertising, cloud services and the App Store. Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 21 Segment Operating Performance The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. Further information regarding the Company’s reportable segments can be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 11, “Segment Information and Geographic Data.” The following table shows net sales by reportable segment for 2022, 2021 and 2020 (dollars in millions): 2022 Change 2021 Change 2020 Net sales by reportable segment: Americas $ 169,658 11 % $ 153,306 23 % $ 124,556 Europe 95,118 7 % 89,307 30 % 68,640 Greater China 74,200 9 % 68,366 70 % 40,308 Japan 25,977 (9) % 28,482 33 % 21,418 Rest of Asia Pacific 29,375 11 % 26,356 35 % 19,593 Total net sales $ 394,328 8 % $ 365,817 33 % $ 274,515 Americas Americas net sales increased during 2022 compared to 2021 due primarily to higher net sales of iPhone, Services and Mac. Europe Europe net sales increased during 2022 compared to 2021 due primarily to higher net sales of iPhone and Services. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had a net unfavorable year-over-year impact on Europe net sales during 2022. Greater China Greater China net sales increased during 2022 compared to 2021 due primarily to higher net sales of iPhone and Services. The strength of the renminbi relative to the U.S. dollar had a favorable year-over-year impact on Greater China net sales during 2022. Japan Japan net sales decreased during 2022 compared to 2021 due to the weakness of the yen relative to the U.S. dollar. Rest of Asia Pacific Rest of Asia Pacific net sales increased during 2022 compared to 2021 due primarily to higher net sales of iPhone, Mac and Services. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable year-over-year impact on Rest of Asia Pacific net sales during 2022. Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 22 Gross Margin Products and Services gross margin and gross margin percentage for 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows (dollars in millions): 2022 2021 2020 Gross margin: Products $ 114,728 $ 105,126 $ 69,461 Services 56,054 47,710 35,495 Total gross margin $ 170,782 $ 152,836 $ 104,956 Gross margin percentage: Products 36.3 % 35.3 % 31.5 % Services 71.7 % 69.7 % 66.0 % Total gross margin percentage 43.3 % 41.8 % 38.2 % Products Gross Margin Products gross margin increased during 2022 compared to 2021 due primarily to a different Products mix and higher Products volume, partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Products gross margin percentage increased during 2022 compared to 2021 due primarily to a different Products mix, partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Services Gross Margin Services gross margin increased during 2022 compared to 2021 due primarily to higher Services net sales, partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Services gross margin percentage increased during 2022 compared to 2021 due primarily to improved leverage and a different Services mix, partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. The Company’s future gross margins can be impacted by a variety of factors, as discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.” As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and downward pressure. Operating Expenses Operating expenses for 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows (dollars in millions): 2022 Change 2021 Change 2020 Research and development $ 26,251 20 % $ 21,914 17 % $ 18,752 Percentage of total net sales 7 % 6 % 7 % Selling, general and administrative $ 25,094 14 % $ 21,973 10 % $ 19,916 Percentage of total net sales 6 % 6 % 7 % Total operating expenses $ 51,345 17 % $ 43,887 13 % $ 38,668 Percentage of total net sales 13 % 12 % 14 % Research and Development The year-over-year growth in R&D expense in 2022 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses and engineering program costs. Selling, General and Administrative The year-over-year growth in selling, general and administrative expense in 2022 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses, advertising and professional services. Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 23 Other Income/(Expense), Net Other income/(expense), net (“OI&E”) for 2022, 2021 and 2020 was as follows (dollars in millions): 2022 Change 2021 Change 2020 Interest and dividend income $ 2,825 $ 2,843 $ 3,763 Interest expense (2,931) (2,645) (2,873) Other income/(expense), net (228) 60 (87) Total other income/(expense), net $ (334) (229) % $ 258 (68) % $ 803 The decrease in OI&E during 2022 compared to 2021 was due primarily to higher realized losses on debt securities, unfavorable fair value adjustments on equity securities and higher interest expense, partially offset by higher foreign exchange gains. Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows (dollars in millions): 2022 2021 2020 Provision for income taxes $ 19,300 $ 14,527 $ 9,680 Effective tax rate 16.2 % 13.3 % 14.4 % Statutory federal income tax rate 21 % 21 % 21 % The Company’s effective tax rate for 2022 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, tax benefits from share-based compensation and the impact of the U.S. federal R&D credit, partially offset by state income taxes. The Company’s effective tax rate for 2021 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, tax benefits from share-based compensation and foreign-derived intangible income deductions. The Company’s effective tax rate for 2022 was higher compared to 2021 due primarily to a higher effective tax rate on foreign earnings, including the impact to U.S. foreign tax credits as a result of regulatory guidance issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2022, and lower tax benefits from foreign-derived intangible income deductions and share-based compensation. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, which totaled $156.4 billion as of September 24, 2022, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond. The Company’s material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations. Debt As of September 24, 2022, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $111.8 billion (collectively the “Notes”), with $11.1 billion payable within 12 months. Future interest payments associated with the Notes total $41.3 billion, with $2.9 billion payable within 12 months. The Company also issues unsecured short-term promissory notes (“Commercial Paper”) pursuant to a commercial paper program. As of September 24, 2022, the Company had $10.0 billion of Commercial Paper outstanding, all of which was payable within 12 months. Leases The Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including corporate, data center, manufacturing and retail space. As of September 24, 2022, the Company had fixed lease payment obligations of $15.3 billion, with $2.0 billion payable within 12 months. Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 24 Manufacturing Purchase Obligations The Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company’s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. As of September 24, 2022, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $71.1 billion, with $68.4 billion payable within 12 months. The Company’s manufacturing purchase obligations are primarily noncancelable. Other Purchase Obligations The Company’s other purchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including assets related to product manufacturing, and noncancelable obligations related to internet services and content creation. As of September 24, 2022, the Company had other purchase obligations of $17.8 billion, with $6.8 billion payable within 12 months. Deemed Repatriation Tax Payable As of September 24, 2022, the balance of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Act”) was $22.0 billion, with $5.3 billion expected to be paid within 12 months. In addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has a capital return program authorized by the Board of Directors. The Program does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of September 24, 2022, the Company’s quarterly cash dividend was $0.23 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Uncertain Tax Positions The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company’s uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the Act and matters related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company’s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company’s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results. Legal and Other Contingencies The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results. Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 25 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management The Company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps, both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate exposures. Given the effective horizons of the Company’s risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures, there can be no assurance these positions will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates. Further, the recognition of the gains and losses related to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and operating results. Interest Rate Risk The Company’s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company’s investment portfolio and outstanding debt. While the Company is exposed to global interest rate fluctuations, it is most affected by fluctuations in U.S. interest rates. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and the fair value of those securities, as well as costs associated with hedging and interest paid on the Company’s debt. The Company’s investment policy and strategy are focused on the preservation of capital and supporting the Company’s liquidity requirements. The Company uses a combination of internal and external management to execute its investment strategy and achieve its investment objectives. The Company typically invests in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company’s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the Company’s investment portfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $4.0 billion and $4.1 billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio, respectively. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity. As of September 24, 2022, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes and as of September 25, 2021, the Company had outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of $110.1 billion and $118.7 billion, respectively. The Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its outstanding term debt. Interest rate swaps allow the Company to effectively convert fixed-rate payments into floating-rate payments or floating-rate payments into fixed-rate payments. Gains and losses on term debt are generally offset by the corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instrument. A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the Company’s debt as of September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021 to increase by $201 million and $186 million on an annualized basis, respectively. Foreign Currency Risk In general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company’s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is a risk that the Company will have to adjust local currency pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. In addition, the Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on its foreign currency–denominated debt issuances. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 26 To provide an assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the Company’s foreign currency derivative positions, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk (“VAR”) model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model consisted of using a Monte Carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company’s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $1.0 billion as of September 24, 2022, compared to a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $550 million as of September 25, 2021. Because the Company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, the losses in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures. Actual future gains and losses associated with the Company’s investment portfolio, debt and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of September 24, 2022 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and the Company’s actual exposures and positions.

Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 33 Apple Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation and Preparation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively “Apple” or the “Company”). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation. The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which will occur in the first quarter of the Company’s fiscal year ending September 30, 2023. The Company’s fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020 spanned 52 weeks each. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Revenue Recognition Net sales consist of revenue from the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad, Services and other products. The Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is transferred to its customers. Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company’s Products net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company’s Services net sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable. The Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer incentive programs based on the Company’s expectations and historical experience. For arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the Company allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (“SSPs”). When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are established that reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company’s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation. The Company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud ® , Siri ® and Maps. The third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company’s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided. Cost of sales related to delivered hardware and bundled software, including estimated warranty costs, are recognized at the time of sale. Costs incurred to provide product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights are recognized as cost of sales as incurred. For certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For these arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized revenue, and does not disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services. Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 34 For the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products, including evaluating if it can establish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party applications sold through the App Store and certain digital content sold through the Company’s other digital content stores, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for such sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission it retains. The Company records revenue net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities, with the collected taxes recorded within other current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority. Share-Based Compensation The Company generally measures share-based compensation based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant, and recognizes expense on a straight-line basis for its estimate of equity awards that will ultimately vest. Further information regarding share-based compensation can be found in Note 9, “Benefit Plans.” Earnings Per Share The following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for 2022, 2021 and 2020 (net income in millions and shares in thousands): 2022 2021 2020 Numerator: Net income $ 99,803 $ 94,680 $ 57,411 Denominator: Weighted-average basic shares outstanding 16,215,963 16,701,272 17,352,119 Effect of dilutive securities 109,856 163,647 176,095 Weighted-average diluted shares 16,325,819 16,864,919 17,528,214 Basic earnings per share $ 6.15 $ 5.67 $ 3.31 Diluted earnings per share $ 6.11 $ 5.61 $ 3.28 The Company applies the treasury stock method to determine the dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities. Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents. The Company’s investments in marketable debt securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. The Company classifies its marketable debt securities as either short-term or long-term based on each instrument’s underlying contractual maturity date. The Company’s investments in marketable equity securities are classified based on the nature of the securities and their availability for use in current operations. The cost of securities sold is determined using the specific identification method. Inventories Inventories are measured using the first-in, first-out method. Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 35 Restricted Marketable Securities The Company considers marketable securities to be restricted when withdrawal or general use is legally restricted. The Company reports restricted marketable securities as current or non-current marketable securities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets based on the classification of the underlying securities. Property, Plant and Equipment Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which for buildings is the shorter of 40 years or the remaining life of the building; between one and five years for machinery and equipment, including manufacturing equipment; and the shorter of the lease term or useful life for leasehold improvements. Capitalized costs related to internal-use software are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from five to seven years . Depreciation and amortization expense on property, plant and equipment was $ 8.7 billion, $ 9.5 billion and $ 9.7 billion during 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Derivative Instruments and Hedging All derivative instruments are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The accounting treatment for derivative gains and losses is based on intended use and hedge designation. Gains and losses arising from amounts that are included in the assessment of cash flow hedge effectiveness are initially deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (“AOCI”) and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings, and in the same line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For options designated as cash flow hedges, the Company excludes time value from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognizes it on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge in the Consolidated Statements of Operations line item to which the hedge relates. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in other comprehensive income/(loss) (“OCI”). Gains and losses arising from amounts that are included in the assessment of fair value hedge effectiveness are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations line item to which the hedge relates along with offsetting losses and gains related to the change in value of the hedged item. For foreign exchange forward contracts designated as fair value hedges, the Company excludes the forward carry component from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognizes it in other income/(expense), net (“OI&E”) on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OCI. Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair values of derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations line items to which the derivative instruments relate. The Company presents derivative assets and liabilities at their gross fair values in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company classifies cash flows related to derivative instruments as operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Fair Value Measurements The fair values of the Company’s money market funds and certain marketable equity securities are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. The valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of the Company’s debt instruments and all other financial instruments, which generally have counterparties with high credit ratings, are based on quoted market prices or model-driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data. Income Taxes The Company records certain deferred tax assets and liabilities in connection with the minimum tax on certain foreign earnings created by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Act”). Leases The Company combines and accounts for lease and nonlease components as a single lease component for leases of corporate, data center and retail facilities. The discount rates related to the Company’s lease liabilities are generally based on estimates of the Company’s incremental borrowing rate, as the discount rates implicit in the Company’s leases cannot be readily determined. Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 36 Segment Reporting The Company reports segment information based on the “management” approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company’s reportable segments. The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described elsewhere in this Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.” The Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company’s retail stores located in those geographic locations. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the reportable segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as research and development (“R&D”), corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges and other separately managed general and administrative costs. The Company does not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes. Note 2 – Revenue Net sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows (in millions): 2022 2021 2020 iPhone (1) $ 205,489 $ 191,973 $ 137,781 Mac (1) 40,177 35,190 28,622 iPad (1) 29,292 31,862 23,724 Wearables, Home and Accessories (1)(2) 41,241 38,367 30,620 Services (3) 78,129 68,425 53,768 Total net sales (4) $ 394,328 $ 365,817 $ 274,515 (1) Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are bundled in the sales price of the respective product. (2) Wearables, Home and Accessories net sales include sales of AirPods, Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats products, HomePod mini and accessories. (3) Services net sales include sales from the Company’s advertising, AppleCare, cloud, digital content, payment and other services. Services net sales also include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain products.

Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 38 The following table shows the fair value of the Company’s non-current marketable debt securities, by contractual maturity, as of September 24, 2022 (in millions): Due after 1 year through 5 years $ 87,031 Due after 5 years through 10 years 16,429 Due after 10 years 17,345 Total fair value $ 120,805 Derivative Instruments and Hedging The Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates. Foreign Exchange Risk To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, option contracts or other instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months. To protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of September 24, 2022, the maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term debt–related foreign currency transactions is 20 years. The Company may also enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. Interest Rate Risk To protect the Company’s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. The notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments as of September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021 were as follows (in millions): 2022 2021 Derivative instruments designated as accounting hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ 102,670 $ 76,475 Interest rate contracts $ 20,125 $ 16,875 Derivative instruments not designated as accounting hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ 185,381 $ 126,918 Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 39 The gross fair values of the Company’s derivative assets and liabilities as of September 24, 2022 were as follows (in millions): 2022 Fair Value of Derivatives Designated as Accounting Hedges Fair Value of Derivatives Not Designated as Accounting Hedges Total Fair Value Derivative assets (1) : Foreign exchange contracts $ 4,317 $ 2,819 $ 7,136 Derivative liabilities (2) : Foreign exchange contracts $ 2,205 $ 2,547 $ 4,752 Interest rate contracts $ 1,367 $ — $ 1,367 (1) Derivative assets are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current assets and other non-current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. (2) Derivative liabilities are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The derivative assets above represent the Company’s gross credit exposure if all counterparties failed to perform. To mitigate credit risk, the Company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair values of certain derivatives fluctuate from contractually established thresholds. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to the Company’s derivative contracts, under which the Company is allowed to settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of September 24, 2022, the potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the Company’s derivative contracts, including the effects of collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $ 7.8 billion, resulting in a net derivative asset of $ 412 million. The carrying amounts of the Company’s hedged items in fair value hedges as of September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021 were as follows (in millions): 2022 2021 Hedged assets/(liabilities): Current and non-current marketable securities $ 13,378 $ 15,954 Current and non-current term debt $ ( 18,739 ) $ ( 17,857 ) Accounts Receivable Trade Receivables The Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, resellers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral or third-party credit support in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements. As of September 24, 2022, the Company had one customer that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, which accounted for 10 %. The Company’s cellular network carriers accounted for 44 % and 42 % of total trade receivables as of September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021, respectively. Vendor Non-Trade Receivables The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. As of September 24, 2022, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 54 % and 13 %. As of September 25, 2021, the Company had three vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 52 %, 11 % and 11 %.

Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 42 Uncertain Tax Positions As of September 24, 2022, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $ 16.8 billion, of which $ 8.0 billion, if recognized, would impact the Company’s effective tax rate. As of September 25, 2021, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $ 15.5 billion, of which $ 6.6 billion, if recognized, would have impacted the Company’s effective tax rate. The aggregate change in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which excludes interest and penalties, for 2022, 2021 and 2020, is as follows (in millions): 2022 2021 2020 Beginning balances $ 15,477 $ 16,475 $ 15,619 Increases related to tax positions taken during a prior year 2,284 816 454 Decreases related to tax positions taken during a prior year ( 1,982 ) ( 1,402 ) ( 791 ) Increases related to tax positions taken during the current year 1,936 1,607 1,347 Decreases related to settlements with taxing authorities ( 28 ) ( 1,838 ) ( 85 ) Decreases related to expiration of the statute of limitations ( 929 ) ( 181 ) ( 69 ) Ending balances $ 16,758 $ 15,477 $ 16,475 The Company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and many state and foreign jurisd ictions. Tax years after 2017 for the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and after 2014 in certain major foreign jurisdictions, remain subject to examination. Although the timing of resolution and/or closure of examinations is not certain, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that its gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease in the next 12 months by as much as $ 4.8 billion. European Commission State Aid Decision On August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company (the “State Aid Decision”). The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The recovery amount was calculated to be € 13.1 billion, plus interest of € 1.2 billion. The Company and Ireland appealed the State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the “General Court”). On July 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September 25, 2020, the European Commission appealed the General Court’s decision to the European Court of Justice. The Company believes that any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision would be creditable against U.S. taxes, subject to any foreign tax credit limitations in the Act. On an annual basis, the Company may request approval from the Irish Minister for Finance to reduce the recovery amount for certain taxes paid to other countries. As of September 24, 2022, the adjusted recovery amount was € 12.7 billion, excluding interest. The adjusted recovery amount plus interest is funded into escrow, where it will remain restricted from general use pending the conclusion of all legal proceedings. Refer to the Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities section of Note 3, “Financial Instruments” for more information. Note 6 – Leases The Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including corporate, data center, manufacturing and retail space. These leases typically have original terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multiyear renewal options, some of which are reasonably certain of exercise. Payments under the Company’s lease arrangements may be fixed or variable, and variable lease payments are primarily based on purchases of output of the underlying leased assets. Lease costs associated with fixed payments on the Company’s operating leases were $ 1.9 billion, $ 1.7 billion and $ 1.5 billion for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Lease costs associated with variable payments on the Company’s leases were $ 14.9 billion, $ 12.9 billion and $ 9.3 billion for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Company made $ 1.8 billion, $ 1.4 billion and $ 1.5 billion of fixed cash payments related to operating leases in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Noncash activities involving right-of-use (“ROU”) assets obtained in exchange for lease liabilities were $ 2.8 billion for 2022, $ 3.3 billion for 2021 and $ 10.5 billion for 2020, including the impact of adopting the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) in the first quarter of 2020.

Shares of Common Stock The following table shows the changes in shares of common stock for 2022, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands): 2022 2021 2020 Common stock outstanding, beginning balances 16,426,786 16,976,763 17,772,945 Common stock repurchased ( 568,589 ) ( 656,340 ) ( 917,270 ) Common stock issued, net of shares withheld for employee taxes 85,228 106,363 121,088 Common stock outstanding, ending balances 15,943,425 16,426,786 16,976,763 Note 9 – Benefit Plans 2022 Employee Stock Plan In the second quarter of 2022, shareholders approved the Apple Inc. 2022 Employee Stock Plan (the “2022 Plan”), which provides for broad-based equity grants to employees, including executive officers, and permits the granting of restricted stock units (“RSUs”), stock grants, performance-based awards, stock options and stock appreciation rights. RSUs granted under the 2022 Plan generally vest over four years , based on continued employment, and are settled upon vesting in shares of the Company’s common stock on a one -for-one basis. RSUs granted under the 2022 Plan reduce the number of shares available for grant under the plan by a factor of two times the number of RSUs granted. RSUs canceled and shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations increase the number of shares available for grant under the 2022 Plan utilizing a factor of two times the number of RSUs canceled or shares withheld. All RSUs granted under the 2022 Plan have dividend equivalent rights (“DERs”), which entitle holders of RSUs to the same dividend value per share as holders of common stock. DERs are subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the underlying RSUs. A maximum of approximately 1.3 billion shares were authorized for issuance pursuant to 2022 Plan awards at the time the plan was approved on March 4, 2022. 2014 Employee Stock Plan The Apple Inc. 2014 Employee Stock Plan (the “2014 Plan”) is a shareholder-approved plan that provided for broad-based equity grants to employees, including executive officers. The 2014 Plan permitted the granting of substantially the same types of equity awards with substantially the same terms as the 2022 Plan. The 2014 Plan also permitted the granting of cash bonus awards. In the third quarter of 2022, the Company terminated the authority to grant new awards under the 2014 Plan. Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 46 Apple Inc. Non-Employee Director Stock Plan The Apple Inc. Non-Employee Director Stock Plan (the “Director Plan”) is a shareholder-approved plan that (i) permits the Company to grant awards of RSUs or stock options to the Company’s non-employee directors, (ii) provides for automatic initial grants of RSUs upon a non-employee director joining the Board of Directors and automatic annual grants of RSUs at each annual meeting of shareholders, and (iii) permits the Board of Directors to prospectively change the value and relative mixture of stock options and RSUs for the initial and annual award grants and the methodology for determining the number of shares of the Company’s common stock subject to these grants, in each case within the limits set forth in the Director Plan and without further shareholder approval. RSUs granted under the Director Plan reduce the number of shares available for grant under the plan by a factor of two times the number of RSUs granted. The Director Plan expires on November 12, 2027. All RSUs granted under the Director Plan are entitled to DERs, which are subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the underlying RSUs. A maximum of approximately 45 million shares (split-adjusted) were authorized for issuance pursuant to Director Plan awards at the time the plan was last amended on November 9, 2021. Employee Stock Purchase Plan The Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “Purchase Plan”) is a shareholder-approved plan under which substantially all employees may voluntarily enroll to purchase the Company’s common stock through payroll deductions at a price equal to 85 % of the lower of the fair market values of the stock as of the beginning or the end of six-month offering periods. An employee’s payroll deductions under the Purchase Plan are limited to 10 % of the employee’s eligible compensation and employees may not purchase more than $ 25,000 of stock during any calendar year. A maximum of approximately 230 million shares (split-adjusted) were authorized for issuance under the Purchase Plan at the time the plan was last amended and restated on March 10, 2015. 401(k) Plan The Company’s 401(k) Plan is a tax-qualified deferred compensation arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the 401(k) Plan, participating U.S. employees may contribute a portion of their eligible earnings, subject to applicable U.S. Internal Revenue Service and plan limits. The Company matches 50 % to 100 % of each employee’s contributions, depending on length of service, up to a maximum of 6 % of the employee’s eligible earnings. Restricted Stock Units A summary of the Company’s RSU activity and related information for 2022, 2021 and 2020, is as follows: Number of RSUs (in thousands) Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value Per RSU Aggregate Fair Value (in millions) Balance as of September 28, 2019 326,068 $ 42.30 RSUs granted 156,800 $ 59.20 RSUs vested ( 157,743 ) $ 40.29 RSUs canceled ( 14,347 ) $ 48.07 Balance as of September 26, 2020 310,778 $ 51.58 RSUs granted 89,363 $ 116.33 RSUs vested ( 145,766 ) $ 50.71 RSUs canceled ( 13,948 ) $ 68.95 Balance as of September 25, 2021 240,427 $ 75.16 RSUs granted 91,674 $ 150.70 RSUs vested ( 115,861 ) $ 72.12 RSUs canceled ( 14,739 ) $ 99.77 Balance as of September 24, 2022 201,501 $ 109.48 $ 30,312 The fair value as of the respective vesting dates of RSUs was $ 18.2 billion, $ 19.0 billion and $ 10.8 billion for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The majority of RSUs that vested in 2022, 2021 and 2020 were net share settled such that the Company withheld shares with a value equivalent to the employees’ obligation for the applicable income and other employment taxes, and remitted the cash to the appropriate taxing authorities. The total shares withheld were approximately 41 million, 53 million and 56 million for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and were based on the value of the RSUs on their respective vesting dates as determined by the Company’s closing stock price. Total payments to taxing authorities for employees’ tax obligations were $ 6.4 billion, $ 6.8 billion and $ 3.9 billion in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 47 Share-Based Compensation The following table shows share-based compensation expense and the related income tax benefit included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for 2022, 2021 and 2020 (in millions): 2022 2021 2020 Share-based compensation expense $ 9,038 $ 7,906 $ 6,829 Income tax benefit related to share-based compensation expense $ ( 4,002 ) $ ( 4,056 ) $ ( 2,476 ) As of September 24, 2022, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding RSUs and stock options was $ 16.7 billion, which the Company expects to recognize over a weighted-average period of 2.6 years. Note 10 – Commitments and Contingencies Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product Although most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements. Substantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia, with some Mac computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland. Unconditional Purchase Obligations The Company has entered into certain off–balance sheet commitments that require the future purchase of goods or services (“unconditional purchase obligations”). The Company’s unconditional purchase obligations primarily consist of payments for supplier arrangements, internet services and content creation. Future payments under noncancelable unconditional purchase obligations with a remaining term in excess of one year as of September 24, 2022, are as follows (in millions): 2023 $ 13,488 2024 4,876 2025 1,418 2026 6,780 2027 312 Thereafter 412 Total $ 27,286 Contingencies The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully resolved. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims.

Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 49 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Apple Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Apple Inc. as of September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 24, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Apple Inc. at September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 24, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the “PCAOB”), Apple Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 24, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated October 27, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of Apple Inc.’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Apple Inc.’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Apple Inc. in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates. Uncertain Tax Positions Description of the Matter As discussed in Note 5 to the financial statements, Apple Inc. is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and many state and foreign jurisdictions. As of September 24, 2022, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $ 16.8 billion, of which $ 8.0 billion, if recognized, would impact Apple Inc.’s effective tax rate. In accounting for uncertain tax positions, Apple Inc. uses significant judgment in the interpretation and application of complex domestic and international tax laws. Auditing management’s evaluation of whether an uncertain tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and the measurement of the benefit of various tax positions can be complex, involves significant judgment, and is based on interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings. Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 50 How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We tested controls relating to the evaluation of uncertain tax positions, including controls over management’s assessment as to whether tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained, management’s process to measure the benefit of its tax positions, and the development of the related disclosures. To evaluate Apple Inc.’s assessment of which tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained, our audit procedures included, among others, reading and evaluating management’s assumptions and analysis, and, as applicable, Apple Inc.’s communications with taxing authorities, that detailed the basis and technical merits of the uncertain tax positions. We involved our tax subject matter resources in assessing the technical merits of certain of Apple Inc.’s tax positions based on our knowledge of relevant tax laws and experience with related taxing authorities. For certain tax positions, we also received external legal counsel confirmation letters and discussed the matters with external advisors and Apple Inc. tax personnel. In addition, we evaluated Apple Inc.’s disclosure in relation to these matters included in Note 5 to the financial statements. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP We have served as Apple Inc.’s auditor since 2009. San Jose, California October 27, 2022 Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 51 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Apple Inc. Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have audited Apple Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 24, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the “COSO criteria”). In our opinion, Apple Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 24, 2022, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the “PCAOB”), the consolidated balance sheets of Apple Inc. as of September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 24, 2022, and the related notes and our report dated October 27, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion Apple Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Apple Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Apple Inc. in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP San Jose, California October 27, 2022 Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 52 Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure None. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act were effective as of September 24, 2022 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Inherent Limitations over Internal Controls The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company’s assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that the Company’s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company’s management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company’s internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on the Company’s assessment, management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 24, 2022 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, which appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2022, which were identified in connection with management’s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 1 Services Advertising The Company’s advertising services include various third-party licensing arrangements and the Company’s own advertising platforms. AppleCare The Company offers a portfolio of fee-based service and support products under the AppleCare ® brand. The offerings provide priority access to Apple technical support, access to the global Apple authorized service network for repair and replacement services, and in many cases additional coverage for instances of accidental damage and/or theft and loss, depending on the country and type of product.

Payment Services The Company offers payment services, including Apple Card ® , a co-branded credit card, and Apple Pay ® , a cashless payment service. Markets and Distribution The Company’s customers are primarily in the consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise and government markets. The Company sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. The Company also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels, such as third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. During 2021, the Company’s net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 36% and 64%, respectively, of total net sales. Competition The markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive, and are characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. Many of the Company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company’s products and infringing on its intellectual property. The Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service features (including security features), relative price and performance, product and service quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and accessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, and corporate reputation. Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 2 The Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories, and services. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software, and service offerings with large customer bases. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company’s services compete with business models that provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company’s product features and applications within their products, or collaborate to offer integrated solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. Supply of Components Although most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements. The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Substantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia, with some Mac computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland. Research and Development Because the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through research and development (“R&D”), licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology. Intellectual Property The Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices, accessories, software and services. This includes patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade dress and other forms of intellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although the Company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel. The Company regularly files patent applications to protect innovations arising from its research, development and design, and is currently pursuing thousands of patent applications around the world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued patents, including utility patents, design patents and others. The Company also holds copyrights relating to certain aspects of its products and services. No single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company’s products. The Company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products. In addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the Company’s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of the Company’s products, processes and services. While the Company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all. Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 3 Business Seasonality and Product Introductions The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction. Human Capital The Company believes it has a talented, motivated, and dedicated team, and is committed to supporting the development of all of its team members and to continuously building on its strong culture. As of September 25, 2021, the Company had approximately 154,000 full-time equivalent employees. Workplace Practices and Policies The Company is committed to providing a workplace free of harassment or discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, disability, veteran status, caste or other legally protected characteristic. The Company is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion and diversity. Compensation and Benefits The Company believes that compensation should not only be competitive; it should be equitable and should enable employees to share in the Company’s success as shareholders of the Company. The Company recognizes its people are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their needs and the time and support to succeed in their professional and personal lives. In support of this, the Company offers a wide variety of benefits to employees around the world. Growth and Development The Company invests in tools and resources that support employees’ individual growth and development. The Company also provides classes and seminars to foster understanding and critical thinking about the Company’s culture, organization and values. Inclusion and Diversity The Company is committed to hiring inclusively, providing training and development opportunities, fostering an inclusive culture, and ensuring equitable pay for employees, and is continuing to focus on increasing diverse representation at every level of the Company. The Company has initiatives in place to implement its commitment to increase diverse representation, including creating diverse interview panels and candidate slates, focusing on robust diversity recruiting efforts, and expanding diversity outreach efforts through organizations that serve and engage talent from underrepresented communities. The Company also offers team members access to ongoing inclusion and diversity education, and support throughout their career journey and helps them find community and connection through employee groups that create spaces for belonging, learning, and growing inclusivity, diversity and equity efforts. Engagement The Company believes that open and honest communication among team members, managers and leadership fosters an open, collaborative work environment where everyone can participate, develop and thrive. Team members are encouraged to come to their managers with questions, feedback or concerns, and the Company regularly conducts surveys that gauge employee sentiment in areas like career development, manager performance and inclusivity. Health and Safety The Company is committed to protecting its employees everywhere it operates. The Company identifies potential risks associated with workplace activities in order to develop measures to mitigate possible hazards. The Company supports employees with general safety training and puts specific programs in place for those working in potentially high-hazard environments, including chemical management, laser safety, equipment and machinery safety, hazardous materials management and electrical safety. The Company has taken additional measures during the COVID-19 pandemic, including providing information resources, testing, face masks and personal protective equipment, and case support. The Company also offers special sick leave for employees with possible COVID-19 symptoms, as well as comprehensive health coverage.

Risk Factors The Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition, as well as the price of the Company’s stock, can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described below. When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition, as well as the price of the Company’s stock, can be materially and adversely affected. Because of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company’s results of operations and financial condition, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. This discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. This section should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K. Risks Related to COVID-19 The Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition, as well as the price of the Company’s stock, have been adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 has had, and continues to have, a significant impact around the world, prompting governments and businesses to take unprecedented measures in response. Such measures have included restrictions on travel and business operations, temporary closures of businesses, and quarantine and shelter-in-place orders. The COVID-19 pandemic has at times significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets. The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have adversely affected and could in the future materially adversely impact the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition, as well as the price of the Company’s stock. During the course of the pandemic, certain of the Company’s component suppliers and manufacturing and logistical service providers have experienced disruptions, resulting in supply shortages that affected sales worldwide, and similar disruptions could occur in the future. The Company’s retail stores, as well as channel partner points of sale, have been temporarily closed at various times. In many cases, as stores and points of sale have reopened, they are subject to operating restrictions to protect public health and the health and safety of employees and customers. The Company has at times required substantially all of its employees to work remotely. The Company continues to monitor the situation and take appropriate actions in accordance with the recommendations and requirements of relevant authorities. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact the Company’s operational and financial performance remains uncertain and will depend on many factors outside the Company’s control, including the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic, the emergence of new variants, the development, availability, distribution and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products. Additional future impacts on the Company may include, but are not limited to, material adverse effects on demand for the Company’s products and services, the Company’s supply chain and sales and distribution channels, the Company’s ability to execute its strategic plans, and the Company’s profitability and cost structure. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. Macroeconomic and Industry Risks The Company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’s total net sales. In addition, the Company’s global supply chain is large and complex and a majority of the Company’s supplier facilities, including manufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the U.S. As a result, the Company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions. Adverse macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, slower growth or recession, new or increased tariffs and other barriers to trade, changes to fiscal and monetary policy, tighter credit, higher interest rates, high unemployment and currency fluctuations can materially adversely affect demand for the Company’s products and services. In addition, consumer confidence and spending can be adversely affected in response to financial market volatility, negative financial news, conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets, declines in income or asset values, changes to fuel and other energy costs, labor and healthcare costs and other economic factors. Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 6 In addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company’s products, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic conditions can have a significant impact on the Company’s suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners. Potential effects include financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance operations and purchases of the Company’s products; and insolvency. A downturn in the economic environment can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company’s trade receivables; the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the Company’s ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair value of the Company’s financial instruments. These and other economic factors can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company’s business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions. Political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners. The Company has a large, global business, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. Trade and other international disputes can result in tariffs, sanctions, and other measures that restrict international trade and can adversely affect the Company’s business. For example, tensions between the U.S. and China have led to a series of tariffs being imposed by the U.S. on imports from China mainland, as well as other business restrictions. Tariffs increase the cost of the Company’s products and the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs adversely impact the gross margin that the Company earns on its products. Tariffs can also make the Company’s products more expensive for customers, which could make the Company’s products less competitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also adopt other measures, such as controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, that could adversely impact the Company’s operations and supply chain and limit the Company’s ability to offer its products and services as designed. These measures can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers, restructuring business relationships, and ceasing to offer third-party applications on its platforms. Changing the Company’s operations in accordance with new or changed trade restrictions can be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the Company’s operations and distracting to management. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. Political uncertainty surrounding trade and other international disputes could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company’s business. Many of the Company’s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company’s suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company’s control. Global climate change is resulting in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Such events can make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company’s supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company’s service offerings. Following an interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company. The Company’s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While the Company’s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in disruption to the Company’s business and harm to the Company’s reputation. Major public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the future adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products; the imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement of products between regions; and disruptions in the Company’s supply chain and sales and distribution channels, resulting in interruptions of the supply of current products and delays in production ramps of new products. While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise. Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 7 Global markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets. The Company’s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. The Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in R&D. There can be no assurance these investments will achieve expected returns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully. The Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to register, additional patents, trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company’s products and infringing on its intellectual property. Effective intellectual property protection is not consistently available in every country in which the Company operates. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the Company’s intellectual property, the Company’s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be adversely affected. The Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. Some of the markets in which the Company competes have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall. Additionally, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company’s product features and applications within their products or collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the Company’s approach to providing components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions. The Company’s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition depend substantially on the Company’s ability to continually improve its products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively. Business Risks To remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services. Due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services, and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services. The success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors, including timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company’s ability to manage the risks associated with production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for the Company’s products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies. There can be no assurance the Company will successfully manage future introductions and transitions of products and services. Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 8 The Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of which are located outside of the U.S. Substantially all of the Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia. A significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements can lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company’s direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished control has from time to time and may in the future have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products manufactured or services provided, or adversely affect the Company’s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product defects and experiences an unanticipated product defect liability from time to time. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, violations of the supplier code of conduct occur from time to time and can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. The Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many components, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company’s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can have a negative impact on the Company’s cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, military actions, economic, business, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, or international trade disputes. The Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be reduced or terminated, and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted. Future operating results depend upon the Company’s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms. Because the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the global semiconductor industry is experiencing high demand and shortages of supply, which has adversely affected, and could materially adversely affect, the Company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components and products on commercially reasonable terms or at all. While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The effects of global or regional economic conditions on the Company’s suppliers, described in “ The Company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition, ” above, can also affect the Company’s ability to obtain components . Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company’s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements. When the Company’s supply of components for a new or existing product has been delayed or constrained, or when an outsourcing partner has delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company’s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 9 The Company’s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the Company’s business and result in harm to the Company’s reputation. The Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the Company, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products. Defects can also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects could make the Company’s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the Company’s products are introduced into specialized applications, including healthcare. In addition, the Company’s service offerings can have quality issues and from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, the Company’s services from time to time have not performed as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software and services it offers. Failure to do so can result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the Company’s products and services. In addition, the Company can be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property, plant and equipment, and/or intangible assets, and significant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems can also adversely affect the experience for users of the Company’s products and services, and result in harm to the Company’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales. The Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk. The Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers’ facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable, there can be no assurance the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes. The Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. Manufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company’s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for periods up to 150 days. Because the Company’s markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments. The Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The Company’s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties, which requires licenses from those third parties. In addition, because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company currently competes or in the future may compete, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, the Company’s products and services may unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Based on experience and industry practice, the Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, can preclude the Company from selling certain products or services, or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company’s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers. The Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications and services. There can be no assurance third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the Company’s products. If third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company’s products, customers may choose not to buy the Company’s products. The Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers’ perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the Company’s products compared to competitors’ platforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets, Windows for personal computers and tablets, and PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for gaming platforms. This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of product sales, and the costs of developing such applications and services. Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 10 The Company’s minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets can make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company’s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors’ products with larger market share. When developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company’s devices can suffer. The Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products. The Company’s products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and when third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, their applications can fail to take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences and can operate incorrectly and can result in dissatisfied customers. The Company distributes third-party applications for its products through the App Store. For the vast majority of applications, developers keep all of the revenue they generate on the App Store. The Company only retains a commission from sales of applications and sales of digital services or goods within an application. From time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to competition, market and legal conditions. The Company may make further business changes in the future. New legislative initiatives, such as the proposed European Union (“EU”) Digital Markets Act, could, if enacted, require further changes. The Company is also subject to litigation and investigations relating to the App Store, which have resulted in changes to the Company’s business practices, and may in the future result in further changes. These changes could include how and to what extent the Company charges developers for access to its platforms and manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store. This could reduce the volume of sales, and the commission that the Company earns on those sales, would decrease. If the rate of the commission that the Company retains on such sales is reduced, or if it is otherwise narrowed in scope or eliminated, the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Failure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the Company’s customers, or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell, or offer subscriptions to, third-party content, as well as the right to incorporate specific content into the Company’s own services. The licensing or other distribution arrangements for this content can be for relatively short time periods and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and can take actions to make it difficult or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company’s access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules. The Company also produces its own digital content, which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing competition for talent, content and subscribers, and may fail to appeal to the Company’s customers. The COVID-19 pandemic has also caused additional restrictions on production and increased costs for digital content. Some third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. If requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner. The Company’s success depends largely on the continued service and availability of highly skilled employees, including key personnel. Much of the Company’s future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly skilled employees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley, where most of the Company’s key personnel are located. The Company believes that its distinctive and inclusive culture is a significant driver of its success. If the Company is unable to nurture and maintain its culture, it could adversely affect the Company’s ability to recruit and retain highly skilled employees and materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company depends on the performance of carriers, wholesalers, retailers and other resellers. The Company distributes its products through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers, many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers. The Company also sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. Some carriers providing cellular network service for the Company’s products offer financing, installment payment plans or subsidies for users’ purchases of the device. There can be no assurance such offers will be continued at all or in the same amounts. Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 11 The Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers’ stores with Company employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays. These programs can require a substantial investment while not assuring return or incremental sales. The financial condition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Company’s products, or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the Company’s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company’s products. The Company’s business and reputation are impacted by information technology system failures and network disruptions. The Company and its global supply chain are exposed to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, ransomware or other cybersecurity incidents, or other events or disruptions. System redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company’s or its vendors’ business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions can adversely impact the Company’s business by, among other things, preventing access to the Company’s online services, interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the Company’s products. These events could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. Losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personal information, could subject the Company to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences. The Company’s business requires it to use and store confidential information, including personal information, with respect to the Company’s customers and employees. The Company devotes significant resources to network and data security, including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data. But these measures cannot provide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. The Company’s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties. The Company relies on global suppliers that are also exposed to ransomware and other malicious attacks that can disrupt business operations. Although the Company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to or accessible by third parties working on the Company’s behalf, such measures are not always effective and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur. Such incidents and other malicious attacks could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. The Company experiences malicious attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to its systems on a regular basis. These attacks seek to compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential information or disrupt normal business operations, and could, among other things, impair the Company’s ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services, impact the price of the Company’s stock, materially damage commercial relationships, and expose the Company to litigation or government investigations, which could result in penalties, fines or judgments against the Company. Globally, attacks are expected to continue accelerating in both frequency and sophistication with increasing use by actors of tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent controls, avoid detection, and remove or obfuscate forensic evidence, all of which hinders the Company’s ability to identify, investigate and recover from incidents. Although malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information, including personal information, affect many companies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and processes. The Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data, and mitigate the impact of unauthorized access, including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies. As with all companies, these security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking, ransomware attacks, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty password management or other irregularities. For example, third parties can fraudulently induce the Company’s or its vendors’ employees or customers into disclosing user names, passwords or other sensitive information, which can, in turn, be used for unauthorized access to the Company’s or its vendors’ systems and services. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company deploys and makes available technologies like multifactor authentication, monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, can result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the Company’s products and services. While the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise. Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 12 Investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company’s ongoing business, present risks not originally contemplated and adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. The Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater-than-expected liabilities and expenses, economic, political, legal and regulatory challenges associated with operating in new businesses, regions or countries, inadequate return on capital, potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets, and significant write-offs. Investment and acquisition transactions are exposed to additional risks, including failing to obtain required regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all, or the imposition of onerous conditions that could delay or prevent the Company from completing a transaction or otherwise limit the Company’s ability to fully realize the anticipated benefits of a transaction. These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful. The failure of any significant investment could adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. The Company’s retail stores have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. The Company’s retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory and personnel. The Company also has entered into substantial lease commitments for retail space. Certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than the Company’s more typical retail stores. Due to the high cost structure associated with the Company’s retail stores, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of an individual store or multiple stores, including as a result of protective public safety measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance costs. The Company’s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition, including macro-economic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity. Other factors include the Company’s ability to: manage costs associated with retail store construction and operation; manage relationships with existing retail partners; manage costs associated with fluctuations in the value of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost. Legal and Regulatory Compliance Risks The Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings or government investigations. The Company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved, and new matters may arise in the future. In addition, agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which can subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. The number of claims, legal proceedings and government investigations involving the Company, and the alleged magnitude of such claims, proceedings and government investigations, has generally increased over time and may continue to increase. The Company has faced and continues to face a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled products, and new claims may arise in the future. For example, technology and other patent-holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in several U.S. jurisdictions, as well as internationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages. Regardless of the merit of particular claims, defending against litigation or responding to government investigations can be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the Company’s operations and distracting to management. In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such challenges. There can be no assurance such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These agreements can also significantly increase the Company’s cost of sales and operating expenses and require the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company’s ability to offer certain products and services. Except as described in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading “Legal Proceedings” and in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, “Commitments and Contingencies” under the heading “Contingencies,” in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims. Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 13 The outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s results of operations and financial condition for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome can result in significant compensatory, punitive or trebled monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company, and can require the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company’s ability to offer certain products and services, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise. The Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects on the Company’s business. The Company’s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects, including antitrust; privacy, data security and data localization; consumer protection; advertising, sales, billing and e-commerce; product liability; intellectual property ownership and infringement; digital platforms; Internet, telecommunications, and mobile communications; media, television, film and digital content; availability of third-party software applications and services; labor and employment; anticorruption; import, export and trade; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; anti–money laundering; foreign ownership and investment; tax; and environmental, health and safety, including electronic waste, recycling, and climate change. Compliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive, increasing the cost of conducting the Company’s global operations. Changes to laws and regulations can adversely affect the Company’s business by increasing the Company’s costs, limiting the Company’s ability to offer a product or service to customers, requiring changes to the Company’s supply chain and business practices or otherwise making the Company’s products and services less attractive to customers. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance the Company’s employees, contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company’s policies and procedures. If the Company is found to have violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. Regulatory changes and other actions that materially adversely affect the Company’s business may be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. The technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and regulatory scrutiny, which exposes the Company to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions and penalties. From time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to competition, market and legal conditions. The Company may make further business changes in the future. New legislative initiatives, such as the proposed EU Digital Markets Act, could, if enacted, require further changes. These changes could include how and to what extent the Company charges developers for access to its platforms and manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store. The Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations in various jurisdictions around the world, which can result in legal proceedings and claims against the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company is the subject of investigations in Europe and other jurisdictions relating to App Store terms and conditions. If such investigations result in adverse findings against the Company, the Company could be exposed to significant fines and may be required to make changes to its App Store business, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company is also subject to litigation relating to the App Store, which has resulted in changes to the Company’s business practices, and may in the future result in further changes. Further, the Company has commercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that are or may become subject to investigations and litigation that, if resolved against those other companies, could adversely affect the Company’s commercial relationships with those business partners and materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company earns revenue from licensing arrangements with other companies to offer their search services on the Company’s platforms and apps, and certain of these arrangements are currently subject to government investigations and legal proceedings. There can be no assurance the Company’s business will not be materially adversely affected, individually or in the aggregate, by the outcomes of such investigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future. Changes to the Company’s business practices to comply with new laws and regulations or in connection with other legal proceedings could negatively impact the reputation of the Company’s products for privacy and security and otherwise adversely affect the experience for users of the Company’s products and services, and result in harm to the Company’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, and lost sales. Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 14 The Company’s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding data protection. The Company is subject to federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of various types of personal information. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also restrict transfers of personal information among the Company and its international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and additional jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions or have laws that are pending. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing requirements causes the Company to incur substantial costs and has required and may in the future require the Company to change its business practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability. The Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of personal information through its privacy policy, information provided on its website, press statements and other privacy notices provided to customers. Any failure by the Company to comply with these public statements or with other federal, state or international privacy or data protection laws and regulations could result in inquiries or proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. In addition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability. In addition to the risks generally relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal information, the Company is also subject to specific obligations relating to information considered sensitive under applicable laws, such as health data, financial data and biometric data. Health data is subject to additional privacy, security and breach notification requirements, and the Company is subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the Company’s compliance with these obligations. If the Company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements, or if health data is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the Company’s agreements with healthcare institutions, the Company can be subject to litigation or government investigations, and can be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and can also incur significant fees or fines. Financial data, such as payment card data, is also subject to additional requirements. Under payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder information is potentially compromised, the Company can be liable for associated investigatory expenses and can also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards. The Company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards, which would materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. Financial Risks The Company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate. The Company’s profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For example, the gross margins on the Company’s products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The Company’s gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in response to such pressures; increased competition; the Company’s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering content for the Company’s services; the Company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that regulatory changes require the Company to modify its product and service offerings; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; and the introduction of new products or services, including new products or services with higher cost structures. These and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition. The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company’s products or services, issues with new product or service introductions, information technology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company’s logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners. The Company’s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies. The Company’s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non–U.S. dollar–denominated sales, cost of sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company’s products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 15 The weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company’s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar’s strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency–denominated sales. Conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Company’s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins. The Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place. The Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio. The Company’s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and economic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition. The Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen. The Company distributes its products through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. The Company also sells its products directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the Company’s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant portion of the Company’s trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers. The Company’s exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September 25, 2021, the Company’s vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses. The Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and exposure to additional tax liabilities. The Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland, where a number of the Company’s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws and tax rates for income taxes and other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. The Company’s effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including in the U.S. and Ireland. The Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company’s effective tax rates were to increase, particularly in the U.S. or Ireland, or if the ultimate determination of the Company’s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 16 General Risks The price of the Company’s stock is subject to volatility. The Company’s stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, the Company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have, from time to time, experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies’ operating performance. Price volatility may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its stock in a given period to exceed the stock’s price at a given point in time. The Company believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability. The Company also believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow, and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Company’s Board of Directors, and the Company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, the price of the Company’s stock may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. Item 2. Properties The Company’s headquarters are located in Cupertino, California. As of September 25, 2021, the Company owned or leased facilities and land for corporate functions, R&D, data centers, retail and other purposes at locations throughout the U.S. and in various places outside the U.S. The Company believes its existing facilities and equipment, which are used by all reportable segments, are in good operating condition and are suitable for the conduct of its business. Item 3. Legal Proceedings The Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The Company’s material legal proceedings are described below and in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, “Commitments and Contingencies” under the heading “Contingencies.” The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. The Company settled certain matters during the fourth quarter of 2021 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating results. Epic Games Epic Games, Inc. (“Epic”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the “Northern California District Court”) against the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California’s unfair competition law based upon the Company’s operation of its App Store. The Company filed a counterclaim for breach of contract. On September 10, 2021, the Northern California District Court ruled in favor of the Company with respect to nine out of the ten counts included in Epic’s claim, and in favor of the Company with respect to the Company’s claims for breach of contract. The Northern California District Court found that certain provisions of the Company’s App Store Review Guidelines violate California’s unfair competition law and issued an injunction. Epic appealed the decision. The Company filed a cross-appeal and is seeking a stay of the injunction pending appeal. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures Not applicable.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This section of this Form 10-K generally discusses 2021 and 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020. Discussions of 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019 are not included in this Form 10-K, and can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 26, 2020. Fiscal Year Highlights COVID-19 Update The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and continues to have, a significant impact around the world, prompting governments and businesses to take unprecedented measures, such as restrictions on travel and business operations, temporary closures of businesses, and quarantine and shelter-in-place orders. The COVID-19 pandemic has at times significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets. The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have affected and could in the future materially impact the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition, as well as the price of the Company’s stock. During 2021, aspects of the Company’s business continued to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with many of the Company’s retail stores, as well as channel partner points of sale, temporarily closed at various times, and a significant number of the Company’s employees working remotely. The Company has reopened all of its retail stores and substantially all of its other facilities, subject to operating restrictions to protect public health and the health and safety of employees and customers, and it continues to work on safely reopening the remainder of its facilities, subject to local rules and regulations. During the fourth quarter of 2021, certain of the Company’s component suppliers and logistical service providers experienced disruptions, resulting in supply shortages that affected sales worldwide. Similar disruptions could occur in the future. The extent of the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s operational and financial performance is uncertain and will depend on many factors outside the Company’s control, including the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic, the emergence of new variants, the development, availability, distribution and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products.

Fiscal 2021 Highlights Total net sales increased 33% or $91.3 billion during 2021 compared to 2020, driven by growth in all Products and Services categories. Year-over-year net sales during 2021 also grew in each of the Company’s reportable segments. In April 2021, the Company announced an increase to its current share repurchase program authorization from $225 billion to $315 billion and raised its quarterly dividend from $0.205 to $0.22 per share beginning in May 2021. During 2021, the Company repurchased $85.5 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $14.5 billion. Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 20 Products and Services Performance The following table shows net sales by category for 2021, 2020 and 2019 (dollars in millions): 2021 Change 2020 Change 2019 Net sales by category: iPhone (1) $ 191,973 39 % $ 137,781 (3) % $ 142,381 Mac (1) 35,190 23 % 28,622 11 % 25,740 iPad (1) 31,862 34 % 23,724 11 % 21,280 Wearables, Home and Accessories (1)(2) 38,367 25 % 30,620 25 % 24,482 Services (3) 68,425 27 % 53,768 16 % 46,291 Total net sales $ 365,817 33 % $ 274,515 6 % $ 260,174 (1) Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are bundled in the sales price of the respective product.

(3) Services net sales include sales from the Company’s advertising, AppleCare, cloud, digital content, payment and other services. Services net sales also include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain products. iPhone iPhone net sales increased during 2021 compared to 2020 due primarily to higher net sales from the Company’s new iPhone models launched in the first quarter and fourth quarter of 2021 and a favorable mix of iPhone sales. Mac Mac net sales increased during 2021 compared to 2020 due primarily to higher net sales of MacBook Air, MacBook Pro and iMac. iPad iPad net sales increased during 2021 compared to 2020 due primarily to higher net sales of iPad Air and iPad Pro. Wearables, Home and Accessories Wearables, Home and Accessories net sales increased during 2021 compared to 2020 due primarily to higher net sales of accessories and Apple Watch. Services Services net sales increased during 2021 compared to 2020 due primarily to higher net sales from advertising, the App Store and cloud services. Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 21 Segment Operating Performance The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. Further information regarding the Company’s reportable segments can be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 11, “Segment Information and Geographic Data.” The following table shows net sales by reportable segment for 2021, 2020 and 2019 (dollars in millions): 2021 Change 2020 Change 2019 Net sales by reportable segment: Americas $ 153,306 23 % $ 124,556 7 % $ 116,914 Europe 89,307 30 % 68,640 14 % 60,288 Greater China 68,366 70 % 40,308 (8) % 43,678 Japan 28,482 33 % 21,418 — % 21,506 Rest of Asia Pacific 26,356 35 % 19,593 10 % 17,788 Total net sales $ 365,817 33 % $ 274,515 6 % $ 260,174 Americas Americas net sales increased during 2021 compared to 2020 due primarily to higher net sales of iPhone, Services and Mac. Europe Europe net sales increased during 2021 compared to 2020 due primarily to higher net sales of iPhone, Services and iPad. The movement of foreign currencies in Europe relative to the U.S. dollar had a net favorable impact on Europe net sales during 2021. Greater China Greater China net sales increased during 2021 compared to 2020 due primarily to higher net sales of iPhone, iPad and Services. The strength of the Chinese renminbi relative to the U.S. dollar had a favorable impact on Greater China net sales during 2021. Japan Japan net sales increased during 2021 compared to 2020 due primarily to higher net sales of iPhone and Services. Rest of Asia Pacific Rest of Asia Pacific net sales increased during 2021 compared to 2020 due primarily to higher net sales of iPhone, iPad and Services. The movement of foreign currencies in the Rest of Asia Pacific relative to the U.S. dollar had a favorable impact on Rest of Asia Pacific net sales during 2021. Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 22 Gross Margin Products and Services gross margin and gross margin percentage for 2021, 2020 and 2019 were as follows (dollars in millions): 2021 2020 2019 Gross margin: Products $ 105,126 $ 69,461 $ 68,887 Services 47,710 35,495 29,505 Total gross margin $ 152,836 $ 104,956 $ 98,392 Gross margin percentage: Products 35.3 % 31.5 % 32.2 % Services 69.7 % 66.0 % 63.7 % Total gross margin percentage 41.8 % 38.2 % 37.8 % Products Gross Margin Products gross margin increased during 2021 compared to 2020 due primarily to higher Products volume, a different Products mix and the strength in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Products gross margin percentage increased during 2021 compared to 2020 due primarily to a different Products mix, improved leverage and the strength in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Services Gross Margin Services gross margin increased during 2021 compared to 2020 due primarily to higher Services net sales and a different Services mix. Services gross margin percentage increased during 2021 compared to 2020 due primarily to a different Services mix and improved leverage, partially offset by higher Services costs. The Company’s future gross margins can be impacted by a variety of factors, as discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.” As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and downward pressure. Operating Expenses Operating expenses for 2021, 2020 and 2019 were as follows (dollars in millions): 2021 Change 2020 Change 2019 Research and development $ 21,914 17 % $ 18,752 16 % $ 16,217 Percentage of total net sales 6 % 7 % 6 % Selling, general and administrative $ 21,973 10 % $ 19,916 9 % $ 18,245 Percentage of total net sales 6 % 7 % 7 % Total operating expenses $ 43,887 13 % $ 38,668 12 % $ 34,462 Percentage of total net sales 12 % 14 % 13 % Research and Development The year-over-year growth in R&D expense in 2021 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses, R&D-related professional services and infrastructure-related costs. The Company continues to believe that focused investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace, and to the development of new and updated products and services that are central to the Company’s core business strategy. Selling, General and Administrative The year-over-year growth in selling, general and administrative expense in 2021 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses, variable selling expenses and professional services. Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 23 Other Income/(Expense), Net Other income/(expense), net (“OI&E”) for 2021, 2020 and 2019 was as follows (dollars in millions): 2021 Change 2020 Change 2019 Interest and dividend income $ 2,843 $ 3,763 $ 4,961 Interest expense (2,645) (2,873) (3,576) Other income/(expense), net 60 (87) 422 Total other income/(expense), net $ 258 (68) % $ 803 (56) % $ 1,807 The year-over-year decrease in OI&E during 2021 was due primarily to lower interest income and net losses on marketable securities, partially offset by positive fair value adjustments on non-marketable securities and lower interest expense on term debt. Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for 2021, 2020 and 2019 were as follows (dollars in millions): 2021 2020 2019 Provision for income taxes $ 14,527 $ 9,680 $ 10,481 Effective tax rate 13.3 % 14.4 % 15.9 % Statutory federal income tax rate 21 % 21 % 21 % The Company’s effective tax rate for 2021 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, tax benefits from share-based compensation and foreign-derived intangible income deductions. The Company’s effective tax rate for 2020 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to the lower tax rate on foreign earnings, including the impact of tax settlements, and tax benefits from share-based compensation. The Company’s effective tax rate for 2021 was lower compared to 2020 due primarily to higher tax benefits from foreign-derived intangible income deductions and share-based compensation and the favorable impact of changes in unrecognized tax benefits, partially offset by a one-time adjustment in 2020 of U.S. foreign tax credits in response to regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in December 2019. During 2021, the Company established deferred tax assets (“DTAs”) for foreign tax credit carryforwards in Ireland and increased DTAs for R&D tax credit carryforwards in California, which resulted in a combined $3.5 billion increase in the valuation allowance on the Company’s DTAs, with no effect on net income. Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to realize substantially all of the Company’s remaining DTAs. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, which totaled $172.6 billion as of September 25, 2021, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond. The Company’s material cash requirements include the following contractual and other obligations. Debt As of September 25, 2021, the Company had outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $118.1 billion (collectively the “Notes”), with $9.6 billion payable within 12 months. Future interest payments associated with the Notes total $39.5 billion, with $2.9 billion payable within 12 months. The Company also issues unsecured short-term promissory notes (“Commercial Paper”) pursuant to a commercial paper program. As of September 25, 2021, the Company had $6.0 billion of Commercial Paper outstanding, all of which was payable within 12 months. Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 24 Leases The Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including retail, corporate, manufacturing and data center space. As of September 25, 2021, the Company had fixed lease payment obligations of $14.6 billion, with $1.8 billion payable within 12 months. Manufacturing Purchase Obligations The Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company’s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. As of September 25, 2021, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $54.8 billion, with $54.7 billion payable within 12 months. The Company’s manufacturing purchase obligations are primarily noncancelable. Other Purchase Obligations The Company’s other purchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and noncancelable obligations related to advertising, content creation and Internet and telecommunications services. As of September 25, 2021, the Company had other purchase obligations of $8.3 billion, with $4.8 billion payable within 12 months. Deemed Repatriation Tax Payable As of September 25, 2021, the balance of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Act”) was $24.6 billion, none of which is payable within 12 months. In addition to its cash requirements, the Company has a capital return program authorized by the Board of Directors. The Program does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares. As of September 25, 2021, the Company’s quarterly cash dividend was $0.22 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Uncertain Tax Positions The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company’s uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the Act and matters related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company’s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company’s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination or the refinement of an estimate. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results. Legal and Other Contingencies The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results. Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 25 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management The Company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps, both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate exposures. Given the effective horizons of the Company’s risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures, there can be no assurance these positions will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates. Further, the recognition of the gains and losses related to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and operating results. Interest Rate Risk The Company’s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company’s investment portfolio and outstanding debt. While the Company is exposed to global interest rate fluctuations, the Company’s interest income and expense are most sensitive to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and the fair value of those securities, as well as costs associated with hedging and interest paid on the Company’s debt. The Company’s investment policy and strategy are focused on the preservation of capital and supporting the Company’s liquidity requirements. The Company uses a combination of internal and external management to execute its investment strategy and achieve its investment objectives. The Company typically invests in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company’s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the Company’s investment portfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $4.1 billion and $3.1 billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio, respectively. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity. As of September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020, the Company had outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of $118.7 billion and $107.4 billion, respectively. The Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its outstanding term debt. Interest rate swaps allow the Company to effectively convert fixed-rate payments into floating-rate payments or floating-rate payments into fixed-rate payments. Gains and losses on term debt are generally offset by the corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instrument. A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the Company’s debt as of September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020 to increase by $186 million and $218 million on an annualized basis, respectively. Foreign Currency Risk In general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company’s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is a risk that the Company will have to adjust local currency pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. In addition, the Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on its foreign currency–denominated debt issuances. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 26 To provide an assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the Company’s foreign currency derivative positions, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk (“VAR”) model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model consisted of using a Monte Carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company’s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $550 million as of September 25, 2021, compared to a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $551 million as of September 26, 2020. Because the Company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, the losses in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures. Actual future gains and losses associated with the Company’s investment portfolio, debt and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of September 25, 2021 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and the Company’s actual exposures and positions.

Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 33 Apple Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation and Preparation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively “Apple” or the “Company”). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. In the opinion of the Company’s management, the consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation. The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. The Company’s fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019 spanned 52 weeks each. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Financial Instruments – Credit Losses At the beginning of the first quarter of 2021, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (the “FASB”) Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“ASU 2016-13”), which modifies the measurement of expected credit losses on certain financial instruments. The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 did not have a material impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements. Advertising Costs Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Share-Based Compensation The Company generally measures share-based compensation based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant, and recognizes expense on a straight-line basis for its estimate of equity awards that will ultimately vest. Further information regarding share-based compensation can be found in Note 9, “Benefit Plans.” Earnings Per Share The following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for 2021, 2020 and 2019 (net income in millions and shares in thousands): 2021 2020 2019 Numerator: Net income $ 94,680 $ 57,411 $ 55,256 Denominator: Weighted-average basic shares outstanding 16,701,272 17,352,119 18,471,336 Effect of dilutive securities 163,647 176,095 124,315 Weighted-average diluted shares 16,864,919 17,528,214 18,595,651 Basic earnings per share $ 5.67 $ 3.31 $ 2.99 Diluted earnings per share $ 5.61 $ 3.28 $ 2.97 Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 34 The Company applies the treasury stock method to determine the dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities. Potentially dilutive securities representing 62 million shares of common stock were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for 2019 because their effect would have been antidilutive. Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents. The Company’s investments in marketable debt securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. The Company classifies its marketable debt securities as either short-term or long-term based on each instrument’s underlying contractual maturity date. Unrealized gains and losses on marketable debt securities classified as available-for-sale are recognized in other comprehensive income/(loss) (“OCI”). The Company’s investments in marketable equity securities are classified based on the nature of the securities and their availability for use in current operations. The Company’s marketable equity securities are measured at fair value with gains and losses recognized in other income/(expense), net (“OI&E”). The cost of securities sold is determined using the specific identification method. Inventories Inventories are measured using the first-in, first-out method. Property, Plant and Equipment Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which for buildings is the lesser of 40 years or the remaining life of the building; between one and five years for machinery and equipment, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment; and the shorter of lease term or useful life for leasehold improvements. Capitalized costs related to internal-use software are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from five to seven years . Depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment was $ 9.5 billion, $ 9.7 billion and $ 11.3 billion during 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Noncash investing activities involving property, plant and equipment resulted in a net decrease to accounts payable and other current liabilities of $ 2.9 billion during 2019. Restricted Cash and Restricted Marketable Securities The Company considers cash and marketable securities to be restricted when withdrawal or general use is legally restricted. The Company reports restricted cash as other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and determines current or non-current classification based on the expected duration of the restriction. The Company reports restricted marketable securities as current or non-current marketable securities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets based on the classification of the underlying securities. Derivative Instruments and Hedging All derivative instruments are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The accounting treatment for derivative gains and losses is based on intended use and hedge designation. Gains and losses arising from amounts that are included in the assessment of cash flow hedge effectiveness are initially deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (“AOCI”) and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings, and in the same line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For options designated as cash flow hedges, the Company excludes time value from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognizes it on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge in the Consolidated Statements of Operations line item to which the hedge relates. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OCI. Gains and losses arising from amounts that are included in the assessment of fair value hedge effectiveness are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations line item to which the hedge relates along with offsetting losses and gains related to the change in value of the hedged item. For foreign exchange forward contracts designated as fair value hedges, the Company excludes the forward carry component from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognizes it in OI&E on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OCI. Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair values of derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations line items to which the derivative instruments relate. Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 35 The Company presents derivative assets and liabilities at their gross fair values in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company classifies cash flows related to derivative instruments as operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Fair Value Measurements The fair values of the Company’s money market funds and certain marketable equity securities are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. The valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of the Company’s debt instruments and all other financial instruments, which generally have counterparties with high credit ratings, are based on quoted market prices or model-driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data. Note 2 – Revenue Recognition Net sales consist of revenue from the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad, Services and other products. The Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is transferred to its customers. Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company’s Products net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company’s Services net sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable. The Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer incentive programs based on the Company’s expectations and historical experience. For arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the Company allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (“SSPs”). When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are established that reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company’s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation. The Company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud ® , Siri and Maps. The third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company’s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided. Cost of sales related to delivered hardware and bundled software, including estimated warranty costs, are recognized at the time of sale. Costs incurred to provide product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights are recognized as cost of sales as incurred. For certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For these arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized revenue, and has elected not to disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services. For the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products including, but not limited to, evaluating if it can establish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party applications sold through the App Store and certain digital content sold through the Company’s other digital content stores, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for such sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission it retains. The Company has elected to record revenue net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities, with the collected taxes recorded within other current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority. Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 36 Deferred Revenue As of September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020, the Company had total deferred revenue of $ 11.9 billion and $ 10.2 billion, respectively. As of September 25, 2021, the Company expects 64 % of total deferred revenue to be realized in less than a year, 26 % within one-to-two years, 8 % within two-to-three years and 2 % in greater than three years. Disaggregated Revenue Net sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2021, 2020 and 2019 were as follows (in millions): 2021 2020 2019 iPhone (1) $ 191,973 $ 137,781 $ 142,381 Mac (1) 35,190 28,622 25,740 iPad (1) 31,862 23,724 21,280 Wearables, Home and Accessories (1)(2) 38,367 30,620 24,482 Services (3) 68,425 53,768 46,291 Total net sales (4) $ 365,817 $ 274,515 $ 260,174 (1) Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are bundled in the sales price of the respective product. (2) Wearables, Home and Accessories net sales include sales of AirPods, Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats products, HomePod, iPod touch and accessories. (3) Services net sales include sales from the Company’s advertising, AppleCare, cloud, digital content, payment and other services. Services net sales also include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain products.

Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 38 The Company may sell certain of its marketable debt securities prior to their stated maturities for reasons including, but not limited to, managing liquidity, credit risk, duration and asset allocation. The following table shows the fair value of the Company’s non-current marketable debt securities, by contractual maturity, as of September 25, 2021 (in millions): Due after 1 year through 5 years $ 83,755 Due after 5 years through 10 years 23,915 Due after 10 years 20,207 Total fair value $ 127,877 The Company typically invests in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company’s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. Fair values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. Derivative Instruments and Hedging The Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates. Foreign Exchange Risk To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, option contracts or other instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months. To protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of September 25, 2021, the Company’s hedged term debt– and marketable securities–related foreign currency transactions are expected to be recognized within 21 years. The Company may also enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. Interest Rate Risk To protect the Company’s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. The notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments as of September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020 were as follows (in millions): 2021 2020 Derivative instruments designated as accounting hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ 76,475 $ 57,410 Interest rate contracts $ 16,875 $ 20,700 Derivative instruments not designated as accounting hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ 126,918 $ 88,636 The gross fair values of the Company’s derivative assets and liabilities were not material as of September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020. The gains and losses recognized in OCI and amounts reclassified from AOCI to net income for the Company’s derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges were not material in 2021, 2020 and 2019. Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 39 The carrying amounts of the Company’s hedged items in fair value hedges as of September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020 were as follows (in millions): 2021 2020 Hedged assets/(liabilities): Current and non-current marketable securities $ 15,954 $ 16,270 Current and non-current term debt $ ( 17,857 ) $ ( 21,033 ) The gains and losses on the Company’s derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges and the related hedged item adjustments were not material in 2021, 2020 and 2019. Accounts Receivable Trade Receivables The Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, resellers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral or third-party credit support in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements. As of both September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020, the Company had no customers that individually represented 10% or more of total trade receivables. The Company’s cellular network carriers accounted for 42 % of total trade receivables as of September 25, 2021. Vendor Non-Trade Receivables The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. As of September 25, 2021, the Company had three vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 52 %, 11 % and 11 %. As of September 26, 2020, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 57 % and 11 %.

A reconciliation of the provision for income taxes, with the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate ( 21 % in 2021, 2020 and 2019) to income before provision for income taxes for 2021, 2020 and 2019, is as follows (dollars in millions): 2021 2020 2019 Computed expected tax $ 22,933 $ 14,089 $ 13,805 State taxes, net of federal effect 1,151 423 423 Impacts of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 — ( 582 ) — Earnings of foreign subsidiaries ( 4,715 ) ( 2,534 ) ( 2,625 ) Foreign-derived intangible income deduction ( 1,372 ) ( 169 ) ( 149 ) Research and development credit, net ( 1,033 ) ( 728 ) ( 548 ) Excess tax benefits from equity awards ( 2,137 ) ( 930 ) ( 639 ) Other ( 300 ) 111 214 Provision for income taxes $ 14,527 $ 9,680 $ 10,481 Effective tax rate 13.3 % 14.4 % 15.9 % Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 41 Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities As of September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020, the significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities were (in millions): 2021 2020 Deferred tax assets: Amortization and depreciation $ 5,575 $ 8,317 Accrued liabilities and other reserves 5,895 4,934 Lease liabilities 2,406 2,038 Deferred revenue 5,399 1,638 Tax credit carryforwards 4,262 797 Other 1,639 1,612 Total deferred tax assets 25,176 19,336 Less: Valuation allowance ( 4,903 ) ( 1,041 ) Total deferred tax assets, net 20,273 18,295 Deferred tax liabilities: Minimum tax on foreign earnings 4,318 7,045 Right-of-use assets 2,167 1,862 Unrealized gains 203 526 Other 512 705 Total deferred tax liabilities 7,200 10,138 Net deferred tax assets $ 13,073 $ 8,157 Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the effects of tax credits and the future income tax effects of temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and are measured using enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The Company has elected to record certain deferred tax assets and liabilities in connection with the minimum tax on certain foreign earnings created by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Act”). As of September 25, 2021, the Company had $ 2.6 billion in foreign tax credit carryforwards in Ireland and $ 1.6 billion in California research and development credit carryforwards, both of which can be carried forward indefinitely. A valuation allowance has been recorded for the tax credit carryforwards and a portion of other temporary differences. Uncertain Tax Positions As of September 25, 2021, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $ 15.5 billion, of which $ 6.6 billion, if recognized, would impact the Company’s effective tax rate. As of September 26, 2020, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $ 16.5 billion, of which $ 8.8 billion, if recognized, would have impacted the Company’s effective tax rate. The aggregate change in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which excludes interest and penalties, for 2021, 2020 and 2019, is as follows (in millions): 2021 2020 2019 Beginning balances $ 16,475 $ 15,619 $ 9,694 Increases related to tax positions taken during a prior year 816 454 5,845 Decreases related to tax positions taken during a prior year ( 1,402 ) ( 791 ) ( 686 ) Increases related to tax positions taken during the current year 1,607 1,347 1,697 Decreases related to settlements with taxing authorities ( 1,838 ) ( 85 ) ( 852 ) Decreases related to expiration of the statute of limitations ( 181 ) ( 69 ) ( 79 ) Ending balances $ 15,477 $ 16,475 $ 15,619 The Company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and many state and foreign jurisd ictions. Tax years after 2015 for the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and after 2014 in certain major foreign jurisdictions, remain subject to examination. Although the timing of resolution and/or closure of examinations is not certain, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that its gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease in the next 12 months by as much as $ 1.2 billion. Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 42 Interest and Penalties The Company includes interest and penalties related to income tax matters within the provision for income taxes. As of September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020, the total amount of gross interest and penalties accrued was $ 1.5 billion and $ 1.4 billion, respectively. The Company recognized interest and penalty expense of $ 219 million, $ 85 million and $ 73 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. European Commission State Aid Decision On August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company (the “State Aid Decision”). The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The recovery amount was calculated to be € 13.1 billion, plus interest of € 1.2 billion. The Company and Ireland appealed the State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the “General Court”). On July 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September 25, 2020, the European Commission appealed the General Court’s decision to the European Court of Justice. The Company believes that any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision would be creditable against U.S. taxes, subject to any foreign tax credit limitations in the Act. On an annual basis, the Company may request approval from the Irish Minister for Finance to reduce the recovery amount for certain taxes paid to other countries. As of September 25, 2021, the adjusted recovery amount was € 12.7 billion, excluding interest. The adjusted recovery amount plus interest is funded into escrow, where it will remain restricted from general use pending the conclusion of all legal proceedings. Refer to the Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities section of Note 3, “Financial Instruments” for more information. Note 6 – Leases The Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including retail, corporate, manufacturing and data center space. These leases typically have original terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multiyear renewal options, some of which are reasonably certain of exercise. The Company’s lease arrangements may contain both lease and nonlease components. The Company has elected to combine and account for lease and nonlease components as a single lease component for leases of retail, corporate, and data center facilities. Payments under the Company’s lease arrangements may be fixed or variable, and variable lease payments are primarily based on purchases of output of the underlying leased assets. Lease costs associated with fixed payments on the Company’s operating leases were $ 1.7 billion and $ 1.5 billion for 2021 and 2020, respectively. Lease costs associated with variable payments on the Company’s leases were $ 12.9 billion and $ 9.3 billion for 2021 and 2020, respectively. Rent expense for operating leases, as previously reported under former lease accounting standards, was $ 1.3 billion in 2019. The Company made $ 1.4 billion and $ 1.5 billion of fixed cash payments related to operating leases in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Noncash activities involving right-of-use (“ROU”) assets obtained in exchange for lease liabilities were $ 3.3 billion for 2021 and $ 10.5 billion for 2020, including the impact of adopting FASB ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) in the first quarter of 2020. The following table shows ROU assets and lease liabilities, and the associated financial statement line items, as of September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020 (in millions): Lease-Related Assets and Liabilities Financial Statement Line Items 2021 2020 Right-of-use assets: Operating leases Other non-current assets $ 10,087 $ 8,570 Finance leases Property, plant and equipment, net 861 629 Total right-of-use assets $ 10,948 $ 9,199 Lease liabilities: Operating leases Other current liabilities $ 1,449 $ 1,436 Other non-current liabilities 9,506 7,745 Finance leases Other current liabilities 79 24 Other non-current liabilities 769 637 Total lease liabilities $ 11,803 $ 9,842 Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 43 Lease liability maturities as of September 25, 2021, are as follows (in millions): Operating Leases Finance Leases Total 2022 $ 1,629 $ 104 $ 1,733 2023 1,560 123 1,683 2024 1,499 99 1,598 2025 1,251 46 1,297 2026 1,061 26 1,087 Thereafter 5,187 868 6,055 Total undiscounted liabilities 12,187 1,266 13,453 Less: Imputed interest ( 1,232 ) ( 418 ) ( 1,650 ) Total lease liabilities $ 10,955 $ 848 $ 11,803 The weighted-average remaining lease term related to the Company’s lease liabilities as of September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020 was 10.8 years and 10.3 years, respectively. The discount rate related to the Company’s lease liabilities as of both September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020 was 2.0 %. The discount rates are generally based on estimates of the Company’s incremental borrowing rate, as the discount rates implicit in the Company’s leases cannot be readily determined. As of September 25, 2021, the Company had $ 1.1 billion of future payments under additional leases, primarily for corporate facilities and retail space, that had not yet commenced. These leases will commence between 2022 and 2023, with lease terms ranging from 3 years to 20 years.

Additionally, to manage foreign currency risk on certain of its foreign currency–denominated notes, the Company has entered into foreign currency swaps to effectively convert these notes to U.S. dollar–denominated notes. The effective interest rates for the Notes include the interest on the Notes, amortization of the discount or premium and, if applicable, adjustments related to hedging. The Company recognized $ 2.6 billion, $ 2.8 billion and $ 3.2 billion of interest expense on its term debt for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

During 2021, the Company repurchased 656 million shares of its common stock for $ 85.5 billion, including 36 million shares delivered under a $ 5.0 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement entered into in May 2021, bringing the total utilization under the Program to $ 254.1 billion as of September 25, 2021. The Program does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares. Under the Program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Shares of Common Stock The following table shows the changes in shares of common stock for 2021, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands): 2021 2020 2019 Common stock outstanding, beginning balances 16,976,763 17,772,945 19,019,943 Common stock repurchased ( 656,340 ) ( 917,270 ) ( 1,380,819 ) Common stock issued, net of shares withheld for employee taxes 106,363 121,088 133,821 Common stock outstanding, ending balances 16,426,786 16,976,763 17,772,945 Note 9 – Benefit Plans 2014 Employee Stock Plan The 2014 Employee Stock Plan (the “2014 Plan”) is a shareholder-approved plan that provides for broad-based equity grants to employees, including executive officers, and permits the granting of restricted stock units (“RSUs”), stock grants, performance-based awards, stock options and stock appreciation rights, as well as cash bonus awards. RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan generally vest over four years , based on continued employment, and are settled upon vesting in shares of the Company’s common stock on a one -for-one basis. RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan reduce the number of shares available for grant under the plan by a factor of two times the number of RSUs granted. RSUs canceled and shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations increase the number of shares available for grant under the 2014 Plan utilizing a factor of two times the number of RSUs canceled or shares withheld. All RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan have dividend equivalent rights (“DERs”), which entitle holders of RSUs to the same dividend value per share as holders of common stock. DERs are subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the underlying RSUs. As of September 25, 2021, approximately 760 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the 2014 Plan. Shares subject to outstanding awards under the 2003 Employee Stock Plan that expire, are canceled or otherwise terminate, or are withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations for RSUs, will also be available for awards under the 2014 Plan. Apple Inc. Non-Employee Director Stock Plan The Apple Inc. Non-Employee Director Stock Plan (the “Director Plan”) is a shareholder-approved plan that (i) permits the Company to grant awards of RSUs or stock options to the Company’s non-employee directors, (ii) provides for automatic initial grants of RSUs upon a non-employee director joining the Board of Directors and automatic annual grants of RSUs at each annual meeting of shareholders, and (iii) permits the Board of Directors to prospectively change the value and relative mixture of stock options and RSUs for the initial and annual award grants and the methodology for determining the number of shares of the Company’s common stock subject to these grants, in each case within the limits set forth in the Director Plan and without further shareholder approval. RSUs granted under the Director Plan reduce the number of shares available for grant under the plan by a factor of two times the number of RSUs granted. The Director Plan expires on November 12, 2027. All RSUs granted under the Director Plan are entitled to DERs, which are subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the underlying RSUs. As of September 25, 2021, approximately 4 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the Director Plan. Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans During the three months ended September 25, 2021, Section 16 officers Katherine L. Adams, Timothy D. Cook, Luca Maestri, Deirdre O’Brien and Jeffrey Williams had equity trading plans in place in accordance with Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) under the Exchange Act. An equity trading plan is a written document that preestablishes the amounts, prices and dates (or formula for determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of the Company’s stock, including shares acquired under the Company’s employee and director equity plans. Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 46 Employee Stock Purchase Plan The Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “Purchase Plan”) is a shareholder-approved plan under which substantially all employees may voluntarily enroll to purchase the Company’s common stock through payroll deductions at a price equal to 85 % of the lower of the fair market values of the stock as of the beginning or the end of six-month offering periods. An employee’s payroll deductions under the Purchase Plan are limited to 10 % of the employee’s compensation and employees may not purchase more than $ 25,000 of stock during any calendar year. As of September 25, 2021, approximately 96 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the Purchase Plan. 401(k) Plan The Company’s 401(k) Plan is a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the 401(k) Plan, participating U.S. employees may defer a portion of their pretax earnings, up to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service annual contribution limit ($ 19,500 for calendar year 2021). The Company matches 50 % to 100 % of each employee’s contributions, depending on length of service, up to a maximum of 6 % of the employee’s eligible earnings. Restricted Stock Units A summary of the Company’s RSU activity and related information for 2021, 2020 and 2019, is as follows: Number of RSUs (in thousands) Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value Per RSU Aggregate Fair Value (in millions) Balance as of September 29, 2018 368,618 $ 33.65 RSUs granted 147,409 $ 53.99 RSUs vested ( 168,350 ) $ 33.80 RSUs canceled ( 21,609 ) $ 40.71 Balance as of September 28, 2019 326,068 $ 42.30 RSUs granted 156,800 $ 59.20 RSUs vested ( 157,743 ) $ 40.29 RSUs canceled ( 14,347 ) $ 48.07 Balance as of September 26, 2020 310,778 $ 51.58 RSUs granted 89,363 $ 116.33 RSUs vested ( 145,766 ) $ 50.71 RSUs canceled ( 13,948 ) $ 68.95 Balance as of September 25, 2021 240,427 $ 75.16 $ 35,324 The fair value as of the respective vesting dates of RSUs was $ 19.0 billion, $ 10.8 billion and $ 8.6 billion for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The majority of RSUs that vested in 2021, 2020 and 2019 were net share settled such that the Company withheld shares with a value equivalent to the employees’ obligation for the applicable income and other employment taxes, and remitted the cash to the appropriate taxing authorities. The total shares withheld were approximately 53 million, 56 million and 59 million for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and were based on the value of the RSUs on their respective vesting dates as determined by the Company’s closing stock price. Total payments for the employees’ tax obligations to taxing authorities were $ 6.8 billion, $ 3.9 billion and $ 3.0 billion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Share-Based Compensation The following table shows share-based compensation expense and the related income tax benefit included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for 2021, 2020 and 2019 (in millions): 2021 2020 2019 Share-based compensation expense $ 7,906 $ 6,829 $ 6,068 Income tax benefit related to share-based compensation expense $ ( 4,056 ) $ ( 2,476 ) $ ( 1,967 ) As of September 25, 2021, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding RSUs and stock options was $ 13.6 billion, which the Company expects to recognize over a weighted-average period of 2.5 years. Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 47 Note 10 – Commitments and Contingencies Accrued Warranty and Guarantees The following table shows changes in the Company’s accrued warranties and related costs for 2021, 2020 and 2019 (in millions): 2021 2020 2019 Beginning accrued warranty and related costs $ 3,354 $ 3,570 $ 3,692 Cost of warranty claims ( 2,674 ) ( 2,956 ) ( 3,857 ) Accruals for product warranty 2,684 2,740 3,735 Ending accrued warranty and related costs $ 3,364 $ 3,354 $ 3,570 The Company offers an iPhone Upgrade Program, which is available to customers who purchase a qualifying iPhone in the U.S., the U.K. and China mainland. The iPhone Upgrade Program provides customers the right to trade in that iPhone for a specified amount when purchasing a new iPhone, provided certain conditions are met. The Company accounts for the trade-in right as a guarantee liability and recognizes arrangement revenue net of the fair value of such right, with subsequent changes to the guarantee liability recognized within net sales. Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product Although most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements. The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Substantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia, with some Mac computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland. Unconditional Purchase Obligations The Company has entered into certain off–balance sheet commitments that require the future purchase of goods or services (“unconditional purchase obligations”). The Company’s unconditional purchase obligations primarily consist of payments for content creation, Internet and telecommunications services and supplier arrangements. Future payments under noncancelable unconditional purchase obligations having a remaining term in excess of one year as of September 25, 2021, are as follows (in millions): 2022 $ 4,551 2023 2,165 2024 984 2025 405 2026 51 Thereafter 28 Total $ 8,184 Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 48 Contingencies The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully resolved. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. When a loss related to a legal proceeding or claim is probable and reasonably estimable, the Company accrues its best estimate for the ultimate resolution of the matter. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims, except for the following matters: VirnetX VirnetX, Inc. (“VirnetX”) filed a lawsuit against the Company alleging that certain of the Company’s products infringe on patents owned by VirnetX. On April 11, 2018, a jury returned a verdict against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas (the “Eastern Texas District Court”). The Company appealed the verdict to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which remanded the case back to the Eastern Texas District Court, where a retrial was held in October 2020. The jury returned a verdict against the Company and awarded damages of $ 503 million, which the Company has appealed. The Company has challenged the validity of the patents at issue in the retrial at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the “PTO”), and the PTO has declared the patents invalid, subject to further appeal by VirnetX. iOS Performance Management Cases On April 5, 2018, several U.S. federal actions alleging violation of consumer protection laws, fraud, computer intrusion and other causes of action related to the Company’s performance management feature used in its iPhone operating systems, introduced to certain iPhones in iOS updates 10.2.1 and 11.2, were consolidated through a Multidistrict Litigation process into a single action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the “Northern California District Court”). On February 28, 2020, the parties in the Multidistrict Litigation reached a settlement to resolve the U.S. federal and California state class actions. On March 18, 2021, the Northern California District Court granted final approval of the Multidistrict Litigation settlement, which will result in an aggregate payment of $ 310 million to settle all claims. The Company continues to believe that its iPhones were not defective, that the performance management feature introduced with iOS updates 10.2.1 and 11.2 was intended to, and did, improve customers’ user experience, and that the Company did not make any misleading statements or fail to disclose any material information. French Competition Authority On March 16, 2020, the French Competition Authority (“FCA”) announced its decision that aspects of the Company’s sales and distribution practices in France violate French competition law, and issued a fine of € 1.1 billion. The Company strongly disagrees with the FCA’s decision, and has appealed. Optis Optis Wireless Technology, LLC and related entities (“Optis”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas against the Company alleging that certain of the Company’s products infringe on patents owned by Optis. On August 11, 2020, a jury returned a verdict against the Company and awarded damages. In post-trial proceedings, the damages portion of the verdict was set aside. A retrial on damages was held in August 2021 and the jury in that proceeding awarded damages of $ 300 million against the Company, which the Company plans to appeal. Note 11 – Segment Information and Geographic Data The Company reports segment information based on the “management” approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company’s reportable segments. The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described in Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.” Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 49 The Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company’s retail stores located in those geographic locations. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the reportable segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as research and development, corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges and other separately managed general and administrative costs. The Company does not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes. The following table shows information by reportable segment for 2021, 2020 and 2019 (in millions): 2021 2020 2019 Americas: Net sales $ 153,306 $ 124,556 $ 116,914 Operating income $ 53,382 $ 37,722 $ 35,099 Europe: Net sales $ 89,307 $ 68,640 $ 60,288 Operating income $ 32,505 $ 22,170 $ 19,195 Greater China: Net sales $ 68,366 $ 40,308 $ 43,678 Operating income $ 28,504 $ 15,261 $ 16,232 Japan: Net sales $ 28,482 $ 21,418 $ 21,506 Operating income $ 12,798 $ 9,279 $ 9,369 Rest of Asia Pacific: Net sales $ 26,356 $ 19,593 $ 17,788 Operating income $ 9,817 $ 6,808 $ 6,055 A reconciliation of the Company’s segment operating income to the Consolidated Statements of Operations for 2021, 2020 and 2019 is as follows (in millions): 2021 2020 2019 Segment operating income $ 137,006 $ 91,240 $ 85,950 Research and development expense ( 21,914 ) ( 18,752 ) ( 16,217 ) Other corporate expenses, net ( 6,143 ) ( 6,200 ) ( 5,803 ) Total operating income $ 108,949 $ 66,288 $ 63,930 Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 50 The U.S. and China were the only countries that accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s net sales in 2021, 2020 and 2019. There was no single customer that accounted for more than 10% of net sales in 2021, 2020 and 2019. Net sales for 2021, 2020 and 2019 and long-lived assets as of September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020 were as follows (in millions): 2021 2020 2019 Net sales: U.S. $ 133,803 $ 109,197 $ 102,266 China (1) 68,366 40,308 43,678 Other countries 163,648 125,010 114,230 Total net sales $ 365,817 $ 274,515 $ 260,174 2021 2020 Long-lived assets: U.S. $ 28,203 $ 25,890 China (1) 7,521 7,256 Other countries 3,716 3,620 Total long-lived assets $ 39,440 $ 36,766 (1) China includes Hong Kong and Taiwan.

Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 51 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Apple Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Apple Inc. as of September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 25, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Apple Inc. at September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 25, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the “PCAOB”), Apple Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 25, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated October 28, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of Apple Inc.’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Apple Inc.’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Apple Inc. in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates. Uncertain Tax Positions Description of the Matter As discussed in Note 5 to the financial statements, Apple Inc. is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and many state and foreign jurisdictions. As of September 25, 2021, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $15.5 billion, of which $6.6 billion, if recognized, would impact Apple Inc.’s effective tax rate. Apple Inc. uses significant judgment in the calculation of tax liabilities in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of technical merits and complex tax laws. Auditing management’s evaluation of whether an uncertain tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and the measurement of the benefit of various tax positions can be complex, involves significant judgment, and is based on interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings. Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 52 How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We tested controls relating to the evaluation of uncertain tax positions, including controls over management’s assessment as to whether tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained, management’s process to measure the benefit of its tax positions, and the development of the related disclosures. To evaluate Apple Inc.’s assessment of which tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained, our audit procedures included, among others, reading and evaluating management’s assumptions and analysis, and, as applicable, Apple Inc.’s communications with taxing authorities, that detailed the basis and technical merits of the uncertain tax positions. We involved our tax subject matter resources in assessing the technical merits of certain of Apple Inc.’s tax positions based on our knowledge of relevant tax laws and experience with related taxing authorities. For certain tax positions, we also received external legal counsel confirmation letters and discussed the matters with external advisors and Apple Inc. tax personnel. In addition, we evaluated Apple Inc.’s disclosure in relation to these matters included in Note 5 to the financial statements. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP We have served as Apple Inc.’s auditor since 2009. San Jose, California October 28, 2021 Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 53 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Apple Inc. Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have audited Apple Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 25, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the “COSO criteria”). In our opinion, Apple Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 25, 2021, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the “PCAOB”), the consolidated balance sheets of Apple Inc. as of September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 25, 2021, and the related notes and our report dated October 28, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion Apple Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Apple Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Apple Inc. in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP San Jose, California October 28, 2021 Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 54 Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure None. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act were effective as of September 25, 2021 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Inherent Limitations over Internal Controls The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company’s assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that the Company’s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company’s management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company’s internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on the Company’s assessment, management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 25, 2021 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, which appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2021, which were identified in connection with management’s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 55 Item 9B. Other Information Disclosure Pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act Under Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act, the Company is required to disclose in its periodic reports if it or any of its affiliates knowingly conducted a transaction or dealing with entities or individuals designated pursuant to certain Executive Orders. On March 2, 2021, the U.S. Secretary of State designated the Russian Federal Security Service (the “FSB”) as a blocked party under Executive Order 13382. On the same day, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control updated General License No. 1B to authorize transactions and activities with the FSB that are necessary and ordinarily incident to requesting, receiving, utilizing, paying for, or dealing in certain licenses, permits, certifications or notifications issued or registered by the FSB for the importation, distribution or use of certain information technology products in the Russian Federation. As previously disclosed in the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three-month period ended June 26, 2021, during such period, the Company filed legally required administrative notifications with the FSB in connection with the importation of the Company’s products into the Russian Federation, as permitted by General License No. 1B. The Company did not make any payments, nor did it receive gross revenues or net profits, in connection with such engagement. The Company may in the future engage with the FSB for activities necessary to conduct business in the Russian Federation, in accordance with applicable U.S. laws and regulations. Item 9C.

Markets and Distribution The Company’s customers are primarily in the consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise and government markets. The Company sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. The Company also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels, such as third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. During 2020, the Company’s net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 34% and 66%, respectively, of total net sales. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales in 2020, 2019 and 2018. Competition The markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive, and are characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. Many of the Company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by emulating the Company’s products and infringing on its intellectual property. The Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service features (including security features), relative price and performance, product and service quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and accessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, and corporate reputation. Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 2 The Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets and other electronic devices and services. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software, and service offerings with large customer bases. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors may have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company’s services compete with business models that provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company expects competition in these markets to intensify significantly as competitors imitate the Company’s product features and applications within their products, or collaborate to offer integrated solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. Supply of Components Although most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets and other electronic devices. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements. The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Substantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia, with some Mac computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland. Research and Development Because the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through research and development (“R&D”), licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology. Intellectual Property The Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices, accessories, software and services. This includes patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade dress and other forms of intellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although the Company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel. The Company regularly files patent applications to protect innovations arising from its research, development and design, and is currently pursuing thousands of patent applications around the world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued patents, including utility patents, design patents and others. The Company also holds copyrights relating to certain aspects of its products and services. No single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company’s products. The Company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products. In addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the Company’s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of the Company’s products, processes and services. While the Company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all. Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 3 Business Seasonality and Product Introductions The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction. Employees As of September 26, 2020, the Company had approximately 147,000 full-time equivalent employees. Available Information The Company’s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to reports filed pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).

Risk Factors The following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. These risk factors may be important to understanding other statements in this Form 10-K. The following information should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K. The business, financial condition and operating results of the Company can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described below, any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly, cause the Company’s actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from past, or from anticipated future, financial condition and operating results. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, operating results and stock price. Because of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company’s financial condition and operating results, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. The Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price have been adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 has spread rapidly throughout the world, prompting governments and businesses to take unprecedented measures in response. Such measures have included restrictions on travel and business operations, temporary closures of businesses, and quarantines and shelter-in-place orders. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets. The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have adversely affected and could in the future materially adversely impact the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. Following the initial outbreak of the virus, the Company experienced disruptions to its manufacturing, supply chain and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, resulting in temporary iPhone supply shortages that affected sales worldwide. During the course of the pandemic, the Company’s retail stores, as well as channel partner points of sale, have been temporarily closed at various times. In many cases, where stores and points of sale have reopened they are subject to operating restrictions to protect public health and the health and safety of employees and customers. The Company has at times required substantially all of its employees to work remotely. The Company is continuing to monitor the situation and take appropriate actions in accordance with the recommendations and requirements of relevant authorities. The full extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s operational and financial performance is currently uncertain and will depend on many factors outside the Company’s control, including, without limitation, the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic, the development and availability of effective treatments and vaccines, the imposition of and compliance with protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products. Additional future impacts on the Company may include, but are not limited to, material adverse effects on: demand for the Company’s products and services; the Company’s supply chain and sales and distribution channels; the Company’s ability to execute its strategic plans; and the Company’s profitability and cost structure. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. Global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and growth. The Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’s total net sales. In addition, a majority of the Company’s supply chain, and its manufacturing and assembly activities, are located outside the U.S. As a result, the Company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions. Adverse macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, slower growth or recession, new or increased tariffs and other barriers to trade, changes to fiscal and monetary policy, tighter credit, higher interest rates, high unemployment and currency fluctuations could materially adversely affect demand for the Company’s products and services. In addition, consumer confidence and spending could be adversely affected in response to financial market volatility, negative financial news, conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets, declines in income or asset values, changes to fuel and other energy costs, labor and healthcare costs and other economic factors. Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 5 In addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company’s products, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic conditions could have a significant impact on the Company’s suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners. Potential effects include financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance operations and purchases of the Company’s products; and insolvency. A downturn in the economic environment could also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company’s trade receivables; the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the Company’s ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair value of the Company’s financial instruments. These and other economic factors could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and growth. Global markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets. The Company’s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. The Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in R&D. There can be no assurance that these investments will achieve expected returns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully. The Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to register, numerous patents, trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by emulating the Company’s products and infringing on its intellectual property. Effective intellectual property protection may not be consistently available in every country in which the Company operates. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the Company’s intellectual property, the Company’s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be adversely affected. The Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors may have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. Some of the markets in which the Company competes have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall. Additionally, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company’s product features and applications within their products or collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the Company’s approach to providing components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions. The Company’s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company’s financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the Company’s ability to continually improve its products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively. Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 6 To remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services. Due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services, and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services. The success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors including, but not limited to, timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company’s ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for new products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies. Accordingly, the Company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product and service introductions and transitions. The Company depends on the performance of carriers, wholesalers, retailers and other resellers. The Company distributes its products through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers, many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers. The Company also sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. Some carriers providing cellular network service for iPhone offer financing, installment payment plans or subsidies for users’ purchases of the device. There is no assurance that such offers will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the Company’s agreements with these carriers or in agreements the Company enters into with new carriers. The Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers’ stores with Company employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays. These programs can require a substantial investment while not assuring return or incremental sales. The financial condition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Company’s products, or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the Company’s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company’s products. The Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk. The Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers’ facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable, no assurance can be given that the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes. The Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. Manufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company’s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for periods up to 150 days. Because the Company’s markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments. Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 7 Future operating results depend upon the Company’s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms. Because the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that could materially adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and operating results. While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms. The effects of global or regional economic conditions on the Company’s suppliers, described in “ Global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and growth, ” above, also could affect the Company’s ability to obtain components . Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results. The Company’s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements. If the Company’s supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company’s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. The Company’s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. The Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of which are located outside of the U.S. Substantially all of the Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia. A significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements can lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company’s direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished control may have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products or services, or the Company’s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect liability. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, material violations of the supplier code of conduct could occur. The Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many components, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company’s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can have a negative impact on the Company’s cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, military actions, economic, business, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, or international trade disputes. The Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be reduced or terminated, and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted. Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 8 The Company’s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the Company’s business and result in harm to the Company’s reputation. The Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the Company, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products. Defects can also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects could make the Company’s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the Company’s products are introduced into specialized applications, including healthcare. In addition, the Company’s service offerings may have quality issues and from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, the Company’s services may not perform as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software and services it offers. Failure to do so could result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the Company’s products and services. In addition, the Company can be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property, plant and equipment, and/or intangible assets, and significant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems can also adversely affect the experience for users of the Company’s products and services, and result in harm to the Company’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales. The Company relies on access to third-party digital content, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell currently available content. The licensing or other distribution arrangements with these third parties are for relatively short terms and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and can take actions to make it more difficult or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content in the future. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company’s access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules, or continue to expand its geographic reach. Failure to obtain the right to make third-party digital content available, or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results. Some third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. If requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There is no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner. In addition, certain countries have passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force the Company to license its digital rights management, which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could negatively affect arrangements with the Company’s content providers. The Company’s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers. The Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications and services. There is no assurance that third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the Company’s products. If third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company’s products, customers may choose not to buy the Company’s products. The Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers’ perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the Company’s products compared to competitors’ platforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets and Windows for personal computers. This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of product sales, and the costs of developing such applications and services. The Company’s minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets could make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company’s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors’ products with larger market share. If developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company’s devices may suffer. Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 9 The Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products. The Company’s products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and if third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, third-party applications might not take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences or might not operate correctly and may result in dissatisfied customers. The Company sells and delivers third-party applications for its products through the App Store. For the vast majority of applications, developers keep all of the revenue they generate on the App Store. The Company only retains a commission from sales of applications through its platforms and in situations where a developer offers purchases for digital features, services, or goods within an application. If developers reduce their use of the Company’s platforms, including in-app purchases, then the volume of sales, and the commission that the Company earns on those sales, would decrease. If the rate of the commission that the Company retains on such sales is reduced, or if it is otherwise narrowed in scope or eliminated, the Company’s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. The Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Many of the Company’s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties, which requires licenses from those third parties. In addition, because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company currently competes or in the future may compete, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, the Company’s products and services may unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Based on experience and industry practice, the Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. There is, however, no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, could preclude the Company from selling certain products or services, or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results. The Company’s financial condition and operating results could be adversely impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings or government investigations. The Company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved, and new matters may arise in the future. In addition, agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which can subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. The number of claims, legal proceedings and government investigations involving the Company, and the alleged magnitude of such claims, proceedings and government investigations, has generally increased over time and may continue to increase. The Company has faced and continues to face a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled products, and new claims may arise in the future. For example, technology and other patent-holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in several U.S. jurisdictions, as well as internationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages. Regardless of the merit of particular claims, defending against litigation or responding to government investigations can be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the Company’s operations and distracting to management. In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such challenges. No assurance can be given that such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These agreements may also significantly increase the Company’s cost of sales and operating expenses. Except as described in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, “Commitments and Contingencies” under the heading “Contingencies,” in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims, including matters related to infringement of intellectual property rights. The outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome could result in significant compensatory, punitive or trebled monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company, and could require the Company to change its business practices or limit the Company’s ability to offer certain products and services, all of which could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results. While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise. Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 10 The Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects on the Company’s business. The Company’s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects including, but not limited to: antitrust; privacy, data security and data localization; consumer protection; advertising, sales, billing and e-commerce; product liability; intellectual property ownership and infringement; digital platforms; Internet, telecommunications, and mobile communications; media, television, film and digital content; availability of third-party software applications and services; labor and employment; anti-corruption; import, export and trade; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; anti–money laundering; foreign ownership and investment; tax; and environmental, health and safety. Compliance with these laws and regulations may be onerous and expensive, increasing the cost of conducting the Company’s global operations. Changes to laws and regulations can adversely affect the Company’s business by increasing the Company’s costs, limiting the Company’s ability to offer a product or service to customers, requiring changes to the Company’s supply chain and business practices or otherwise making the Company’s products and services less attractive to customers. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that the Company’s employees, contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company’s policies and procedures. If the Company is found to have violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect the Company’s reputation, financial condition and operating results. The technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and regulatory scrutiny, which exposes the Company to government investigations, legal actions and penalties. For example, the Company is subject to antitrust investigations in various jurisdictions around the world, which can result in legal proceedings and claims against the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results. In addition, if enacted, legislative and other proposals to further regulate technology companies could result in changes to the Company’s business, including requiring the Company to modify its product and service offerings, limiting the Company’s ability to invest in strategic acquisitions, or affecting the Company’s business relationships with other technology companies, and could have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results. Further, the Company’s business partners are or may become subject to litigation that, if resolved against them, could affect the Company’s relationships with these business partners and have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results. There can be no assurance that the Company’s business will not be materially adversely affected, individually or in the aggregate, by the outcomes of such investigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future. The Company’s retail stores have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. The Company’s retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory and personnel. The Company also has entered into substantial lease commitments for retail space. Certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than the Company’s more typical retail stores. Due to the high cost structure associated with the Company’s retail stores, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of an individual store or multiple stores, including as a result of protective public safety measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance costs. The Company’s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the Company’s financial condition and operating results, including macro-economic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity. Other factors include, but are not limited to, the Company’s ability to: manage costs associated with retail store construction and operation; manage relationships with existing retail partners; manage costs associated with fluctuations in the value of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost. Investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company’s ongoing business, present risks not originally contemplated and adversely affect the Company’s reputation, financial condition and operating results. The Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater-than-expected liabilities and expenses, economic, political, legal and regulatory challenges associated with operating in new businesses, regions or countries, inadequate return on capital, potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets, and significant write-offs. These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful. The failure of any significant investment could adversely affect the Company’s reputation, financial condition and operating results. Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 11 The Company’s business and reputation may be impacted by information technology system failures or network disruptions. The Company is exposed to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, or other events or disruptions. System redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company’s business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions can adversely impact the Company’s business by, among other things, preventing access to the Company’s online services, interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the Company’s products. These events could materially adversely affect the Company’s reputation, financial condition and operating results. There may be losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personally identifiable information, that could subject the Company to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences. The Company’s business requires it to use and store confidential information including, among other things, personally identifiable information (“PII”) with respect to the Company’s customers and employees. The Company devotes significant resources to network and data security, including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data. But these measures cannot provide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the Company’s reputation, financial condition and operating results. The Company’s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties. Although the Company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to third parties, such measures are not always effective and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the Company’s reputation, financial condition and operating results. For example, the Company may experience a security breach impacting the Company’s information technology systems that compromises the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential information. Such an incident could, among other things, impair the Company’s ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services, impact the Company’s stock price, materially damage supplier relationships, and expose the Company to litigation or government investigations, which could result in penalties, fines or judgments against the Company. Although malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information, including PII, affect many companies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and processes. The Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data, including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies. As with all companies, these security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty password management or other irregularities. For example, third parties fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names, passwords or other sensitive information, which may, in turn, be used to access the Company’s information technology systems. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, may result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the Company’s products and services. In addition to the risks relating to general confidential information described above, the Company is also subject to specific obligations relating to health data and payment card data. Health data is subject to additional privacy, security and breach notification requirements, and the Company can be subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the Company’s compliance with these obligations. If the Company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements, or if health data is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the Company’s agreements with healthcare institutions, the Company could be subject to litigation or government investigations, may be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and could also incur significant fees or fines. Under payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder information is potentially compromised, the Company could be liable for associated investigatory expenses and could also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards. The Company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards, which would materially adversely affect the Company’s reputation, financial condition and operating results. While the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise. Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 12 The Company’s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding data protection. The Company is subject to federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of PII. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also may restrict transfers of PII among the Company and its international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the Company to incur substantial costs or require the Company to change its business practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability. The Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of PII through its privacy policy, information provided on its website and press statements. Any failure by the Company to comply with these public statements or with other federal, state or international privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. In addition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability. The Company’s success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key personnel. Much of the Company’s future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly skilled employees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley, where most of the Company’s key personnel are located. The Company’s business can be impacted by political events, international trade disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions. Political events, international trade disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions could harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners. The Company has a large, global business, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. International trade disputes can result in tariffs, sanctions, and other measures that restrict international trade and can adversely affect the Company’s business. For example, tensions between the U.S. and China have led to a series of tariffs being imposed by the U.S. on imports from China mainland, as well as other business restrictions. Tariffs may increase the cost of the Company’s products and the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs adversely impact the gross margin that the Company earns on its products. Tariffs can also make the Company’s products more expensive for customers, which could make the Company’s products less competitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also adopt other measures, such as controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, that could adversely impact the Company’s operations and supply chain and limit the Company’s ability to offer its products and services as designed. These measures can require the Company to take various actions, including change suppliers, restructure business relationships, and stop offering third-party applications on its platforms. Changing the Company’s operations in accordance with new or changed trade restrictions may be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the Company’s operations and distracting to management. Trade restrictions may be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. Political uncertainty surrounding international trade disputes could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company’s business. Many of the Company’s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company’s suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, labor disputes, public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company’s control. Global climate change could result in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Such events could make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company’s supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company’s service offerings. Following an interruption to its business, the Company could require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company. Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 13 The Company’s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While the Company’s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in disruption to the Company’s business and harm to the Company’s reputation. Major public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the future adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products; the imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement of products between regions; and disruptions in the Company’s supply chain and sales and distribution channels, resulting in interruptions of the supply of current products and delays in production ramps of new products. While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise. The Company expects its quarterly net sales and operating results to fluctuate. The Company’s profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For example, the gross margins on the Company’s products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The Company’s gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in response to such pressures; increased competition; the Company’s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering content for the Company’s services; the Company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; and the introduction of new products or services, including new products or services with higher cost structures. These and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results. The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company’s products or services, issues with new product or service introductions, information technology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company’s logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners. The Company’s stock price is subject to volatility. The Company’s stock price has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, the Company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies’ operating performance. Price volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its stock to exceed the stock’s price at a given point in time. The Company believes its stock price should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability. The Company also believes its stock price should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow, and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Company’s Board of Directors, and the Company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, its stock price may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention. The Company’s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies. The Company’s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non–U.S. dollar–denominated sales, cost of sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company’s products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company’s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar’s strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency–denominated sales. Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 14 Conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Company’s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins. The Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place. The Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio. The Company’s investments can be negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and economic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results. The Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen. The Company distributes its products through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. The Company also sells its products directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the Company’s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant portion of the Company’s trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers. The Company’s exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September 26, 2020, the Company’s vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses. The Company could be subject to changes in its tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. The Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland, where a number of the Company’s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. The Company’s effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including in the U.S. and Ireland. The Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company’s effective tax rates were to increase, particularly in the U.S. or Ireland, or if the ultimate determination of the Company’s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company’s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. Item 2. Properties The Company’s headquarters are located in Cupertino, California. As of September 26, 2020, the Company owned or leased facilities and land for corporate functions, R&D, data centers, retail and other purposes at locations throughout the U.S. and in various places outside the U.S. The Company believes its existing facilities and equipment, which are used by all reportable segments, are in good operating condition and are suitable for the conduct of its business. Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 15 Item 3. Legal Proceedings The Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The Company’s material legal proceedings are described in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, “Commitments and Contingencies” under the heading “Contingencies.” The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. The Company settled certain matters during the fourth quarter of 2020 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating results. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures Not applicable. Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 16 PART II Item 5.

The remaining $56.4 billion in the table represents the amount available to repurchase shares under the authorized repurchase program as of September 26, 2020. The Company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. Under this program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act. (2) In May 2020, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase arrangement (“ASR”) to purchase up to $6.0 billion of the Company’s common stock.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This section of this Form 10-K generally discusses 2020 and 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019. Discussions of 2018 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2019. Fiscal Year Highlights COVID-19 Update COVID-19 has spread rapidly throughout the world, prompting governments and businesses to take unprecedented measures in response. Such measures have included restrictions on travel and business operations, temporary closures of businesses, and quarantines and shelter-in-place orders. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets. The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have adversely affected and could in the future materially adversely impact the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. During 2020, aspects of the Company’s business were adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with many of the Company’s retail stores, as well as channel partner points of sale, temporarily closed at various times, and the vast majority of the Company’s employees working remotely. The Company has reopened some of its offices and the majority of its retail stores, subject to operating restrictions to protect public health and the health and safety of employees and customers, and it continues to work on safely re-opening the remainder of its offices and retail stores, subject to local rules and regulations. The full extent of the future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s operational and financial performance is currently uncertain and will depend on many factors outside the Company’s control, including, without limitation, the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic, the development and availability of effective treatments and vaccines, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products. Refer to Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors,” for more information. The Company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, along with commercial paper and other short-term liquidity arrangements, will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital asset purchases, dividends, share repurchases, debt repayments and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations. Fiscal 2020 Highlights Total net sales increased 6% or $14.3 billion during 2020 compared to 2019, primarily driven by higher net sales of Services and Wearables, Home and Accessories. The weakness in foreign currencies had an unfavorable impact on net sales during 2020. In April 2020, the Company announced an increase to its current share repurchase program authorization from $175 billion to $225 billion and raised its quarterly dividend from $0.1925 to $0.205 per share beginning in May 2020. During 2020, the Company repurchased $72.5 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $14.1 billion. On August 28, 2020, the Company effected a four-for-one stock split to shareholders of record as of August 24, 2020. All share, RSU and per share or per RSU information has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split. Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 20 Products and Services Performance The following table shows net sales by category for 2020, 2019 and 2018 (dollars in millions): 2020 Change 2019 Change 2018 Net sales by category: iPhone (1) $ 137,781 (3) % $ 142,381 (14) % $ 164,888 Mac (1) 28,622 11 % 25,740 2 % 25,198 iPad (1) 23,724 11 % 21,280 16 % 18,380 Wearables, Home and Accessories (1)(2) 30,620 25 % 24,482 41 % 17,381 Services (3) 53,768 16 % 46,291 16 % 39,748 Total net sales $ 274,515 6 % $ 260,174 (2) % $ 265,595 (1) Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are bundled in the sales price of the respective product. (2) Wearables, Home and Accessories net sales include sales of AirPods, Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats products, HomePod, iPod touch and Apple-branded and third-party accessories. (3) Services net sales include sales from the Company’s advertising, AppleCare, digital content and other services. Services net sales also include amortization of the deferred value of Maps, Siri, and free iCloud ® storage and Apple TV+ services, which are bundled in the sales price of certain products. iPhone iPhone net sales decreased during 2020 compared to 2019 due primarily to the absence of new iPhone models in the fourth quarter of 2020 and the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, partially offset by the introduction of iPhone SE in the third quarter of 2020. Mac Mac net sales increased during 2020 compared to 2019 due primarily to higher net sales of MacBook Pro. iPad iPad net sales increased during 2020 compared to 2019 due primarily to higher net sales of 10-inch versions of iPad, iPad Air and iPad Pro. Wearables, Home and Accessories Wearables, Home and Accessories net sales increased during 2020 compared to 2019 due primarily to higher net sales of AirPods and Apple Watch. Services Services net sales increased during 2020 compared to 2019 due primarily to higher net sales from the App Store, advertising and cloud services. Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 21 Segment Operating Performance The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. Further information regarding the Company’s reportable segments can be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 11, “Segment Information and Geographic Data.” The following table shows net sales by reportable segment for 2020, 2019 and 2018 (dollars in millions): 2020 Change 2019 Change 2018 Net sales by reportable segment: Americas $ 124,556 7 % $ 116,914 4 % $ 112,093 Europe 68,640 14 % 60,288 (3) % 62,420 Greater China 40,308 (8) % 43,678 (16) % 51,942 Japan 21,418 — % 21,506 (1) % 21,733 Rest of Asia Pacific 19,593 10 % 17,788 2 % 17,407 Total net sales $ 274,515 6 % $ 260,174 (2) % $ 265,595 Americas Americas net sales increased during 2020 compared to 2019 due primarily to higher net sales of Services and Wearables, Home and Accessories. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable impact on Americas net sales during 2020. Europe Europe net sales increased during 2020 compared to 2019 due primarily to higher net sales of iPhone, Wearables, Home and Accessories and Services. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable impact on Europe net sales during 2020. Greater China Greater China net sales decreased during 2020 compared to 2019 due primarily to lower net sales of iPhone, partially offset by higher net sales of Services and iPad. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable impact on Greater China net sales during 2020. Japan Japan net sales were flat during 2020 compared to 2019 due primarily to lower net sales of iPhone, offset by higher net sales of Services and Wearables, Home and Accessories. The strength of the Japanese yen relative to the U.S. dollar had a favorable impact on Japan net sales during 2020. Rest of Asia Pacific Rest of Asia Pacific net sales increased during 2020 compared to 2019 due primarily to higher net sales of Wearables, Home and Accessories, Services and iPhone. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable impact on Rest of Asia Pacific net sales during 2020. Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 22 Gross Margin Products and Services gross margin and gross margin percentage for 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows (dollars in millions): 2020 2019 2018 Gross margin: Products $ 69,461 $ 68,887 $ 77,683 Services 35,495 29,505 24,156 Total gross margin $ 104,956 $ 98,392 $ 101,839 Gross margin percentage: Products 31.5 % 32.2 % 34.4 % Services 66.0 % 63.7 % 60.8 % Total gross margin percentage 38.2 % 37.8 % 38.3 % Products Gross Margin Products gross margin increased during 2020 compared to 2019 due primarily to higher Products volume and material cost savings, partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and a different Products mix. Products gross margin percentage decreased during 2020 compared to 2019 due primarily to the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and a different Products mix, partially offset by material cost savings and higher leverage. Services Gross Margin Services gross margin increased during 2020 compared to 2019 due primarily to higher Services net sales and a different Services mix. Services gross margin percentage increased during 2020 compared to 2019 due primarily to a different Services mix and higher leverage, partially offset by higher Services costs. The Company’s future gross margins can be impacted by a variety of factors, as set forth in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.” As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and remain under downward pressure. Operating Expenses Operating expenses for 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows (dollars in millions): 2020 Change 2019 Change 2018 Research and development $ 18,752 16 % $ 16,217 14 % $ 14,236 Percentage of total net sales 7 % 6 % 5 % Selling, general and administrative $ 19,916 9 % $ 18,245 9 % $ 16,705 Percentage of total net sales 7 % 7 % 6 % Total operating expenses $ 38,668 12 % $ 34,462 11 % $ 30,941 Percentage of total net sales 14 % 13 % 12 % Research and Development The year-over-year growth in R&D expense in 2020 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses. The Company continues to believe that focused investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace, and to the development of new and updated products and services that are central to the Company’s core business strategy. Selling, General and Administrative The year-over-year growth in selling, general and administrative expense in 2020 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses, higher spending on marketing and advertising, and higher variable selling expenses. Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 23 Other Income/(Expense), Net Other income/(expense), net (“OI&E”) for 2020, 2019 and 2018 was as follows (dollars in millions): 2020 Change 2019 Change 2018 Interest and dividend income $ 3,763 $ 4,961 $ 5,686 Interest expense (2,873) (3,576) (3,240) Other income/(expense), net (87) 422 (441) Total other income/(expense), net $ 803 (56) % $ 1,807 (10) % $ 2,005 The year-over-year decrease in OI&E during 2020 was due primarily to lower interest income and net impairment/gain activity on non-marketable securities, partially offset by lower interest expense. The weighted-average interest rate earned by the Company on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was 1.85% and 2.19% in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows (dollars in millions): 2020 2019 2018 Provision for income taxes $ 9,680 $ 10,481 $ 13,372 Effective tax rate 14.4 % 15.9 % 18.3 % Statutory federal income tax rate 21 % 21 % 24.5 % The Company’s effective tax rate for both 2020 and 2019 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to the lower tax rate on foreign earnings, including the impact of tax settlements, and tax benefits from share-based compensation. The Company’s effective tax rate for 2020 was lower compared to 2019 due primarily to a one-time adjustment of U.S. foreign tax credits in response to regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in December 2019 in connection with the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Act”) and higher tax benefits from share-based compensation. As of September 26, 2020, the Company had net deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences and tax credits of $11.0 billion and deferred tax liabilities of $2.8 billion. Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to recover the net deferred tax assets. The Company will continue to evaluate the amount of the valuation allowance, if any, by assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Financial Instruments In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“ASU 2016-13”), which modifies the measurement of expected credit losses on certain financial instruments. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-13 in its first quarter of 2021 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. Based on the composition of the Company’s investment portfolio, current market conditions, and historical credit loss activity, the adoption of ASU 2016-13 will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 24 Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table presents selected financial information and statistics as of and for the years ended September 26, 2020, September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018 (in millions): 2020 2019 2018 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities (1) $ 191,830 $ 205,898 $ 237,100 Property, plant and equipment, net $ 36,766 $ 37,378 $ 41,304 Commercial paper $ 4,996 $ 5,980 $ 11,964 Total term debt $ 107,440 $ 102,067 $ 102,519 Working capital $ 38,321 $ 57,101 $ 15,410 Cash generated by operating activities $ 80,674 $ 69,391 $ 77,434 Cash generated by/(used in) investing activities $ (4,289) $ 45,896 $ 16,066 Cash used in financing activities $ (86,820) $ (90,976) $ (87,876) (1) As of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, total marketable securities included $18.6 billion and $18.9 billion, respectively, that was restricted from general use, related to the State Aid Decision (refer to Note 5, “Income Taxes” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) and other agreements. The Company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, along with commercial paper and other short-term liquidity arrangements, will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital asset purchases, dividends, share repurchases, debt repayments and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months. In connection with the State Aid Decision, as of September 26, 2020, the adjusted recovery amount of €12.9 billion plus interest of €1.2 billion was funded into escrow, where it will remain restricted from general use pending the conclusion of all legal proceedings. Further information regarding the State Aid Decision can be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 5, “Income Taxes.” The Company’s marketable securities investment portfolio is primarily invested in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company’s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. During 2020, cash generated by operating activities of $80.7 billion was a result of $57.4 billion of net income, non-cash adjustments to net income of $17.6 billion and an increase in the net change in operating assets and liabilities of $5.7 billion. Cash used in investing activities of $4.3 billion during 2020 consisted primarily of cash used to acquire property, plant and equipment of $7.3 billion and cash paid for business acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of $1.5 billion, partially offset by proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities, net of purchases, of $5.5 billion. Cash used in financing activities of $86.8 billion during 2020 consisted primarily of cash used to repurchase common stock of $72.4 billion, cash used to pay dividends and dividend equivalents of $14.1 billion, cash used to repay or redeem term debt of $12.6 billion and net repayments of commercial paper of $1.0 billion, partially offset by net proceeds from the issuance of term debt of $16.1 billion. During 2019, cash generated by operating activities of $69.4 billion was a result of $55.3 billion of net income and non-cash adjustments to net income of $17.6 billion, partially offset by a decrease in the net change in operating assets and liabilities of $3.5 billion. Cash generated by investing activities of $45.9 billion during 2019 consisted primarily of proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities, net of purchases, of $57.5 billion, partially offset by cash used to acquire property, plant and equipment of $10.5 billion. Cash used in financing activities of $91.0 billion during 2019 consisted primarily of cash used to repurchase common stock of $66.9 billion, cash used to pay dividends and dividend equivalents of $14.1 billion, cash used to repay term debt of $8.8 billion and net repayments of commercial paper of $6.0 billion, partially offset by net proceeds from the issuance of term debt of $7.0 billion. Debt The Company issues unsecured short-term promissory notes (“Commercial Paper”) pursuant to a commercial paper program. The Company uses the net proceeds from the commercial paper program for general corporate purposes, including dividends and share repurchases. As of September 26, 2020, the Company had $5.0 billion of Commercial Paper outstanding, with a weighted-average interest rate of 0.62% and maturities generally less than nine months. The Company may enter into agreements to sell certain of its marketable securities with a promise to repurchase the securities at a specified time and amount as an additional short-term liquidity arrangement. Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 25 As of September 26, 2020, the Company had outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $106.1 billion (collectively the “Notes”). During 2020, the Company issued $16.1 billion and repaid or redeemed $12.6 billion of Notes. The Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on the Notes. In addition, the Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into foreign currency swaps to manage foreign currency risk on the Notes. Further information regarding the Company’s debt issuances and related hedging activity can be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 3, “Financial Instruments” and Note 6, “Debt.” Capital Return Program As of September 26, 2020, the Company was authorized to purchase up to $225 billion of the Company’s common stock under a share repurchase program, of which $168.6 billion had been utilized. During 2020, the Company repurchased 917 million shares of its common stock for $72.5 billion, including 141 million shares delivered under a $10.0 billion November 2019 ASR and 64 million shares delivered under a $6.0 billion May 2020 ASR. The Company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. Under this program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act. As of September 26, 2020, the Company’s quarterly cash dividend was $0.205 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. Contractual Obligations The following table presents certain payments due by the Company as of September 26, 2020, and includes amounts already recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, except for manufacturing purchase obligations, other purchase obligations and certain lease obligations (in millions): Payments due in 2021 Payments due in 2022–2023 Payments due in 2024–2025 Payments due after 2025 Total Term debt $ 8,750 $ 20,958 $ 21,029 $ 55,341 $ 106,078 Leases 1,622 3,097 2,352 5,888 12,959 Manufacturing purchase obligations (1) 47,961 1,849 61 40 49,911 Other purchase obligations 6,178 2,736 400 90 9,404 Deemed repatriation tax payable 1,533 5,923 12,955 9,254 29,665 Total $ 66,044 $ 34,563 $ 36,797 $ 70,613 $ 208,017 (1) Represents amount expected to be paid under manufacturing-related supplier arrangements, which are primarily noncancelable. Leases The Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including retail, corporate, manufacturing and data center space. The Company’s retail store and other facility leases typically have original terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multi-year renewal options. The above contractual obligations table includes future payments under leases that had commenced as of September 26, 2020, and were therefore recorded on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet, as well as leases that had been signed but not yet commenced as of September 26, 2020. Further information regarding the Company’s leases can be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 12, “Leases.” Manufacturing Purchase Obligations The Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture sub-assemblies for the Company’s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. These outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Other Purchase Obligations The Company’s other purchase obligations consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and noncancelable obligations related to advertising, licensing, R&D, Internet and telecommunications services, content creation and other activities. Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 26 Deemed Repatriation Tax Payable As of September 26, 2020, a significant portion of the other non-current liabilities in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet consisted of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the Act. The Company plans to pay the deemed repatriation tax payable in installments in accordance with the Act. Other Non-Current Liabilities The Company’s remaining other non-current liabilities primarily consist of items for which the Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing or amount of payments; therefore, such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligations table. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates, and such differences may be material. Management believes the Company’s critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition, valuation of manufacturing-related assets and estimation of inventory purchase commitment cancellation fees, warranty costs, income taxes, and legal and other contingencies. Management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the Company’s financial condition and operating results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters. The Company’s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors. Revenue Recognition The Company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud, Siri and Maps. The third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (“SSPs”). Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company’s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided. The Company’s process for determining estimated SSPs involves management’s judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. Should future facts and circumstances change, the Company’s SSPs and the future rate of related amortization for product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights related to future sales of these devices could change. Factors subject to change include the nature of the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights offered, their estimated value and the estimated period they are expected to be provided. Valuation of Manufacturing-Related Assets and Estimation of Inventory Purchase Commitment Cancellation Fees The Company invests in manufacturing-related assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers’ facilities and prepayments provided to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term agreements to secure the supply of inventory. The Company also accrues estimated purchase commitment cancellation fees related to inventory orders that have been canceled or are expected to be canceled. The Company’s estimates of future product development plans and demand for its products are key inputs in determining the recoverability of manufacturing-related assets and assessing the adequacy of any purchase commitment cancellation fee accruals. If there is an abrupt and substantial decline in estimated demand for one or more of the Company’s products, a change in the Company’s product development plans, or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the Company’s products, the Company may be required to record write-downs or impairments of manufacturing-related assets or accrue purchase commitment cancellation fees. Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 27 Warranty Costs The Company offers limited warranties on its new and certified refurbished hardware products and on parts used to repair its hardware products, and customers may purchase extended service coverage, where available, on many of the Company’s hardware products. The Company accrues the estimated cost of warranties in the period the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost per claim and knowledge of specific product failures outside the Company’s typical experience. If actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liabilities would be required. Income Taxes The Company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater-than-50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of GAAP and complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results. Legal and Other Contingencies As discussed in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading “Legal Proceedings” and in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, “Commitments and Contingencies,” the Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Except as described in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, “Commitments and Contingencies” under the heading “Contingencies,” in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management The Company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps, both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate exposures. Given the effective horizons of the Company’s risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures, there can be no assurance these positions will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates. Further, the recognition of the gains and losses related to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and operating results. Interest Rate Risk The Company’s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company’s investment portfolio and outstanding debt. While the Company is exposed to global interest rate fluctuations, the Company’s interest income and expense are most sensitive to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and the fair value of those securities, as well as costs associated with hedging and interest paid on the Company’s debt. The Company’s investment policy and strategy are focused on the preservation of capital and supporting the Company’s liquidity requirements. The Company uses a combination of internal and external management to execute its investment strategy and achieve its investment objectives. The Company typically invests in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company’s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the Company’s investment portfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $3.1 billion and $2.8 billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio, respectively. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity. Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 28 As of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, the Company had outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of $107.4 billion and $102.1 billion, respectively. The Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its outstanding term debt. Interest rate swaps allow the Company to effectively convert fixed-rate payments into floating-rate payments or floating-rate payments into fixed-rate payments. Gains and losses on term debt are generally offset by the corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instrument. A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the Company’s debt as of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019 to increase by $218 million and $325 million on an annualized basis, respectively. Foreign Currency Risk In general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company’s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is a risk that the Company will have to adjust local currency pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. In addition, the Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on its foreign currency–denominated debt issuances. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. To provide an assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the Company’s foreign currency derivative positions, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk (“VAR”) model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model consisted of using a Monte Carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company’s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $551 million as of September 26, 2020, compared to a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $452 million as of September 28, 2019. Because the Company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, the losses in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures. Actual future gains and losses associated with the Company’s investment portfolio, debt and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of September 26, 2020 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and the Company’s actual exposures and positions.

Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 35 Apple Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation and Preparation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively “Apple” or the “Company”). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. In the opinion of the Company’s management, the consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation. The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. The Company’s fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018 spanned 52 weeks each. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Common Stock Split On August 28, 2020, the Company effected a four -for-one stock split to shareholders of record as of August 24, 2020. All share, restricted stock unit (“RSU”) and per share or per RSU information has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Leases At the beginning of the first quarter of 2020, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (the “FASB”) Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (“ASU 2016-02”), and additional ASUs issued to clarify and update the guidance in ASU 2016-02 (collectively, the “new leases standard”), which modifies lease accounting for lessees to increase transparency and comparability by recording lease assets and liabilities for operating leases and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The Company adopted the new leases standard utilizing the modified retrospective transition method, under which amounts in prior periods presented were not restated. For contracts existing at the time of adoption, the Company elected to not reassess (i) whether any are or contain leases, (ii) lease classification, and (iii) initial direct costs. Upon adoption, the Company recorded $ 7.5 billion of right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and $ 8.1 billion of lease liabilities on its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. Hedging At the beginning of the first quarter of 2020, the Company adopted FASB ASU No. 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities (“ASU 2017-12”). ASU 2017-12 expands component and fair value hedging, specifies the presentation of the effects of hedging instruments, eliminates the separate measurement and presentation of hedge ineffectiveness, and updates disclosure requirements related to hedging. The Company adopted ASU 2017-12 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. Upon adoption, the Company recorded a $ 136 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (“AOCI”) and a corresponding decrease in retained earnings in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Shareholders’ Equity. Advertising Costs Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Share-Based Compensation The Company generally measures share-based compensation based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant, and recognizes expense on a straight-line basis for its estimate of equity awards that will ultimately vest. Further information regarding share-based compensation can be found in Note 9, “Benefit Plans.” Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 36 Earnings Per Share The following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for 2020, 2019 and 2018 (net income in millions and shares in thousands): 2020 2019 2018 Numerator: Net income $ 57,411 $ 55,256 $ 59,531 Denominator: Weighted-average basic shares outstanding 17,352,119 18,471,336 19,821,510 Effect of dilutive securities 176,095 124,315 178,925 Weighted-average diluted shares 17,528,214 18,595,651 20,000,435 Basic earnings per share $ 3.31 $ 2.99 $ 3.00 Diluted earnings per share $ 3.28 $ 2.97 $ 2.98 The Company applies the treasury stock method to determine the dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities. Potentially dilutive securities representing 62 million shares of common stock were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for 2019 because their effect would have been antidilutive. Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents. The Company’s investments in marketable debt securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. The Company classifies its marketable debt securities as either short-term or long-term based on each instrument’s underlying contractual maturity date. Unrealized gains and losses on marketable debt securities classified as available-for-sale are recognized in other comprehensive income/(loss) (“OCI”). The Company’s investments in marketable equity securities are classified based on the nature of the securities and their availability for use in current operations. The Company’s marketable equity securities are measured at fair value with gains and losses recognized in other income/(expense), net (“OI&E”). The cost of securities sold is determined using the specific identification method. Inventories Inventories are measured using the first-in, first-out method. Property, Plant and Equipment Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which for buildings is the lesser of 40 years or the remaining life of the building; between one and five years for machinery and equipment, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment; and the shorter of lease term or useful life for leasehold improvements. Capitalized costs related to internal-use software are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from three to seven years . Depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment was $ 9.7 billion, $ 11.3 billion and $ 9.3 billion during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Non-cash investing activities involving property, plant and equipment resulted in a net increase/(decrease) to accounts payable and other current liabilities of $( 2.9 ) billion and $ 3.4 billion during 2019 and 2018, respectively. Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 37 Non-Marketable Securities The Company has elected to apply the measurement alternative to equity securities without readily determinable fair values. As such, the Company’s non-marketable equity securities are measured at cost, less any impairment, and are adjusted for changes in fair value resulting from observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. Gains and losses on non-marketable equity securities are recognized in OI&E. Restricted Cash and Restricted Marketable Securities The Company considers cash and marketable securities to be restricted when withdrawal or general use is legally restricted. The Company reports restricted cash as other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and determines current or non-current classification based on the expected duration of the restriction. The Company reports restricted marketable securities as current or non-current marketable securities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets based on the classification of the underlying securities. Fair Value Measurements The fair values of the Company’s money market funds and certain marketable equity securities are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. The valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of the Company’s debt instruments and all other financial instruments, which generally have counterparties with high credit ratings, are based on quoted market prices or model-driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data. Note 2 – Revenue Recognition Net sales consist of revenue from the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad, Services and other products. The Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is transferred to its customers. Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company’s Products net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company’s Services net sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable. The Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer incentive programs based on the Company’s expectations and historical experience. For arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the Company allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (“SSPs”). When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are established that reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company’s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation. The Company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud, Siri and Maps. The third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company’s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided. Cost of sales related to delivered hardware and bundled software, including estimated warranty costs, are recognized at the time of sale. Costs incurred to provide product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights are recognized as cost of sales as incurred. For certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For these arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized revenue, and has elected not to disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services. Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 38 For the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products including, but not limited to, evaluating if it can establish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party applications sold through the App Store and certain digital content sold through the Company’s other digital content stores, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for such sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission it retains. The Company has elected to record revenue net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities, with the collected taxes recorded within other current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority. Deferred Revenue As of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, the Company had total deferred revenue of $ 10.2 billion and $ 8.1 billion, respectively. As of September 26, 2020, the Company expects 65 % of total deferred revenue to be realized in less than a year, 25 % within one-to-two years, 8 % within two-to-three years and 2 % in greater than three years. Disaggregated Revenue Net sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows (in millions): 2020 2019 2018 iPhone (1) $ 137,781 $ 142,381 $ 164,888 Mac (1) 28,622 25,740 25,198 iPad (1) 23,724 21,280 18,380 Wearables, Home and Accessories (1)(2) 30,620 24,482 17,381 Services (3) 53,768 46,291 39,748 Total net sales (4) $ 274,515 $ 260,174 $ 265,595 (1) Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are bundled in the sales price of the respective product. (2) Wearables, Home and Accessories net sales include sales of AirPods, Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats products, HomePod, iPod touch and Apple-branded and third-party accessories. (3) Services net sales include sales from the Company’s advertising, AppleCare, digital content and other services. Services net sales also include amortization of the deferred value of Maps, Siri, and free iCloud storage and Apple TV+ services, which are bundled in the sales price of certain products. (4) Includes $ 5.0 billion of revenue recognized in 2020 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 28, 2019, $ 5.9 billion of revenue recognized in 2019 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 29, 2018, and $ 5.8 billion of revenue recognized in 2018 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 30, 2017. The Company’s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable segment in Note 11, “Segment Information and Geographic Data” for 2020, 2019 and 2018.

(3) As of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, total marketable securities included $ 18.6 billion and $ 18.9 billion, respectively, that was restricted from general use, related to the State Aid Decision (refer to Note 5, “Income Taxes”) and other agreements. Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 40 The Company may sell certain of its marketable debt securities prior to their stated maturities for reasons including, but not limited to, managing liquidity, credit risk, duration and asset allocation. The maturities of the Company’s non-current marketable debt securities generally range from one to five years . The Company typically invests in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company’s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. Fair values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. When evaluating a marketable debt security for other-than-temporary impairment, the Company reviews factors such as the duration and extent to which the fair value of the security is less than its cost, the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto, and the Company’s intent to sell, or whether it will more likely than not be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. As of September 26, 2020, the Company does not consider any of its marketable debt securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired. Non-Marketable Securities The Company holds non-marketable equity securities of certain privately held companies without readily determinable fair values. As of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, the Company’s non-marketable equity securities had a carrying value of $ 2.8 billion and $ 2.9 billion, respectively. Restricted Cash A reconciliation of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents in the Consolidated Balance Sheets to cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019 is as follows (in millions): 2020 2019 Cash and cash equivalents $ 38,016 $ 48,844 Restricted cash included in other current assets 36 23 Restricted cash included in other non-current assets 1,737 1,357 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 39,789 $ 50,224 The Company’s restricted cash primarily consisted of cash to support the Company’s iPhone Upgrade Program. Derivative Financial Instruments The Company may use derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risk on expected future cash flows, net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries, and certain existing assets and liabilities. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign currency exchange or interest rates. To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar may hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue, and subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar may hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries’ functional currencies. The Company may enter into forward contracts, option contracts or other instruments to manage this risk and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months. To protect the net investment in a foreign operation from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset a portion of the changes in the carrying amounts of these investments due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, the Company may use non-derivative financial instruments, such as its foreign currency–denominated debt, as hedges of its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries. In both of these cases, the Company designates these instruments as net investment hedges. To protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. These instruments may offset a portion of the foreign currency remeasurement gains or losses, or changes in fair value. The Company may designate these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of September 26, 2020, the Company’s hedged term debt– and marketable securities–related foreign currency transactions are expected to be recognized within 22 years. The Company may also enter into non-designated foreign currency contracts to offset a portion of the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 41 To protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. These instruments may offset a portion of the changes in interest income or expense, or changes in fair value. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of September 26, 2020, the Company’s hedged interest rate transactions are expected to be recognized within seven years . Cash Flow Hedges Cash flow hedge amounts that are included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in AOCI until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of foreign currency revenue are recognized as a component of net sales in the same period as the related revenue is recognized, and deferred gains and losses related to cash flow hedges of inventory purchases are recognized as a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related costs are recognized. Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of interest income or expense are recognized in OI&E in the same period as the related income or expense is recognized. For options designated as cash flow hedges, the time value is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognized in the financial statement line item to which the hedge relates on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OCI. Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially identified time period or within a subsequent two-month time period. Deferred gains and losses in AOCI associated with such derivative instruments are reclassified into OI&E in the period of de-designation. Any subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are reflected in OI&E unless they are re-designated as hedges of other transactions. Net Investment Hedges Net investment hedge amounts that are included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recorded in OCI as a part of the cumulative translation adjustment. For foreign exchange forward contracts designated as net investment hedges, the forward carry component is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognized in OCI on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OCI. Fair Value Hedges Fair value hedge gains and losses related to amounts that are included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in earnings along with a corresponding loss or gain related to the change in value of the hedged item in the same line in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For foreign exchange forward contracts designated as fair value hedges, the forward carry component is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognized in OI&E on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge. Amounts excluded from the effectiveness assessment of fair value hedges and recognized in OI&E were gains of $ 465 million and $ 777 million for 2020 and 2019, respectively. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OCI. Non-Designated Derivatives Derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are adjusted to fair value through earnings in the financial statement line item to which the derivative relates. The Company records all derivatives in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The Company’s accounting treatment for these derivative instruments is based on its hedge designation. The following tables show the Company’s derivative instruments at gross fair value as of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019 (in millions): 2020 Fair Value of Derivatives Designated as Hedge Instruments Fair Value of Derivatives Not Designated as Hedge Instruments Total Fair Value Derivative assets (1) : Foreign exchange contracts $ 749 $ 303 $ 1,052 Interest rate contracts $ 1,557 $ — $ 1,557 Derivative liabilities (2) : Foreign exchange contracts $ 1,561 $ 485 $ 2,046 Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 42 2019 Fair Value of Derivatives Designated as Hedge Instruments Fair Value of Derivatives Not Designated as Hedge Instruments Total Fair Value Derivative assets (1) : Foreign exchange contracts $ 1,798 $ 323 $ 2,121 Interest rate contracts $ 685 $ — $ 685 Derivative liabilities (2) : Foreign exchange contracts $ 1,341 $ 160 $ 1,501 Interest rate contracts $ 105 $ — $ 105 (1) The fair value of derivative assets is measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and is included in other current assets and other non-current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. (2) The fair value of derivative liabilities is measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and is included in other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company classifies cash flows related to derivative financial instruments as operating activities in its Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The following table shows the pre-tax gains and losses of the Company’s derivative and non-derivative instruments designated as cash flow and fair value hedges in OCI and the Consolidated Statements of Operations for 2020, 2019 and 2018 (in millions): 2020 2019 2018 Gains/(Losses) recognized in OCI – included in effectiveness assessment: Cash flow hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ 365 $ ( 959 ) $ 682 Interest rate contracts ( 57 ) — 1 Total $ 308 $ ( 959 ) $ 683 Net investment hedges: Foreign currency debt $ 15 $ ( 58 ) $ 4 Gains/(Losses) reclassified from AOCI into net income – included in effectiveness assessment: Cash flow hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ 1,553 $ ( 116 ) $ ( 482 ) Interest rate contracts ( 8 ) ( 7 ) 1 Total $ 1,545 $ ( 123 ) $ ( 481 ) The amount excluded from the effectiveness assessment of the Company’s hedges and recognized in OCI was a loss of $ 168 million for 2020. Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 43 The following tables show information about the Company’s derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges and the related hedged items for 2020, 2019 and 2018 and as of September 26, 2020 (in millions): 2020 2019 2018 Gains/(Losses) on derivative instruments (1) : Foreign exchange contracts $ ( 992 ) $ 1,020 $ ( 168 ) Interest rate contracts 1,114 2,068 ( 1,363 ) Total $ 122 $ 3,088 $ ( 1,531 ) Gains/(Losses) related to hedged items (1) : Marketable securities $ 991 $ ( 1,018 ) $ 167 Fixed-rate debt ( 1,114 ) ( 2,068 ) 1,363 Total $ ( 123 ) $ ( 3,086 ) $ 1,530 2020 Carrying amounts of hedged assets/(liabilities): Marketable securities (2) $ 16,270 Fixed-rate debt (3) $ ( 21,033 ) Cumulative hedging adjustments included in the carrying amounts of hedged items: Marketable securities carrying amount increases/(decreases) $ 493 Fixed-rate debt carrying amount (increases)/decreases $ ( 1,541 ) (1) Gains and losses related to fair value hedges are included in OI&E in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. (2) The carrying amounts of marketable securities that are designated as hedged items in fair value hedges are included in current marketable securities and non-current marketable securities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. (3) The carrying amounts of fixed-rate debt instruments that are designated as hedged items in fair value hedges are included in current term debt and non-current term debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The following table shows the notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments and credit risk amounts associated with outstanding or unsettled derivative instruments as of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019 (in millions): 2020 2019 Notional Amount Credit Risk Amount Notional Amount Credit Risk Amount Instruments designated as accounting hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ 57,410 $ 749 $ 61,795 $ 1,798 Interest rate contracts $ 20,700 $ 1,557 $ 31,250 $ 685 Instruments not designated as accounting hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ 88,636 $ 303 $ 76,868 $ 323 The notional amounts for outstanding derivative instruments provide one measure of the transaction volume outstanding and do not represent the amount of the Company’s exposure to credit or market loss. The credit risk amounts represent the Company’s gross exposure to potential accounting loss on derivative instruments that are outstanding or unsettled if all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current currency or interest rates at each respective date. The Company’s exposure to credit loss and market risk will vary over time as currency and interest rates change. Although the table above reflects the notional and credit risk amounts of the Company’s derivative instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses associated with the exposures and transactions that the instruments are intended to hedge. The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments. Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 44 The Company generally enters into master netting arrangements, which are designed to reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. The Company presents its derivative assets and derivative liabilities at their gross fair values in its Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, the net cash collateral received by the Company related to derivative instruments under its collateral security arrangements was $ 875 million and $ 1.6 billion, respectively. The Company includes gross collateral posted and received in other current assets and other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, respectively. Under master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to the Company’s derivative contracts, the Company is allowed to net settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, the potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the Company’s derivative contracts, including the effects of collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $ 2.8 billion and $ 2.7 billion, respectively, resulting in net derivative liabilities of $ 312 million and $ 407 million, respectively. Accounts Receivable Trade Receivables The Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, resellers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral or third-party credit support in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements. As of both September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, the Company had no customers that individually represented 10% or more of total trade receivables. The Company’s cellular network carriers accounted for 51 % of total trade receivables as of September 28, 2019. Vendor Non-Trade Receivables The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. As of September 26, 2020, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 57 % and 11 %. As of September 28, 2019, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 59 % and 14 %. Note 4 – Consolidated Financial Statement Details The following tables show the Company’s consolidated financial statement details as of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019 (in millions): Property, Plant and Equipment, Net 2020 2019 Land and buildings $ 17,952 $ 17,085 Machinery, equipment and internal-use software 75,291 69,797 Leasehold improvements 10,283 9,075 Gross property, plant and equipment 103,526 95,957 Accumulated depreciation and amortization ( 66,760 ) ( 58,579 ) Total property, plant and equipment, net $ 36,766 $ 37,378 Other Non-Current Liabilities 2020 2019 Long-term taxes payable $ 28,170 $ 29,545 Other non-current liabilities 26,320 20,958 Total other non-current liabilities $ 54,490 $ 50,503 Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 45 Other Income/(Expense), Net The following table shows the detail of OI&E for 2020, 2019 and 2018 (in millions): 2020 2019 2018 Interest and dividend income $ 3,763 $ 4,961 $ 5,686 Interest expense ( 2,873 ) ( 3,576 ) ( 3,240 ) Other income/(expense), net ( 87 ) 422 ( 441 ) Total other income/(expense), net $ 803 $ 1,807 $ 2,005 Note 5 – Income Taxes U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”), which significantly changed U.S. tax law. The Act lowered the Company’s U.S. statutory federal income tax rate from 35 % to 21 % effective January 1, 2018, while also imposing a deemed repatriation tax on previously deferred foreign income. The Act also created a new minimum tax on certain foreign earnings, for which the Company has elected to record certain deferred tax assets and liabilities. Provision for Income Taxes and Effective Tax Rate The provision for income taxes for 2020, 2019 and 2018, consisted of the following (in millions): 2020 2019 2018 Federal: Current $ 6,306 $ 6,384 $ 41,425 Deferred ( 3,619 ) ( 2,939 ) ( 33,819 ) Total 2,687 3,445 7,606 State: Current 455 475 551 Deferred 21 ( 67 ) 48 Total 476 408 599 Foreign: Current 3,134 3,962 3,986 Deferred 3,383 2,666 1,181 Total 6,517 6,628 5,167 Provision for income taxes $ 9,680 $ 10,481 $ 13,372 The foreign provision for income taxes is based on foreign pre-tax earnings of $ 38.1 billion, $ 44.3 billion and $ 48.0 billion in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. A reconciliation of the provision for income taxes, with the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate ( 21 % in 2020 and 2019; 24.5 % in 2018) to income before provision for income taxes for 2020, 2019 and 2018, is as follows (dollars in millions): 2020 2019 2018 Computed expected tax $ 14,089 $ 13,805 $ 17,890 State taxes, net of federal effect 423 423 271 Impacts of the Act ( 582 ) — 1,515 Earnings of foreign subsidiaries ( 2,534 ) ( 2,625 ) ( 5,606 ) Research and development credit, net ( 728 ) ( 548 ) ( 560 ) Excess tax benefits from equity awards ( 930 ) ( 639 ) ( 675 ) Other ( 58 ) 65 537 Provision for income taxes $ 9,680 $ 10,481 $ 13,372 Effective tax rate 14.4 % 15.9 % 18.3 % Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 46 Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities As of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, the significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities were (in millions): 2020 2019 Deferred tax assets: Amortization and depreciation $ 8,317 $ 11,645 Accrued liabilities and other reserves 4,934 5,196 Lease liabilities 2,038 — Deferred revenue 1,638 1,372 Other 2,409 2,174 Total deferred tax assets 19,336 20,387 Less: Valuation allowance ( 1,041 ) ( 747 ) Total deferred tax assets, net 18,295 19,640 Deferred tax liabilities: Minimum tax on foreign earnings 7,045 10,809 Right-of-use assets 1,862 — Unrealized gains 526 186 Other 705 600 Total deferred tax liabilities 10,138 11,595 Net deferred tax assets $ 8,157 $ 8,045 Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the effects of tax credits and the future income tax effects of temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and are measured using enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Uncertain Tax Positions As of September 26, 2020, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $ 16.5 billion, of which $ 8.8 billion, if recognized, would impact the Company’s effective tax rate. As of September 28, 2019, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $ 15.6 billion, of which $ 8.6 billion, if recognized, would have impacted the Company’s effective tax rate. The aggregate change in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which excludes interest and penalties, for 2020, 2019 and 2018, is as follows (in millions): 2020 2019 2018 Beginning balances $ 15,619 $ 9,694 $ 8,407 Increases related to tax positions taken during a prior year 454 5,845 2,431 Decreases related to tax positions taken during a prior year ( 791 ) ( 686 ) ( 2,212 ) Increases related to tax positions taken during the current year 1,347 1,697 1,824 Decreases related to settlements with taxing authorities ( 85 ) ( 852 ) ( 756 ) Decreases related to expiration of the statute of limitations ( 69 ) ( 79 ) — Ending balances $ 16,475 $ 15,619 $ 9,694 The Company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and many state and foreign jurisdictions. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) concluded its review of the years 2013 through 2015 in 2018, and all years before 2016 are closed. Tax years after 2014 remain open in certain major foreign jurisdictions and are subject to examination by the taxing authorities. The Company believes that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Company’s tax audits are resolved in a manner inconsistent with its expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs. Although the timing of resolution and/or closure of audits is not certain, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that its gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease in the next 12 months by as much as $ 3.9 billion. Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 47 Interest and Penalties The Company includes interest and penalties related to income tax matters within the provision for income taxes. As of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, the total amount of gross interest and penalties accrued was $ 1.4 billion and $ 1.3 billion, respectively. The Company recognized interest and penalty expense in 2020, 2019 and 2018 of $ 85 million, $ 73 million and $ 489 million, respectively. European Commission State Aid Decision On August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company (the “State Aid Decision”). The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The recovery amount was calculated to be € 13.1 billion, plus interest of € 1.2 billion. The Company and Ireland appealed the State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the “General Court”). On July 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September 25, 2020, the European Commission appealed the General Court’s decision to the European Court of Justice. The Company believes that any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision would be creditable against U.S. taxes, subject to any foreign tax credit limitations in the Act. On an annual basis, the Company may request approval from the Irish Minister for Finance to reduce the recovery amount for certain taxes paid to other countries. As of September 26, 2020, the adjusted recovery amount was € 12.9 billion, excluding interest. The adjusted recovery amount plus interest is funded into escrow, where it will remain restricted from general use pending the conclusion of all legal proceedings. Refer to the Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities section of Note 3, “Financial Instruments” for more information. Note 6 – Debt Commercial Paper and Repurchase Agreements The Company issues unsecured short-term promissory notes (“Commercial Paper”) pursuant to a commercial paper program.

As of September 28, 2019, a portion of the Company’s Japanese yen–denominated notes with a carrying value of $ 1.0 billion was designated as a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of the Company’s net investment in a foreign operation. The Company’s Japanese yen–denominated notes matured during 2020 and the associated net investment hedges were terminated. For further discussion regarding the Company’s use of derivative instruments, refer to the Derivative Financial Instruments section of Note 3, “Financial Instruments.” The effective interest rates for the Notes include the interest on the Notes, amortization of the discount or premium and, if applicable, adjustments related to hedging.

Note 9 – Benefit Plans 2014 Employee Stock Plan In the second quarter of 2014, shareholders approved the 2014 Employee Stock Plan (the “2014 Plan”) and terminated the Company’s authority to grant new awards under the 2003 Employee Stock Plan (the “2003 Plan”). The 2014 Plan provides for broad-based equity grants to employees, including executive officers, and permits the granting of RSUs, stock grants, performance-based awards, stock options and stock appreciation rights, as well as cash bonus awards. RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan generally vest over four years , based on continued employment, and are settled upon vesting in shares of the Company’s common stock on a one -for-one basis. RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan reduce the number of shares available for grant under the plan by a factor of two times the number of RSUs granted. RSUs canceled and shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations increase the number of shares available for grant under the 2014 Plan utilizing a factor of two times the number of RSUs canceled or shares withheld. Currently, all RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan have dividend equivalent rights (“DERs”), which entitle holders of RSUs to the same dividend value per share as holders of common stock. DERs are subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the corresponding unvested RSUs. DERs are accumulated and paid when the underlying shares vest. Upon approval of the 2014 Plan, the Company reserved 1.54 billion shares plus the number of shares remaining that were reserved but not issued under the 2003 Plan. Shares subject to outstanding awards under the 2003 Plan that expire, are canceled or otherwise terminate, or are withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations for RSUs, will also be available for awards under the 2014 Plan. As of September 26, 2020, approximately 808 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the 2014 Plan. Apple Inc. Non-Employee Director Stock Plan The Apple Inc. Non-Employee Director Stock Plan (the “Director Plan”) is a shareholder-approved plan that (i) permits the Company to grant awards of RSUs or stock options to the Company’s non-employee directors, (ii) provides for automatic initial grants of RSUs upon a non-employee director joining the Board of Directors and automatic annual grants of RSUs at each annual meeting of shareholders, and (iii) permits the Board of Directors to prospectively change the value and relative mixture of stock options and RSUs for the initial and annual award grants and the methodology for determining the number of shares of the Company’s common stock subject to these grants, in each case within the limits set forth in the Director Plan and without further shareholder approval. RSUs granted under the Director Plan reduce the number of shares available for grant under the plan by a factor of two times the number of RSUs granted. The Director Plan expires on November 12, 2027. All RSUs granted under the Director Plan are entitled to DERs. DERs are subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the corresponding unvested RSUs. DERs are accumulated and paid when the underlying shares vest. As of September 26, 2020, approximately 4 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the Director Plan. Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 51 Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans During the three months ended September 26, 2020, Section 16 officers Katherine L. Adams, Timothy D. Cook, Chris Kondo, Luca Maestri, Deirdre O’Brien and Jeffrey Williams had equity trading plans in place in accordance with Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) under the Exchange Act. An equity trading plan is a written document that pre-establishes the amounts, prices and dates (or formula for determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of the Company’s stock, including shares acquired under the Company’s employee and director equity plans. Employee Stock Purchase Plan The Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “Purchase Plan”) is a shareholder-approved plan under which substantially all employees may purchase the Company’s common stock through payroll deductions at a price equal to 85 % of the lower of the fair market values of the stock as of the beginning or the end of six-month offering periods. An employee’s payroll deductions under the Purchase Plan are limited to 10 % of the employee’s compensation and employees may not purchase more than $ 25,000 of stock during any calendar year. As of September 26, 2020, approximately 107 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the Purchase Plan. 401(k) Plan The Company’s 401(k) Plan is a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the 401(k) Plan, participating U.S. employees may defer a portion of their pre-tax earnings, up to the IRS annual contribution limit ($ 19,500 for calendar year 2020). The Company matches 50 % to 100 % of each employee’s contributions, depending on length of service, up to a maximum of 6 % of the employee’s eligible earnings. Restricted Stock Units A summary of the Company’s RSU activity and related information for 2020, 2019 and 2018, is as follows: Number of RSUs (in thousands) Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value Per RSU Aggregate Fair Value (in millions) Balance as of September 30, 2017 390,284 $ 27.58 RSUs granted 181,402 $ 40.72 RSUs vested ( 178,873 ) $ 27.81 RSUs canceled ( 24,195 ) $ 31.95 Balance as of September 29, 2018 368,618 $ 33.65 RSUs granted 147,409 $ 53.99 RSUs vested ( 168,350 ) $ 33.80 RSUs canceled ( 21,609 ) $ 40.71 Balance as of September 28, 2019 326,068 $ 42.30 RSUs granted 156,800 $ 59.20 RSUs vested ( 157,743 ) $ 40.29 RSUs canceled ( 14,347 ) $ 48.07 Balance as of September 26, 2020 310,778 $ 51.58 $ 34,894 The fair value as of the respective vesting dates of RSUs was $ 10.8 billion, $ 8.6 billion and $ 7.6 billion for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The majority of RSUs that vested in 2020, 2019 and 2018 were net share settled such that the Company withheld shares with a value equivalent to the employees’ obligation for the applicable income and other employment taxes, and remitted the cash to the appropriate taxing authorities. The total shares withheld were approximately 56 million, 59 million and 64 million for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and were based on the value of the RSUs on their respective vesting dates as determined by the Company’s closing stock price. Total payments for the employees’ tax obligations to taxing authorities were $ 3.9 billion, $ 3.0 billion and $ 2.7 billion in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 52 Share-Based Compensation The following table shows share-based compensation expense and the related income tax benefit included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for 2020, 2019 and 2018 (in millions): 2020 2019 2018 Share-based compensation expense $ 6,829 $ 6,068 $ 5,340 Income tax benefit related to share-based compensation expense $ ( 2,476 ) $ ( 1,967 ) $ ( 1,893 ) As of September 26, 2020, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding RSUs and stock options was $ 12.2 billion, which the Company expects to recognize over a weighted-average period of 2.6 years. Note 10 – Commitments and Contingencies Accrued Warranty and Guarantees The following table shows changes in the Company’s accrued warranties and related costs for 2020, 2019 and 2018 (in millions): 2020 2019 2018 Beginning accrued warranty and related costs $ 3,570 $ 3,692 $ 3,834 Cost of warranty claims ( 2,956 ) ( 3,857 ) ( 4,115 ) Accruals for product warranty 2,740 3,735 3,973 Ending accrued warranty and related costs $ 3,354 $ 3,570 $ 3,692 The Company offers an iPhone Upgrade Program, which is available to customers who purchase a qualifying iPhone in the U.S., the U.K. and China mainland. The iPhone Upgrade Program provides customers the right to trade in that iPhone for a specified amount when purchasing a new iPhone, provided certain conditions are met. The Company accounts for the trade-in right as a guarantee liability and recognizes arrangement revenue net of the fair value of such right, with subsequent changes to the guarantee liability recognized within net sales. Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product Although most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets and other electronic devices. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements. The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Substantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia, with some Mac computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland. Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 53 Unconditional Purchase Obligations The Company has entered into certain off–balance sheet commitments that require the future purchase of goods or services (“unconditional purchase obligations”). The Company’s unconditional purchase obligations primarily consist of payments for supplier arrangements, Internet and telecommunication services, intellectual property licenses and content creation. Future payments under noncancelable unconditional purchase obligations having a remaining term in excess of one year as of September 26, 2020, are as follows (in millions): 2021 $ 3,476 2022 2,885 2023 1,700 2024 357 2025 104 Thereafter 130 Total $ 8,652 Contingencies The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully resolved. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims, except for the following matters: VirnetX VirnetX, Inc. (“VirnetX”) filed a lawsuit against the Company alleging that certain of the Company’s products infringe on patents owned by VirnetX. On April 11, 2018, a jury returned a verdict against the Company and awarded damages of $ 503 million. The Company appealed the verdict to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which remanded the case back to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, where it is scheduled for a re-trial in October 2020. The Company has challenged the validity of the patents at issue in the re-trial at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the “PTO”), and the PTO has declared the patents invalid, subject to further appeal by VirnetX. iOS Performance Management Cases Various civil litigation matters have been filed in state and federal courts in the U.S. and in various international jurisdictions alleging violation of consumer protection laws, fraud, computer intrusion and other causes of action related to the Company’s performance management feature used in its iPhone operating systems, introduced to certain iPhones in iOS updates 10.2.1 and 11.2. The claims seek monetary damages and other non-monetary relief. On April 5, 2018, several U.S. federal actions were consolidated through a Multidistrict Litigation process into a single action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the “Northern California District Court”). On February 28, 2020, the parties in the Multidistrict Litigation reached a settlement to resolve the U.S. federal and California state class actions. Under the terms of the settlement, which the Northern California District Court preliminarily approved in May 2020, the Company has agreed to pay up to $ 500 million in the aggregate to certain U.S. owners of iPhones if certain conditions are met. The final amount of the settlement will be determined based on the number of consumers who file valid claims and the attorneys’ fee award. However, the Company has agreed to pay at least $ 310 million to settle the claims. In addition to civil litigation, the Company is also responding to governmental investigations and requests for information relating to the performance management feature. The Company continues to believe that its iPhones were not defective, that the performance management feature introduced with iOS updates 10.2.1 and 11.2 was intended to, and did, improve customers’ user experience, and that the Company did not make any misleading statements or fail to disclose any material information. The Company has accrued its best estimate for the ultimate resolution of these matters. French Competition Authority On March 16, 2020, the French Competition Authority (“FCA”) announced its decision that aspects of the Company’s sales and distribution practices in France violate French competition law, and issued a fine of € 1.1 billion. The Company strongly disagrees with the FCA’s decision, and has appealed. Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 54 Optis Optis Wireless Technology, LLC and related entities (“Optis”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas against the Company alleging that certain of the Company’s products infringe on patents owned by Optis. On August 11, 2020, a jury returned a verdict against the Company and awarded damages of $ 506 million. The Company has asked the court to set aside the verdict, where the case remains pending. Note 11 – Segment Information and Geographic Data The Company reports segment information based on the “management” approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company’s reportable segments. The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described in Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.” The Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company’s retail stores located in those geographic locations. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the reportable segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as research and development, corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges and other separately managed general and administrative costs. The Company does not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes. The following table shows information by reportable segment for 2020, 2019 and 2018 (in millions): 2020 2019 2018 Americas: Net sales $ 124,556 $ 116,914 $ 112,093 Operating income $ 37,722 $ 35,099 $ 34,864 Europe: Net sales $ 68,640 $ 60,288 $ 62,420 Operating income $ 22,170 $ 19,195 $ 19,955 Greater China: Net sales $ 40,308 $ 43,678 $ 51,942 Operating income $ 15,261 $ 16,232 $ 19,742 Japan: Net sales $ 21,418 $ 21,506 $ 21,733 Operating income $ 9,279 $ 9,369 $ 9,500 Rest of Asia Pacific: Net sales $ 19,593 $ 17,788 $ 17,407 Operating income $ 6,808 $ 6,055 $ 6,181 Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 55 A reconciliation of the Company’s segment operating income to the Consolidated Statements of Operations for 2020, 2019 and 2018 is as follows (in millions): 2020 2019 2018 Segment operating income $ 91,240 $ 85,950 $ 90,242 Research and development expense ( 18,752 ) ( 16,217 ) ( 14,236 ) Other corporate expenses, net ( 6,200 ) ( 5,803 ) ( 5,108 ) Total operating income $ 66,288 $ 63,930 $ 70,898 The U.S. and China were the only countries that accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s net sales in 2020, 2019 and 2018. There was no single customer that accounted for more than 10% of net sales in 2020, 2019 and 2018. Net sales for 2020, 2019 and 2018 and long-lived assets as of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019 were as follows (in millions): 2020 2019 2018 Net sales: U.S. $ 109,197 $ 102,266 $ 98,061 China (1) 40,308 43,678 51,942 Other countries 125,010 114,230 115,592 Total net sales $ 274,515 $ 260,174 $ 265,595 2020 2019 Long-lived assets: U.S. $ 25,890 $ 24,711 China (1) 7,256 9,064 Other countries 3,620 3,603 Total long-lived assets $ 36,766 $ 37,378 (1) China includes Hong Kong and Taiwan. Long-lived assets located in China consist primarily of product tooling and manufacturing process equipment and assets related to retail stores and related infrastructure. Note 12 – Leases The Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including retail, corporate, manufacturing and data center space. These leases typically have original terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multi-year renewal options, some of which are reasonably certain of exercise. The Company’s lease arrangements may contain both lease and non-lease components. The Company has elected to combine and account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for leases of retail, corporate, and data center facilities. Payments under the Company’s lease arrangements may be fixed or variable, and variable lease payments are primarily based on purchases of output of the underlying leased assets. Lease costs associated with fixed payments on the Company’s operating leases were $ 1.5 billion for 2020. Lease costs associated with variable payments on the Company’s leases were $ 9.3 billion for 2020. Rent expense for operating leases, as previously reported under former lease accounting standards, was $ 1.3 billion and $ 1.2 billion in 2019 and 2018, respectively. For 2020, the Company made $ 1.5 billion of fixed cash payments related to operating leases. Non-cash activities involving ROU assets obtained in exchange for lease liabilities were $ 10.5 billion for 2020, including the impact of adopting the new leases standard in the first quarter of 2020.

The discount rates are generally based on estimates of the Company’s incremental borrowing rate, as the discount rates implicit in the Company’s leases cannot be readily determined. As of September 26, 2020, the Company had $ 1.7 billion of future payments under additional leases, primarily for corporate facilities and retail space, that had not yet commenced. These leases will commence between 2021 and 2022, with lease terms ranging from 1 year to 20 years.

Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 58 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Apple Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Apple Inc. as of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 26, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Apple Inc. at September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 26, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the “PCAOB”), Apple Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 26, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated October 29, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of Apple Inc.’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Apple Inc.’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Apple Inc. in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates. Uncertain Tax Positions Description of the Matter As discussed in Note 5 to the financial statements, Apple Inc. is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and many state and foreign jurisdictions. As of September 26, 2020, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $16.5 billion, of which $8.8 billion, if recognized, would impact Apple Inc.’s effective tax rate. Apple Inc. uses significant judgment in the calculation of tax liabilities in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of technical merits and complex tax laws. Auditing management’s evaluation of whether an uncertain tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and the measurement of the benefit of various tax positions can be complex, involves significant judgment, and is based on interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings. Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 59 How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We tested controls relating to the evaluation of uncertain tax positions, including controls over management’s assessment as to whether tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained, management’s process to measure the benefit of its tax positions, and the development of the related disclosures. To evaluate Apple Inc.’s assessment of which tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained, our audit procedures included, among others, reading and evaluating management’s assumptions and analysis, and, as applicable, Apple Inc.’s communications with taxing authorities, that detailed the basis and technical merits of the uncertain tax positions. We involved our tax subject matter resources in assessing the technical merits of certain of Apple Inc.’s tax positions based on our knowledge of relevant tax laws and experience with related taxing authorities. For certain tax positions, we also received external legal counsel confirmation letters and discussed the matters with external advisors and Apple Inc. tax personnel. In addition, we evaluated Apple Inc.’s disclosure in relation to these matters included in Note 5 to the financial statements. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP We have served as Apple Inc.’s auditor since 2009. San Jose, California October 29, 2020 Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 60 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Apple Inc. Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have audited Apple Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 26, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the “COSO criteria”). In our opinion, Apple Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 26, 2020, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the “PCAOB”), the consolidated balance sheets of Apple Inc. as of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 26, 2020, and the related notes and our report dated October 29, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion Apple Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Apple Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Apple Inc. in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP San Jose, California October 29, 2020 Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 61 Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure None. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act were effective as of September 26, 2020 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Inherent Limitations over Internal Controls The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company’s assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that the Company’s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company’s management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company’s internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on the Company’s assessment, management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 26, 2020 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, which appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2020, which were identified in connection with management’s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law. PART I Item 1. Business Company Background The Company designs, manufactures and markets smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories, and sells a variety of related services. The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. The Company is a California corporation established in 1977. Products iPhone iPhone ® is the Company’s line of smartphones based on its iOS operating system. In September 2019, the Company introduced three new iPhones: iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max. Mac Mac ® is the Company’s line of personal computers based on its macOS ® operating system. During 2019, the Company released a new version of MacBook Air ® and a new Mac mini ® , and introduced an updated Mac Pro ® , which is expected to be available in the fall of 2019. iPad iPad ® is the Company’s line of multi-purpose tablets. iPad is based on the Company’s iPadOS™ operating system, which was introduced during 2019. Also during 2019, the Company released two new versions of iPad Pro ® , an iPad Air ® , an updated iPad mini ® and a new 10.2-inch iPad. Wearables, Home and Accessories Wearables, Home and Accessories includes AirPods ® , Apple TV ® , Apple Watch ® , Beats ® products, HomePod™, iPod touch ® and other Apple-branded and third-party accessories. AirPods are the Company’s wireless headphones that interact with Siri. In October 2019, the Company introduced AirPods Pro™. Apple Watch is a personal electronic device that combines the watchOS ® user interface and other technologies created specifically for a smaller device. In September 2019, the Company introduced Apple Watch Series 5. Services Digital Content Stores and Streaming Services The Company operates various platforms that allow customers to discover and download applications and digital content, such as books, music, video, games and podcasts. These platforms include the App Store ® , available for iPhone and iPad, the Mac App Store, the TV App Store and the Watch App Store. The Company also offers subscription-based digital content streaming services, including Apple Music ® , which offers users a curated listening experience with on-demand radio stations, and Apple TV+, which offers exclusive original content, and is expected to be available in November 2019. Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 1 AppleCare AppleCare ® includes AppleCare + (“AC+”) and the AppleCare Protection Plan, which are fee-based services that extend the coverage of phone support eligibility and hardware repairs. AC+ offers additional coverage for instances of accidental damage and is available in certain countries for certain products. Additionally, AC+ with theft and loss protection is available for iPhone in the U.S. iCloud iCloud ® is the Company’s cloud service, which stores music, photos, contacts, calendars, mail, documents and more, keeping them up-to-date and available across multiple Apple devices and Windows personal computers. Licensing The Company licenses the use of certain of its intellectual property, and provides other related services. Other Services The Company delivers a variety of other services available in certain countries, including Apple Arcade™, a game subscription service; Apple Card™, a co-branded credit card; Apple News+, a subscription news and magazine service; and Apple Pay, a cashless payment service. Markets and Distribution The Company’s customers are primarily in the consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise and government markets. The Company sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. The Company also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels, such as third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. During 2019 , the Company’s net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 31% and 69%, respectively, of total net sales. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales in 2019 , 2018 and 2017 . Competition The markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive and the Company is confronted by aggressive competition in all areas of its business. These markets are characterized by frequent product introductions and rapid technological advances that have substantially increased the capabilities and use of smartphones, personal computers, tablets and other electronic devices. Many of the Company’s competitors that sell mobile devices and personal computers based on other operating systems seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures. Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service features (including security features), relative price and performance, product and service quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and accessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, and corporate reputation. The Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets and other electronic devices. These markets are highly competitive and include many large, well-funded and experienced participants. The Company expects competition in these markets to intensify significantly as competitors imitate features of the Company’s products and applications within their products, or collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. These markets are characterized by aggressive price competition, frequent product introductions, evolving design approaches and technologies, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. The Company’s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company believes it offers superior innovation and integration of the entire solution, including hardware, software and services. Some of the Company’s current and potential competitors have substantial resources and may be able to provide such products and services at little or no profit, or even at a loss, to compete with the Company’s offerings. Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 2 Supply of Components Although most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets and other electronic devices. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements. The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Substantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia, with some Mac computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland. Research and Development Because the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through research and development (“R&D”), licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology. Intellectual Property The Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices, accessories, software and services. This includes patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade dress and other forms of intellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although the Company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel. The Company regularly files patent applications to protect innovations arising from its research, development and design, and is currently pursuing thousands of patent applications around the world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued patents, including utility patents, design patents and others. The Company also holds copyrights relating to certain aspects of its products and services. No single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company’s products. The Company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products. In addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the Company’s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of the Company’s products, processes and services. While the Company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all. Business Seasonality and Product Introductions The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction. Employees As of September 28, 2019 , the Company had approximately 137,000 full-time equivalent employees. Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 3 Available Information The Company’s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to reports filed pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).

Risk Factors The following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. These risk factors may be important to understanding other statements in this Form 10-K. The following information should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K. The business, financial condition and operating results of the Company can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described below, any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly, cause the Company’s actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from past, or from anticipated future, financial condition and operating results. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, operating results and stock price. Because of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company’s financial condition and operating results, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. Global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and growth . The Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’s total net sales. In addition, a majority of the Company’s supply chain, and its manufacturing and assembly activities, are located outside the U.S. As a result, the Company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions. Adverse macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, slower growth or recession, new or increased tariffs, changes to fiscal and monetary policy, tighter credit, higher interest rates, high unemployment and currency fluctuations could materially adversely affect demand for the Company’s products and services. In addition, consumer confidence and spending could be adversely affected in response to financial market volatility, negative financial news, conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets, declines in income or asset values, changes to fuel and other energy costs, labor and healthcare costs and other economic factors. In addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company’s products, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic conditions could have a significant impact on the Company’s suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners. Potential effects include financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance operations and purchases of the Company’s products; and insolvency. A downturn in the economic environment could also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company’s trade receivables; the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the Company’s ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair value of the Company’s financial instruments. These and other economic factors could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and growth. Global markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets. The Company’s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price/performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. The Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in R&D. There can be no assurance that these investments will achieve expected returns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully. The Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to register, numerous patents, trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and emulating the Company’s products and infringing on its intellectual property. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the Company’s intellectual property, the Company’s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be adversely affected. Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 5 The Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors may have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. Additionally, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company’s product features and applications within their products or collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the Company’s approach to providing components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions. Some of the markets in which the Company competes have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted. In addition, an increasing number of Internet-enabled devices that include software applications and are smaller, simpler and cheaper than traditional personal computers compete with some of the Company’s existing products. The Company’s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company’s financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the Company’s ability to continually improve its products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively. To remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services. Due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services, and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services. The success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors including, but not limited to, timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company’s ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for new products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies. Accordingly, the Company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product and service introductions and transitions. The Company depends on the performance of carriers, wholesalers, retailers and other resellers. The Company distributes its products through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers, many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers. The Company also sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. Some carriers providing cellular network service for iPhone offer financing, installment payment plans or subsidies for users’ purchases of the device. There is no assurance that such offers will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the Company’s agreements with these carriers or in agreements the Company enters into with new carriers. The Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers’ stores with Company employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays. These programs can require a substantial investment while not assuring return or incremental sales. The financial condition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Company’s products, or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the Company’s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company’s products. Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 6 The Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk. The Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers’ facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable, no assurance can be given that the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes. The Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. Manufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company’s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for periods up to 150 days . Because the Company’s markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments. Future operating results depend upon the Company’s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms. Because the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that could materially adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and operating results. While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms. The effects of global or regional economic conditions on the Company’s suppliers, described in “ Global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and growth ,” above, also could affect the Company’s ability to obtain components . Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results. The Company’s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements. If the Company’s supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company’s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. The Company’s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. The Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of which are located outside of the U.S. Substantially all of the Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia. A significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements can lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company’s direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished control may have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products or services, or the Company’s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect liability. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, material violations of the supplier code of conduct could occur. The Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many components, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company’s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can have a negative impact on the Company’s cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, military actions, economic, business, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, or international trade disputes. Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 7 The Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be reduced or terminated and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted. The Company’s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the Company’s business and result in harm to the Company’s reputation. The Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the Company, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products. Defects can also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects could make the Company’s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the Company’s products are introduced into specialized applications, including healthcare. In addition, the Company’s service offerings may have quality issues and from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, the Company’s services may not perform as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software and services it offers. Failure to do so could result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the Company’s products and services. In addition, the Company can be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property, plant and equipment, and/or intangible assets, and significant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems can also adversely affect the experience for users of the Company’s products and services, and result in harm to the Company’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales. The Company relies on access to third-party digital content, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell currently available content. The licensing or other distribution arrangements with these third parties are for relatively short terms and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and can take actions to make it more difficult or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content in the future. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company’s access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules, or continue to expand its geographic reach. Failure to obtain the right to make third-party digital content available, or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results. Some third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. If requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There is no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner. In addition, certain countries have passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force the Company to license its digital rights management, which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could negatively affect arrangements with the Company’s content providers. The Company’s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers. The Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications and services. There is no assurance that third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the Company’s products. If third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company’s products, customers may choose not to buy the Company’s products. The Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers’ perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the Company’s products compared to competitors’ platforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets and Windows for personal computers. This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of product sales, and the costs of developing such applications and services. Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 8 The Company’s minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets could make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company’s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors’ products with larger market share. If developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company’s devices may suffer. The Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products. The Company’s products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and if third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, third-party applications might not take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences or might not operate correctly and may result in dissatisfied customers. The Company sells and delivers third-party applications for its products through the App Store, Mac App Store, TV App Store and Watch App Store. The Company retains a commission from sales through these platforms. If developers reduce their use of these platforms to distribute their applications and offer in-app purchases to customers, then the volume of sales, and the commission that the Company earns on those sales, would decrease. The Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Many of the Company’s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties, which requires licenses from those third parties. In addition, because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company currently competes or in the future may compete, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, the Company’s products and services may unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Based on experience and industry practice, the Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. There is, however, no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, could preclude the Company from selling certain products or services, or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results. The Company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings, such as being found to have infringed on intellectual property rights . The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved, and new claims may arise in the future. In addition, agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which can subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. Claims against the Company based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights have generally increased over time and may continue to increase. In particular, the Company has historically faced a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled products, and new claims may arise in the future. For example, technology and other patent-holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in several U.S. jurisdictions, as well as internationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages. Regardless of the merit of particular claims, litigation can be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the Company’s operations and distracting to management. In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into licensing agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such disputes. No assurance can be given that such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These agreements may also significantly increase the Company’s cost of sales and operating expenses. Except as described in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, “Commitments and Contingencies” under the heading “Contingencies,” in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims, including matters related to infringement of intellectual property rights. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome could result in significant compensatory, punitive or trebled monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results. While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise. Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 9 The Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects on the Company’s business. The Company’s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects including, but not limited to: antitrust; privacy, data security and data localization; consumer protection; advertising, sales, billing and e-commerce; product liability; intellectual property ownership and infringement; digital platforms; Internet, telecommunications, and mobile communications; media, television, film and digital content; availability of third-party software applications and services; labor and employment; anti-corruption; import, export and trade; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; anti–money laundering; foreign ownership and investment; tax; and environmental, health and safety. Compliance with these laws and regulations may be onerous and expensive, increasing the cost of conducting the Company’s global operations. Changes to laws and regulations can adversely affect the Company’s business by increasing the Company’s costs, limiting the Company’s ability to offer a product or service to customers, requiring changes to the Company’s business practices or otherwise making the Company’s products and services less attractive to customers. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that the Company’s employees, contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company’s policies and procedures. If the Company is found to have violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect the Company’s reputation, financial condition and operating results. The technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and regulatory scrutiny, which exposes the Company to government investigations, legal actions and penalties. For example, the Company is subject to antitrust investigations in various jurisdictions around the world, which can result in legal proceedings and claims against the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results. There can be no assurance that the Company’s business will not be materially adversely affected, individually or in the aggregate, by the outcomes of such investigations or changes to laws and regulations in the future. The Company’s retail stores have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. The Company’s retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory and personnel. The Company also has entered into substantial lease commitments for retail space. Certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than the Company’s more typical retail stores. Due to the high cost structure associated with the Company’s retail stores, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of an individual store or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance costs. The Company’s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the Company’s financial condition and operating results, including macro-economic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity. Other factors include, but are not limited to, the Company’s ability to: manage costs associated with retail store construction and operation; manage relationships with existing retail partners; manage costs associated with fluctuations in the value of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost. Investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company’s ongoing business and present risks not originally contemplated. The Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater-than-expected liabilities and expenses, inadequate return on capital, and unidentified issues not discovered in the Company’s due diligence. These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful. The Company’s business and reputation may be impacted by information technology system failures or network disruptions. The Company is exposed to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, or other events or disruptions. System redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company’s business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions can adversely impact the Company’s business by, among other things, preventing access to the Company’s online services, interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the Company’s products. These events could materially adversely affect the Company’s reputation, financial condition and operating results. Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 10 There may be losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personally identifiable information, that could subject the Company to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences. The Company’s business requires it to use and store confidential information including, among other things, personally identifiable information (“PII”) with respect to the Company’s customers and employees. The Company devotes significant resources to network and data security, including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data. But these measures cannot provide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the Company’s reputation, financial condition and operating results. The Company’s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties. Although the Company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to third parties, such measures are not always effective and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the Company’s reputation, financial condition and operating results. For example, the Company may experience a security breach impacting the Company’s information technology systems that compromises the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential information. Such an incident could, among other things, impair the Company’s ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services, impact the Company’s stock price, materially damage supplier relationships, and expose the Company to litigation or government investigations, which could result in penalties, fines or judgments against the Company. Although malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information, including PII, affect many companies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and processes. The Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data, including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies. As with all companies, these security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty password management or other irregularities. For example, third parties fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names, passwords or other sensitive information, which may, in turn, be used to access the Company’s information technology systems. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, may result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the Company’s products and services. In addition to the risks relating to general confidential information described above, the Company is also subject to specific obligations relating to health data and payment card data. Health data is subject to additional privacy, security and breach notification requirements, and the Company can be subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the Company’s compliance with these obligations. If the Company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements, or if health data is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the Company’s agreements with healthcare institutions, the Company could be subject to litigation or government investigations, may be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and could also incur significant fees or fines. Under payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder information is potentially compromised, the Company could be liable for associated investigatory expenses and could also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards. The Company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards, which would materially adversely affect the Company’s reputation, financial condition and operating results. While the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise. The Company’s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding data protection. The Company is subject to federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of PII. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also may restrict transfers of PII among the Company and its international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the Company to incur substantial costs or require the Company to change its business practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability. The Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of PII through its privacy policy, information provided on its website and press statements. Any failure by the Company to comply with these public statements or with other federal, state or international privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. In addition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability. Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 11 The Company’s success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key personnel. Much of the Company’s future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly skilled employees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley, where most of the Company’s key personnel are located. The Company’s business can be impacted by political events, international trade disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions. Political events, international trade disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions could harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners. International trade disputes can result in tariffs and other measures that can adversely affect the Company’s business. For example, trade tensions have led to a series of tariffs imposed by the U.S. on imports from China. Tariffs increase the cost of the Company’s products and the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs adversely impact the gross margin that the Company earns on its products. Tariffs can also make the Company’s products more expensive for customers, which could make the Company’s products less competitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also adopt other measures that could limit the Company’s ability to offer its products and services. Political uncertainty surrounding international trade disputes and measures could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company’s business. Many of the Company’s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company’s suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, labor disputes, public health issues and other events beyond the Company’s control. Global climate change could result in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Such events could make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company’s supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company’s service offerings. Following an interruption to its business, the Company could require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company. The Company’s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While the Company’s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in disruption to the Company’s business and harm to the Company’s reputation. Should major public health issues, including pandemics, arise, the Company could be adversely affected by more stringent employee travel restrictions, additional limitations in freight services, governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions, delays in production ramps of new products, and disruptions in the operations of the Company’s suppliers and contract manufacturers. While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise. The Company expects its quarterly net sales and operating results to fluctuate. The Company’s profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For example, gross margins on the Company’s hardware products vary across product lines and can change over time. The Company’s gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in response to such pressures; increased competition; the Company’s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and acquiring and delivering content for the Company’s services; the Company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; and the introduction of new products or services, including new products or services with higher cost structures. These and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results. Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 12 The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company’s products or services, issues with new product or service introductions, information technology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company’s logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners. The Company’s stock price is subject to volatility. The Company’s stock price has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, the Company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies’ operating performance. Price volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its stock to exceed the stock’s price at a given point in time. The Company believes its stock price should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability. The Company also believes its stock price should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow, and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Company’s Board of Directors, and the Company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, its stock price may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention. The Company’s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies. The Company’s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non–U.S. dollar–denominated sales, cost of sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company’s products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company’s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar’s strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency–denominated sales. Conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Company’s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins. The Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place. The Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio. The Company’s investments can be negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and economic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results. Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 13 The Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen. The Company distributes its products through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. The Company also sells its products directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the Company’s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance. The Company’s exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September 28, 2019 , a significant portion of the Company’s trade receivables was concentrated within cellular network carriers, and its vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses. The Company could be subject to changes in its tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. The Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland, where a number of the Company’s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. The Company’s effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including in the U.S. and Ireland. The Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company’s effective tax rates were to increase, particularly in the U.S. or Ireland, or if the ultimate determination of the Company’s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company’s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. Item 2. Properties The Company’s headquarters are located in Cupertino, California. As of September 28, 2019 , the Company owned or leased facilities and land for corporate functions, R&D, data centers, retail and other purposes at locations throughout the U.S. and in various places outside the U.S. The Company believes its existing facilities and equipment, which are used by all reportable segments, are in good operating condition and are suitable for the conduct of its business. Item 3. Legal Proceedings The Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. Except as described in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, “Commitments and Contingencies” under the heading “Contingencies,” in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Refer to the risk factor “ The Company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings, such as being found to have infringed on intellectual property rights ” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.” The Company settled certain matters during the fourth quarter of 2019 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating results. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures Not applicable. Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 14 PART II Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities The Company’s common stock is traded on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC under the symbol AAPL.

The remaining $78.9 billion in the table represents the amount available to repurchase shares under the authorized repurchase program as of September 28, 2019 . The Company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. Under this program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act. (2) In February 2019, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase arrangement (“ASR”) to purchase up to $12.0 billion of the Company’s common stock. In August 2019, the purchase period for this ASR ended and an additional 6.9 million shares were delivered and retired. In total, 62.0 million shares were delivered under this ASR at an average repurchase price of $193.69 .

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This section and other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Form 10-K”) contain forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. Forward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as “future,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “predicts,” “will,” “would,” “could,” “can,” “may,” and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company’s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors,” which are incorporated herein by reference. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Unless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Company’s fiscal calendar, and references to particular years, quarters, months or periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Each of the terms the “Company” and “Apple” as used herein refers collectively to Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, unless otherwise stated. The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law. This section of this Form 10-K generally discusses 2019 and 2018 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018 . Discussions of 2017 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2018 and 2017 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2018 . Fiscal Period The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. The Company’s fiscal years 2019 and 2018 spanned 52 weeks each, whereas fiscal year 2017 included 53 weeks. A 14th week was included in the first quarter of 2017, as is done every five or six years, to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. Fiscal 2019 Highlights Total net sales decreased 2% or $5.4 billion during 2019 compared to 2018, driven by lower net sales of iPhone, partially offset by higher net sales of Wearables, Home and Accessories and Services in all geographic operating segments. The weakness in foreign currencies had a significant unfavorable impact on net sales during 2019. In April 2019, the Company announced an increase to its current share repurchase program authorization from $100 billion to $175 billion and raised its quarterly dividend from $0.73 to $0.77 per share beginning in May 2019. During 2019, the Company repurchased $67.1 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $14.1 billion . Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 18 Products and Services Performance Beginning in the first quarter of 2019, the Company classified the amortization of the deferred value of Maps, Siri and free iCloud services, which are bundled in the sales price of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products, in Services net sales. Historically, the Company classified the amortization of these amounts in Products net sales consistent with its management reporting framework. As a result, Products and Services net sales for 2018 and 2017 were reclassified to conform to the 2019 presentation. The following table shows net sales by category for 2019 , 2018 and 2017 (dollars in millions): 2019 Change 2018 Change 2017 Net sales by category: iPhone (1) $ 142,381 (14 )% $ 164,888 18 % $ 139,337 Mac (1) 25,740 2 % 25,198 (1 )% 25,569 iPad (1) 21,280 16 % 18,380 (2 )% 18,802 Wearables, Home and Accessories (1)(2) 24,482 41 % 17,381 36 % 12,826 Services (3) 46,291 16 % 39,748 22 % 32,700 Total net sales $ 260,174 (2 )% $ 265,595 16 % $ 229,234 (1) Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are bundled in the sales price of the respective product. (2) Wearables, Home and Accessories net sales include sales of AirPods, Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats products, HomePod, iPod touch and Apple-branded and third-party accessories. (3) Services net sales include sales from the Company’s digital content stores and streaming services, AppleCare, licensing and other services. Services net sales also include amortization of the deferred value of Maps, Siri and free iCloud services, which are bundled in the sales price of certain products. iPhone iPhone net sales decreased during 2019 compared to 2018 due primarily to lower iPhone unit sales. Mac Mac net sales increased during 2019 compared to 2018 due primarily to higher net sales of MacBook Air, partially offset by lower net sales of MacBook ® and MacBook Pro ® . iPad iPad net sales increased during 2019 compared to 2018 due primarily to higher net sales of iPad Pro. Wearables, Home and Accessories Wearables, Home and Accessories net sales increased during 2019 compared to 2018 due primarily to higher net sales of AirPods and Apple Watch. Services Services net sales increased during 2019 compared to 2018 due primarily to higher net sales from the App Store, licensing and AppleCare. Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 19 Segment Operating Performance The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. Further information regarding the Company’s reportable segments can be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 11, “Segment Information and Geographic Data.” The following table shows net sales by reportable segment for 2019 , 2018 and 2017 (dollars in millions): 2019 Change 2018 Change 2017 Net sales by reportable segment: Americas $ 116,914 4 % $ 112,093 16 % $ 96,600 Europe 60,288 (3 )% 62,420 14 % 54,938 Greater China 43,678 (16 )% 51,942 16 % 44,764 Japan 21,506 (1 )% 21,733 23 % 17,733 Rest of Asia Pacific 17,788 2 % 17,407 15 % 15,199 Total net sales $ 260,174 (2 )% $ 265,595 16 % $ 229,234 Americas Americas net sales increased during 2019 compared to 2018 due primarily to higher Services and Wearables, Home and Accessories net sales, partially offset by lower iPhone net sales. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable impact on Americas net sales during 2019. Europe Europe net sales decreased during 2019 compared to 2018 due to lower iPhone net sales, partially offset by higher Wearables, Home and Accessories and Services net sales. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had a significant unfavorable impact on Europe net sales during 2019. Greater China Greater China net sales decreased during 2019 compared to 2018 due primarily to lower iPhone net sales, partially offset by higher Wearables, Home and Accessories and Services net sales. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable impact on Greater China net sales during 2019. Japan Japan net sales decreased during 2019 compared to 2018 due to lower iPhone net sales, partially offset by higher Services and Wearables, Home and Accessories net sales. The value of the Japanese Yen relative to the U.S. dollar had a favorable impact on Japan net sales during 2019. Rest of Asia Pacific Rest of Asia Pacific net sales increased during 2019 compared to 2018 due primarily to higher Wearables, Home and Accessories and Services net sales, partially offset by lower iPhone net sales. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had a significant unfavorable impact on Rest of Asia Pacific net sales during 2019. Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 20 Gross Margin Products and Services gross margin and gross margin percentage for 2019 , 2018 and 2017 were as follows (dollars in millions): 2019 2018 2017 Gross margin: Products $ 68,887 $ 77,683 $ 70,197 Services 29,505 24,156 17,989 Total gross margin $ 98,392 $ 101,839 $ 88,186 Gross margin percentage: Products 32.2 % 34.4 % 35.7 % Services 63.7 % 60.8 % 55.0 % Total gross margin percentage 37.8 % 38.3 % 38.5 % Products Gross Margin Products gross margin and Products gross margin percentage decreased during 2019 compared to 2018 due primarily to lower iPhone unit sales and the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Products gross margin increased during 2018 compared to 2017 due primarily to a favorable shift in mix of iPhones and the strength in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, partially offset by higher product cost structures. Year-over-year Products gross margin percentage decreased during 2018 due primarily to higher product cost structures, partially offset by the strength in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Services Gross Margin Year-over-year Services gross margin increased during 2019 and 2018 due primarily to higher Services net sales and a different services mix. Year-over-year Services gross margin percentage increased during 2019 and 2018 due primarily to a different services mix and leverage of the Company’s services fixed cost structure from higher Services net sales. The Company’s future gross margins can be impacted by a variety of factors, as set forth in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors”. As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and remain under downward pressure. Operating Expenses Operating expenses for 2019 , 2018 and 2017 were as follows (dollars in millions): 2019 Change 2018 Change 2017 Research and development $ 16,217 14 % $ 14,236 23 % $ 11,581 Percentage of total net sales 6 % 5 % 5 % Selling, general and administrative $ 18,245 9 % $ 16,705 9 % $ 15,261 Percentage of total net sales 7 % 6 % 7 % Total operating expenses $ 34,462 11 % $ 30,941 15 % $ 26,842 Percentage of total net sales 13 % 12 % 12 % Research and Development The year-over-year growth in R&D expense in 2019 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses. The Company continues to believe that focused investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace, and to the development of new and updated products and services that are central to the Company’s core business strategy. Selling, General and Administrative The year-over-year growth in selling, general and administrative expense in 2019 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses and higher spending on marketing and advertising and infrastructure-related costs. Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 21 Other Income/(Expense), Net Other income/(expense), net (“OI&E”) for 2019 , 2018 and 2017 was as follows (dollars in millions): 2019 Change 2018 Change 2017 Interest and dividend income $ 4,961 $ 5,686 $ 5,201 Interest expense (3,576 ) (3,240 ) (2,323 ) Other income/(expense), net 422 (441 ) (133 ) Total other income/(expense), net $ 1,807 (10 )% $ 2,005 (27 )% $ 2,745 The year-over-year decrease in OI&E during 2019 was due primarily to lower interest income and higher interest expense, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange–related items. The weighted-average interest rate earned by the Company on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was 2.19% and 2.16% in 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for 2019 , 2018 and 2017 were as follows (dollars in millions): 2019 2018 2017 Provision for income taxes $ 10,481 $ 13,372 $ 15,738 Effective tax rate 15.9 % 18.3 % 24.6 % Statutory federal income tax rate 21.0 % 24.5 % 35.0 % On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”), which significantly changed U.S. tax law. The Act lowered the Company’s U.S. statutory federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, while also imposing a deemed repatriation tax on previously deferred foreign income. By operation of law, the Company applied a blended U.S. statutory federal income tax rate of 24.5% for 2018 (the “2018 blended U.S. tax rate”). The Act also created a new minimum tax on certain foreign earnings. The Company’s effective tax rate for 2019 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to the lower tax rate on foreign earnings and tax benefits from share-based compensation. The Company’s effective tax rate for 2018 was lower than the 2018 blended U.S. tax rate due primarily to the lower tax rate on foreign earnings, partially offset by the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the Act. The Company’s effective tax rate for 2019 was lower compared to 2018 due primarily to a lower statutory federal income tax rate in 2019 and the impact of the Act in 2018, partially offset by higher taxes on foreign earnings in 2019. As of September 28, 2019 , the Company had net deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences and tax credits of $14.3 billion and deferred tax liabilities of $6.2 billion . Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to recover the net deferred tax assets. The Company will continue to evaluate the amount of the valuation allowance, if any, by assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Hedging In August 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities (“ASU 2017-12”). ASU 2017-12 expands component and fair value hedging, specifies the presentation of the effects of hedging instruments, and eliminates the separate measurement and presentation of hedge ineffectiveness. The Company will adopt ASU 2017-12 in its first quarter of 2020 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. Based on the Company’s derivative portfolio and hedging strategies, the adoption of ASU 2017-12 is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. Financial Instruments In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“ASU 2016-13”), which modifies the measurement of expected credit losses on certain financial instruments. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-13 in its first quarter of 2021 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. Based on the composition of the Company’s investment portfolio, current market conditions, and historical credit loss activity, the adoption of ASU 2016-13 is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 22 Leases In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (“ASU 2016-02”), which modifies lease accounting for lessees to increase transparency and comparability by recording lease assets and liabilities for operating leases and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-02 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method through a cumulative-effect adjustment at the beginning of its first quarter of 2020. Upon adoption, the Company anticipates recording lease-related assets and liabilities of approximately $8 billion on its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet, with no material impact to its Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table presents selected financial information and statistics as of and for the years ended September 28, 2019 , September 29, 2018 and September 30, 2017 (in millions): 2019 2018 2017 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities (1) $ 205,898 $ 237,100 $ 268,895 Property, plant and equipment, net $ 37,378 $ 41,304 $ 33,783 Commercial paper $ 5,980 $ 11,964 $ 11,977 Total term debt $ 102,067 $ 102,519 $ 103,703 Working capital $ 57,101 $ 15,410 $ 28,792 Cash generated by operating activities $ 69,391 $ 77,434 $ 64,225 Cash generated by/(used in) investing activities $ 45,896 $ 16,066 $ (46,446 ) Cash used in financing activities $ (90,976 ) $ (87,876 ) $ (17,974 ) (1) As of September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018 , total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities included $18.9 billion and $20.3 billion , respectively, that was restricted from general use, related to the State Aid Decision (refer to Note 5, “Income Taxes” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) and other agreements. The Company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, along with commercial paper and other short-term liquidity arrangements, will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital asset purchases, dividends, share repurchases, debt repayments and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months. In connection with the State Aid Decision, as of September 28, 2019 , the entire adjusted recovery amount of €12.9 billion plus interest of €1.2 billion was funded into escrow, where it will remain restricted from general use pending the conclusion of all appeals. Further information regarding the State Aid Decision can be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 5, “Income Taxes.” The Company’s marketable securities investment portfolio is primarily invested in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company’s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. During 2019 , cash generated by operating activities of $69.4 billion was a result of $55.3 billion of net income and non-cash adjustments to net income of $17.6 billion , partially offset by a decrease in the net change in operating assets and liabilities of $3.5 billion . Cash generated by investing activities of $45.9 billion during 2019 consisted primarily of proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities, net of purchases, of $57.5 billion , partially offset by cash used to acquire property, plant and equipment of $10.5 billion . Cash used in financing activities of $91.0 billion during 2019 consisted primarily of cash used to repurchase common stock of $66.9 billion , cash used to pay dividends and dividend equivalents of $14.1 billion , cash used to repay term debt of $8.8 billion and net repayments of commercial paper of $6.0 billion , partially offset by net proceeds from the issuance of term debt of $7.0 billion . During 2018 , cash generated by operating activities of $77.4 billion was a result of $59.5 billion of net income and an increase in the net change in operating assets and liabilities of $34.7 billion , partially offset by non-cash adjustments to net income of $16.8 billion . Cash generated by investing activities of $16.1 billion during 2018 consisted primarily of proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities, net of purchases, of $32.4 billion , partially offset by cash used to acquire property, plant and equipment of $13.3 billion . Cash used in financing activities of $87.9 billion during 2018 consisted primarily of cash used to repurchase common stock of $72.7 billion , cash used to pay dividends and dividend equivalents of $13.7 billion and cash used to repay term debt of $6.5 billion , partially offset by net proceeds from the issuance of term debt of $7.0 billion . Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 23 Capital Assets The Company’s capital expenditures were $7.6 billion during 2019 , which included product tooling and manufacturing process equipment; data centers; corporate facilities and infrastructure, including information systems hardware, software and enhancements; and retail store facilities. Debt The Company issues unsecured short-term promissory notes (“Commercial Paper”) pursuant to a commercial paper program. The Company uses the net proceeds from the commercial paper program for general corporate purposes, including dividends and share repurchases. As of September 28, 2019 , the Company had $6.0 billion of Commercial Paper outstanding, with a weighted-average interest rate of 2.24% and maturities generally less than nine months . As of September 28, 2019 , the Company had outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $101.7 billion (collectively the “Notes”). During 2019 , the Company issued $7.0 billion and repaid $8.8 billion of Notes. The Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on the Notes. In addition, the Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into foreign currency swaps to manage foreign currency risk on the Notes. Further information regarding the Company’s debt issuances and related hedging activity can be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 3, “Financial Instruments” and Note 6, “Debt.” Capital Return Program On April 30, 2019, the Company announced the Board of Directors increased the current share repurchase program authorization from $100 billion to $175 billion of the Company’s common stock, of which $96.1 billion had been utilized as of September 28, 2019 . During 2019 , the Company repurchased 345.2 million shares of its common stock for $67.1 billion , including 62.0 million shares delivered under a $12.0 billion ASR dated February 2019, which settled in August 2019. The Company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. Under this program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act. On April 30, 2019, the Company also announced the Board of Directors raised the Company’s quarterly cash dividend from $0.73 to $0.77 per share, beginning with the dividend paid during the third quarter of 2019. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. Contractual Obligations The following table presents certain payments due by the Company as of September 28, 2019 , and excludes amounts already recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, except for term debt and the deemed repatriation tax payable (in millions): Payments due in 2020 Payments due in 2021–2022 Payments due in 2023–2024 Payments due after 2024 Total Term debt $ 10,270 $ 18,278 $ 19,329 $ 53,802 $ 101,679 Operating leases 1,306 2,413 1,746 5,373 10,838 Manufacturing purchase obligations (1) 40,076 1,974 808 69 42,927 Other purchase obligations 3,744 2,271 572 41 6,628 Deemed repatriation tax payable — 4,350 8,501 16,655 29,506 Total $ 55,396 $ 29,286 $ 30,956 $ 75,940 $ 191,578 (1) Represents amount expected to be paid under manufacturing-related supplier arrangements, which are primarily noncancelable. Operating Leases The Company’s retail store and other facility leases typically have original terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multi-year renewal options. Manufacturing Purchase Obligations The Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture sub-assemblies for the Company’s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. These outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days . The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 24 Other Purchase Obligations The Company’s other purchase obligations consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and noncancelable obligations related to advertising, licensing, R&D, Internet and telecommunications services, content creation and other activities. Deemed Repatriation Tax Payable As of September 28, 2019 , a significant portion of the other non-current liabilities in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet consisted of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the Act. The Company plans to pay the deemed repatriation tax payable in installments in accordance with the Act. Other Non-Current Liabilities The Company’s remaining other non-current liabilities primarily consist of items for which the Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing or amount of payments; therefore, such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates, and such differences may be material. Management believes the Company’s critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition, valuation of manufacturing-related assets and estimation of inventory purchase commitment cancellation fees, warranty costs, income taxes, and legal and other contingencies. Management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the Company’s financial condition and operating results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters. The Company’s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors. Revenue Recognition The Company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud, Siri and Maps. The third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (“SSPs”). Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company’s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided. The Company’s process for determining estimated SSPs involves management’s judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. Should future facts and circumstances change, the Company’s SSPs and the future rate of related amortization for product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights related to future sales of these devices could change. Factors subject to change include the nature of the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights offered, their estimated value and the estimated period they are expected to be provided. Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 25 Valuation of Manufacturing-Related Assets and Estimation of Inventory Purchase Commitment Cancellation Fees The Company invests in manufacturing-related assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers’ facilities and prepayments provided to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term agreements to secure the supply of inventory. The Company also accrues estimated purchase commitment cancellation fees related to inventory orders that have been canceled or are expected to be canceled. The Company’s estimates of future product development plans and demand for its products are the key inputs in the determination of the recoverability of manufacturing-related assets and the assessment of the adequacy of any purchase commitment cancellation fee accruals. If there is an abrupt and substantial decline in estimated demand for one or more of the Company’s products, a change in the Company’s product development plans, or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the Company’s products, the Company may be required to record write-downs or impairments of manufacturing-related assets or accrue purchase commitment cancellation fees. Warranty Costs The Company offers limited warranties on its new hardware products and on parts used to repair its hardware products, and customers may purchase extended service coverage, where available, on many of the Company’s hardware products. The Company accrues the estimated cost of warranties in the period the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost per claim and knowledge of specific product failures outside the Company’s typical experience. The Company regularly reviews these estimates and adjusts the amounts as necessary. If actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liabilities would be required. Income Taxes The Company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater-than-50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of GAAP and complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results. Legal and Other Contingencies As discussed in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading “Legal Proceedings” and in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, “Commitments and Contingencies,” the Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Except as described in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, “Commitments and Contingencies” under the heading “Contingencies,” in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management The Company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps, both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate exposures. Given the effective horizons of the Company’s risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures, there can be no assurance these positions will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates. Further, the recognition of the gains and losses related to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and operating results. Interest Rate Risk The Company’s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company’s investment portfolio and outstanding debt. While the Company is exposed to global interest rate fluctuations, the Company’s interest income and expense are most sensitive to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and the fair value of those securities, as well as costs associated with hedging and interest paid on the Company’s debt. Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 26 The Company’s investment policy and strategy are focused on the preservation of capital and supporting the Company’s liquidity requirements. The Company uses a combination of internal and external management to execute its investment strategy and achieve its investment objectives. The Company typically invests in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company’s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the Company’s investment portfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018 , a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $2.8 billion and $4.9 billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio, respectively. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity. As of September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018 , the Company had outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of $102.1 billion and $102.5 billion , respectively. The Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its outstanding term debt. Interest rate swaps allow the Company to effectively convert fixed-rate payments into floating-rate payments or floating-rate payments into fixed-rate payments. Gains and losses on term debt are generally offset by the corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instrument. A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the Company’s debt as of September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018 to increase by $325 million and $399 million on an annualized basis, respectively. Foreign Currency Risk In general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company’s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is a risk that the Company will have to adjust local currency pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. In addition, the Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on its foreign currency–denominated debt issuances. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. To provide an assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the Company’s foreign currency derivative positions, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk (“VAR”) model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model consisted of using a Monte Carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company’s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $452 million as of September 28, 2019 , compared to a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $592 million as of September 29, 2018 . Because the Company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, the losses in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures. Actual future gains and losses associated with the Company’s investment portfolio, debt and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of September 28, 2019 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and the Company’s actual exposures and positions.

Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 33 Apple Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation and Preparation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively “Apple” or the “Company”). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. In the opinion of the Company’s management, the consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation. The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. The Company’s fiscal years 2019 and 2018 spanned 52 weeks each, whereas fiscal year 2017 included 53 weeks. A 14th week was included in the first fiscal quarter of 2017, as is done every five or six years, to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Revenue Recognition In the first quarter of 2019, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (the “FASB”) Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (“ASU 2014-09”), and additional ASUs issued to clarify the guidance in ASU 2014-09 (collectively the “new revenue standard”), which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. The Company adopted the new revenue standard utilizing the full retrospective transition method. The Company did not restate total net sales in the prior periods presented, as the adoption of the new revenue standard did not have a material impact on previously reported amounts. Additionally, beginning in the first quarter of 2019, the Company classified the amortization of the deferred value of Maps, Siri and free iCloud services, which are bundled in the sales price of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products, in Services net sales. Historically, the Company classified the amortization of these amounts in Products net sales consistent with its management reporting framework. As a result, Products and Services net sales for 2018 and 2017 were reclassified to conform to the 2019 presentation. Financial Instruments In the first quarter of 2019, the Company adopted FASB ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments – Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (“ASU 2016-01”), which updates certain aspects of the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. The adoption of ASU 2016-01 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Income Taxes In the first quarter of 2019, the Company adopted FASB ASU No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory (“ASU 2016-16”), which requires the recognition of the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs. The Company adopted ASU 2016-16 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. Upon adoption, the Company recorded $ 2.7 billion of net deferred tax assets, reduced other non-current assets by $ 128 million , and increased retained earnings by $ 2.6 billion on its Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company will recognize incremental deferred income tax expense as these net deferred tax assets are utilized. Restricted Cash In the first quarter of 2019, the Company adopted FASB ASU No. 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash (“ASU 2016-18”), which enhances and clarifies the guidance on the classification and presentation of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows and requires additional disclosures about restricted cash balances. Advertising Costs Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 34 Share-Based Compensation The Company generally measures share-based compensation based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant, and recognizes expense on a straight-line basis for its estimate of equity awards that will ultimately vest. Further information regarding share-based compensation can be found in Note 9, “Benefit Plans.” Earnings Per Share The following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for 2019 , 2018 and 2017 (net income in millions and shares in thousands): 2019 2018 2017 Numerator: Net income $ 55,256 $ 59,531 $ 48,351 Denominator: Weighted-average basic shares outstanding 4,617,834 4,955,377 5,217,242 Effect of dilutive securities 31,079 44,732 34,450 Weighted-average diluted shares 4,648,913 5,000,109 5,251,692 Basic earnings per share $ 11.97 $ 12.01 $ 9.27 Diluted earnings per share $ 11.89 $ 11.91 $ 9.21 The Company applies the treasury stock method to determine the dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities. Potentially dilutive securities representing 15.5 million shares of common stock were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for 2019 because their effect would have been antidilutive. Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents. The Company’s investments in marketable debt securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. The Company classifies its marketable debt securities as either short-term or long-term based on each instrument’s underlying contractual maturity date. Unrealized gains and losses on marketable debt securities classified as available-for-sale are recognized in other comprehensive income/(loss) (“OCI”). The Company’s investments in marketable equity securities are classified based on the nature of the securities and their availability for use in current operations. The Company’s marketable equity securities are measured at fair value with gains and losses recognized in other income/(expense), net (“OI&E”). The cost of securities sold is determined using the specific identification method. Inventories Inventories are measured using the first-in, first-out method. Property, Plant and Equipment Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which for buildings is the lesser of 30 years or the remaining life of the underlying building; between one and five years for machinery and equipment, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment; and the shorter of lease term or useful life for leasehold improvements. Capitalized costs related to internal-use software are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from three to five years . Depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment was $ 11.3 billion , $ 9.3 billion and $ 8.2 billion during 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Non-cash investing activities involving property, plant and equipment resulted in a net increase/(decrease) to accounts payable and other current liabilities of $( 2.9 ) billion and $ 3.4 billion during 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 35 Non-Marketable Securities The Company has elected to apply the measurement alternative to equity securities without readily determinable fair values. As such, the Company’s non-marketable equity securities are measured at cost, less any impairment, and are adjusted for changes in fair value resulting from observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. Gains and losses on non-marketable equity securities are recognized in OI&E. Restricted Cash and Restricted Marketable Securities The Company considers cash and marketable securities to be restricted when withdrawal or general use is legally restricted. The Company records restricted cash as other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and determines current or non-current classification based on the expected duration of the restriction. The Company records restricted marketable securities as current or non-current marketable securities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets based on the classification of the underlying securities . Fair Value Measurements The fair values of the Company’s money market funds and certain marketable equity securities are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. The valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of the Company’s debt instruments and all other financial instruments, which generally have counterparties with high credit ratings, are based on quoted market prices or model-driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data. Note 2 – Revenue Recognition Net sales consist of revenue from the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad, Services and other products. The Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is transferred to its customers. Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company’s Products net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company’s Services net sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable. The Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer incentive programs based on the Company’s expectations and historical experience. For arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are capable of being distinct, the Company allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (“SSPs”). When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are established that reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company’s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation. The Company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud, Siri and Maps. The third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company’s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided. Cost of sales related to delivered hardware and bundled software, including estimated warranty costs, are recognized at the time of sale. Costs incurred to provide product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights are recognized as cost of sales as incurred. For certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For these arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized revenue, and has elected not to disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services. Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 36 For the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products including, but not limited to, evaluating if it can establish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party applications sold through the App Store, Mac App Store, TV App Store and Watch App Store and certain digital content sold through the Company’s other digital content stores, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for such sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission it retains. The Company has elected to record revenue net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities, with the collected taxes recorded within other current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority. Deferred Revenue As of September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018 , the Company had total deferred revenue of $ 8.1 billion and $ 8.8 billion , respectively. As of September 28, 2019 , the Company expects 68 % of total deferred revenue to be realized in less than a year, 25 % within one-to-two years, 6 % within two-to-three years and 1 % in greater than three years. Disaggregated Revenue Net sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2019 , 2018 and 2017 were as follows (in millions): 2019 2018 2017 iPhone (1) $ 142,381 $ 164,888 $ 139,337 Mac (1) 25,740 25,198 25,569 iPad (1) 21,280 18,380 18,802 Wearables, Home and Accessories (1)(2) 24,482 17,381 12,826 Services (3) 46,291 39,748 32,700 Total net sales (4) $ 260,174 $ 265,595 $ 229,234 (1) Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are bundled in the sales price of the respective product. (2) Wearables, Home and Accessories net sales include sales of AirPods, Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats products, HomePod, iPod touch and Apple-branded and third-party accessories. (3) Services net sales include sales from the Company’s digital content stores and streaming services, AppleCare, licensing and other services. Services net sales also include amortization of the deferred value of Maps, Siri and free iCloud services, which are bundled in the sales price of certain products. (4) Includes $ 5.9 billion of revenue recognized in 2019 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 29, 2018 , $ 5.8 billion of revenue recognized in 2018 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 30, 2017 , and $ 6.3 billion of revenue recognized in 2017 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 24, 2016 . The Company’s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable segment in Note 11, “Segment Information and Geographic Data” for 2019 , 2018 and 2017 .

(3) As of September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018 , total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities included $ 18.9 billion and $ 20.3 billion , respectively, that was restricted from general use, related to the State Aid Decision (refer to Note 5, “Income Taxes”) and other agreements. Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 38 The Company may sell certain of its marketable debt securities prior to their stated maturities for reasons including, but not limited to, managing liquidity, credit risk, duration and asset allocation. The maturities of the Company’s long-term marketable debt securities generally range from one to five years . The following tables show information about the Company’s marketable securities that had been in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than 12 months and for 12 months or greater as of September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018 (in millions): 2019 Continuous Unrealized Losses Less than 12 Months 12 Months or Greater Total Fair value of marketable debt securities $ 28,151 $ 28,167 $ 56,318 Unrealized losses $ ( 138 ) $ ( 143 ) $ ( 281 ) 2018 Continuous Unrealized Losses Less than 12 Months 12 Months or Greater Total Fair value of marketable securities $ 126,238 $ 60,599 $ 186,837 Unrealized losses $ ( 2,400 ) $ ( 1,889 ) $ ( 4,289 ) The Company typically invests in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company’s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. Fair values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. When evaluating a marketable debt security for other-than-temporary impairment, the Company reviews factors such as the duration and extent to which the fair value of the security is less than its cost, the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto, and the Company’s intent to sell, or whether it will more likely than not be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. As of September 28, 2019 , the Company does not consider any of its marketable debt securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired. Non-Marketable Securities The Company holds non-marketable equity securities of certain privately held companies without readily determinable fair values. As of September 28, 2019 , the Company’s non-marketable equity securities had a carrying value of $ 2.9 billion . Restricted Cash A reconciliation of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents in the Consolidated Balance Sheet to cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows as of September 28, 2019 is as follows (in millions): 2019 Cash and cash equivalents $ 48,844 Restricted cash included in other current assets 23 Restricted cash included in other non-current assets 1,357 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 50,224 The Company’s restricted cash primarily consisted of cash required to be on deposit under a contractual agreement with a bank to support the Company’s iPhone Upgrade Program. Derivative Financial Instruments The Company may use derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risk on expected future cash flows, net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries, and certain existing assets and liabilities. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign currency exchange or interest rates. To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar may hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue, and subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar may hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries’ functional currencies. The Company may enter into forward contracts, option contracts or other instruments to manage this risk and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months . Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 39 To protect the net investment in a foreign operation from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset a portion of the changes in the carrying amounts of these investments due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, the Company may use non-derivative financial instruments, such as its foreign currency–denominated debt, as hedges of its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries. In both of these cases, the Company designates these instruments as net investment hedges. To protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. These instruments may offset a portion of the foreign currency remeasurement gains or losses, or changes in fair value. The Company may designate these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of September 28, 2019 , the Company’s hedged term debt– and marketable securities–related foreign currency transactions are expected to be recognized within 23 years . The Company may also enter into non-designated foreign currency contracts to offset a portion of the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. To protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. These instruments may offset a portion of the changes in interest income or expense, or changes in fair value. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of September 28, 2019 , the Company’s hedged interest rate transactions are expected to be recognized within 8 years . Cash Flow Hedges The effective portions of cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (“AOCI”) until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of foreign currency revenue are recognized as a component of net sales in the same period as the related revenue is recognized, and deferred gains and losses related to cash flow hedges of inventory purchases are recognized as a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related costs are recognized. Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of interest income or expense are recognized in OI&E in the same period as the related income or expense is recognized. For options designated as cash flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. The ineffective portions and amounts excluded from the effectiveness testing of cash flow hedges are recognized in OI&E. Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially identified time period or within a subsequent two-month time period. Deferred gains and losses in AOCI associated with such derivative instruments are reclassified into OI&E in the period of de-designation. Any subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are reflected in OI&E unless they are re-designated as hedges of other transactions. Net Investment Hedges The effective portions of net investment hedges are recorded in OCI as a part of the cumulative translation adjustment. The ineffective portions and amounts excluded from the effectiveness testing of net investment hedges are recognized in OI&E. For foreign exchange forward contracts designated as net investment hedges, the Company excludes changes in fair value relating to changes in the forward carry component from its assessment of hedge effectiveness. Accordingly, any gains or losses related to this forward carry component are recognized in earnings in the current period. Fair Value Hedges Gains and losses related to changes in fair value hedges are recognized in earnings along with a corresponding loss or gain related to the change in value of the underlying hedged item in the same line in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For foreign exchange forward contracts designated as fair value hedges, the Company excludes changes in fair value relating to changes in the forward carry component from its assessment of hedge effectiveness. The amount excluded from the effectiveness testing of fair value hedges was a gain of $ 777 million for 2019 , and was recognized in OI&E. Non-Designated Derivatives Derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are adjusted to fair value through earnings in the financial statement line item to which the derivative relates. Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 40 The Company records all derivatives in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The Company’s accounting treatment for these derivative instruments is based on its hedge designation. The following tables show the Company’s derivative instruments at gross fair value as of September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018 (in millions): 2019 Fair Value of Derivatives Designated as Hedge Instruments Fair Value of Derivatives Not Designated as Hedge Instruments Total Fair Value Derivative assets (1) : Foreign exchange contracts $ 1,798 $ 323 $ 2,121 Interest rate contracts $ 685 $ — $ 685 Derivative liabilities (2) : Foreign exchange contracts $ 1,341 $ 160 $ 1,501 Interest rate contracts $ 105 $ — $ 105 2018 Fair Value of Derivatives Designated as Hedge Instruments Fair Value of Derivatives Not Designated as Hedge Instruments Total Fair Value Derivative assets (1) : Foreign exchange contracts $ 1,015 $ 259 $ 1,274 Derivative liabilities (2) : Foreign exchange contracts $ 543 $ 137 $ 680 Interest rate contracts $ 1,456 $ — $ 1,456 (1) The fair value of derivative assets is measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and is recorded as other current assets and other non-current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. (2) The fair value of derivative liabilities is measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and is recorded as other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company classifies cash flows related to derivative financial instruments as operating activities in its Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 41 The following table shows the pre-tax gains and losses of the Company’s derivative and non-derivative instruments designated as cash flow, net investment and fair value hedges in OCI and the Consolidated Statements of Operations for 2019 , 2018 and 2017 (in millions): 2019 2018 2017 Gains/(Losses) recognized in OCI – effective portion: Cash flow hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ ( 959 ) $ 682 $ 1,797 Interest rate contracts — 1 7 Total $ ( 959 ) $ 683 $ 1,804 Net investment hedges: Foreign currency debt $ ( 58 ) $ 4 $ 67 Gains/(Losses) reclassified from AOCI into net income – effective portion: Cash flow hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ ( 116 ) $ ( 482 ) $ 1,958 Interest rate contracts ( 7 ) 1 ( 2 ) Total $ ( 123 ) $ ( 481 ) $ 1,956 Gains/(Losses) on derivative instruments: Fair value hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ 1,020 $ ( 168 ) $ — Interest rate contracts 2,068 ( 1,363 ) ( 810 ) Total $ 3,088 $ ( 1,531 ) $ ( 810 ) Gains/(Losses) related to hedged items: Fair value hedges: Marketable securities $ ( 1,018 ) $ 167 $ — Fixed-rate debt ( 2,068 ) 1,363 810 Total $ ( 3,086 ) $ 1,530 $ 810 The following table shows the notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments and credit risk amounts associated with outstanding or unsettled derivative instruments as of September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018 (in millions): 2019 2018 Notional Amount Credit Risk Amount Notional Amount Credit Risk Amount Instruments designated as accounting hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ 61,795 $ 1,798 $ 65,368 $ 1,015 Interest rate contracts $ 31,250 $ 685 $ 33,250 $ — Instruments not designated as accounting hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ 76,868 $ 323 $ 63,062 $ 259 The notional amounts for outstanding derivative instruments provide one measure of the transaction volume outstanding and do not represent the amount of the Company’s exposure to credit or market loss. The credit risk amounts represent the Company’s gross exposure to potential accounting loss on derivative instruments that are outstanding or unsettled if all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current currency or interest rates at each respective date. The Company’s exposure to credit loss and market risk will vary over time as currency and interest rates change. Although the table above reflects the notional and credit risk amounts of the Company’s derivative instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses associated with the exposures and transactions that the instruments are intended to hedge. The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments. Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 42 The Company generally enters into master netting arrangements, which are designed to reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. The Company presents its derivative assets and derivative liabilities at their gross fair values in its Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of September 28, 2019 , the net cash collateral received by the Company related to derivative instruments under its collateral security arrangements was $ 1.6 billion , which was recorded as other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of September 29, 2018 , the net cash collateral posted by the Company related to derivative instruments under its collateral security arrangements was $ 1.0 billion , which was recorded as other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Under master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to the Company’s derivative contracts, the Company is allowed to net settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018 , the potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the Company’s derivative contracts, including the effects of collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $ 2.7 billion and $ 2.1 billion , respectively, resulting in a net derivative liability of $ 407 million and a net derivative asset of $ 138 million , respectively. Accounts Receivable Trade Receivables The Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, resellers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral or third-party credit support in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements. As of September 28, 2019 , the Company had no customers that individually represented 10% or more of total trade receivables. As of September 29, 2018 , the Company had one customer that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, which accounted for 10 % . The Company’s cellular network carriers accounted for 51 % and 59 % of total trade receivables as of September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018 , respectively. Vendor Non-Trade Receivables The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. As of September 28, 2019 , the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 59 % and 14 % . As of September 29, 2018 , the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 62 % and 12 % .

The Act lowered the Company’s U.S. statutory federal income tax rate from 35 % to 21 % effective January 1, 2018, while also imposing a deemed repatriation tax on previously deferred foreign income. The Act also created a new minimum tax on certain foreign earnings, for which the Company has elected to record certain deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Company completed its accounting for the income tax effects of the Act during 2019, in accordance with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118. Provision for Income Taxes and Effective Tax Rate The provision for income taxes for 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , consisted of the following (in millions): 2019 2018 2017 Federal: Current $ 6,384 $ 41,425 $ 7,842 Deferred ( 2,939 ) ( 33,819 ) 5,980 Total 3,445 7,606 13,822 State: Current 475 551 259 Deferred ( 67 ) 48 2 Total 408 599 261 Foreign: Current 3,962 3,986 1,671 Deferred 2,666 1,181 ( 16 ) Total 6,628 5,167 1,655 Provision for income taxes $ 10,481 $ 13,372 $ 15,738 The foreign provision for income taxes is based on foreign pre-tax earnings of $ 44.3 billion , $ 48.0 billion and $ 44.7 billion in 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 44 A reconciliation of the provision for income taxes, with the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate ( 21 % in 2019 ; 24.5 % in 2018 ; 35 % in 2017 ) to income before provision for income taxes for 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , is as follows (dollars in millions): 2019 2018 2017 Computed expected tax $ 13,805 $ 17,890 $ 22,431 State taxes, net of federal effect 423 271 185 Impacts of the Act — 1,515 — Earnings of foreign subsidiaries ( 2,625 ) ( 5,606 ) ( 6,135 ) Research and development credit, net ( 548 ) ( 560 ) ( 678 ) Excess tax benefits from equity awards ( 639 ) ( 675 ) — Other 65 537 ( 65 ) Provision for income taxes $ 10,481 $ 13,372 $ 15,738 Effective tax rate 15.9 % 18.3 % 24.6 % The Company’s income taxes payable have been reduced by the tax benefits from employee stock plan awards. For restricted stock units (“RSUs”), the Company receives an income tax benefit upon the award’s vesting equal to the tax effect of the underlying stock’s fair market value. Prior to 2018, the Company reflected net excess tax benefits from equity awards as increases to additional paid-in capital, which amounted to $ 620 million in 2017 . Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities As of September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018 , the significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities were (in millions): 2019 2018 Deferred tax assets: Amortization and depreciation $ 11,433 $ 137 Accrued liabilities and other reserves 5,389 3,151 Deferred revenue 1,372 1,141 Share-based compensation 749 513 Unrealized losses — 871 Other 697 797 Total deferred tax assets, net 19,640 6,610 Deferred tax liabilities: Minimum tax on foreign earnings 10,809 — Earnings of foreign subsidiaries 330 275 Other 456 501 Total deferred tax liabilities 11,595 776 Net deferred tax assets/(liabilities) $ 8,045 $ 5,834 Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the effects of tax credits and the future income tax effects of temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and are measured using enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 45 Uncertain Tax Positions As of September 28, 2019 , the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $ 15.6 billion , of which $ 8.6 billion , if recognized, would impact the Company’s effective tax rate. As of September 29, 2018 , the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $ 9.7 billion , of which $ 7.4 billion , if recognized, would have impacted the Company’s effective tax rate. The aggregate change in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which excludes interest and penalties, for 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , is as follows (in millions): 2019 2018 2017 Beginning balances $ 9,694 $ 8,407 $ 7,724 Increases related to tax positions taken during a prior year 5,845 2,431 333 Decreases related to tax positions taken during a prior year ( 686 ) ( 2,212 ) ( 952 ) Increases related to tax positions taken during the current year 1,697 1,824 1,880 Decreases related to settlements with taxing authorities ( 852 ) ( 756 ) ( 539 ) Decreases related to expiration of the statute of limitations ( 79 ) — ( 39 ) Ending balances $ 15,619 $ 9,694 $ 8,407 The Company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and many state and foreign jurisdictions. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) concluded its review of the years 2013 through 2015 in 2018, and all years before 2016 are closed. Tax years after 2014 remain open in certain major foreign jurisdictions and are subject to examination by the taxing authorities. The Company believes that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Company’s tax audits are resolved in a manner inconsistent with its expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs. Although the timing of resolution and/or closure of audits is not certain, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that its gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease in the next 12 months by as much as $ 2.0 billion . Interest and Penalties The Company includes interest and penalties related to income tax matters within the provision for income taxes. As of September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018 , the total amount of gross interest and penalties accrued was $ 1.3 billion and $ 1.4 billion , respectively. The Company recognized interest and penalty expense in 2019 , 2018 and 2017 of $ 73 million , $ 489 million and $ 238 million , respectively. European Commission State Aid Decision On August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company (the “State Aid Decision”). The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. The recovery amount was calculated to be € 13.1 billion , plus interest of € 1.2 billion . During the fourth quarter of 2019, the Irish Minister for Finance approved the Company’s request to reduce the recovery amount by € 190 million due to taxes paid to other countries, resulting in an adjusted recovery amount of € 12.9 billion as of September 28, 2019. Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The Company believes the State Aid Decision to be without merit and appealed to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union. Ireland has also appealed the State Aid Decision. The Company believes that any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision would be creditable against U.S. taxes, subject to any foreign tax credit limitations in the Act. As of September 28, 2019 , the entire adjusted recovery amount plus interest was funded into escrow, where it will remain restricted from general use pending the conclusion of all appeals.

Note 7 – Shareholders’ Equity Share Repurchase Program On April 30, 2019, the Company announced the Board of Directors increased the current share repurchase program authorization from $ 100 billion to $ 175 billion of the Company’s common stock, of which $ 96.1 billion had been utilized as of September 28, 2019 . During 2019 , the Company repurchased 345.2 million shares of its common stock for $ 67.1 billion , including 62.0 million shares delivered under a $ 12.0 billion accelerated share repurchase arrangement dated February 2019, which settled in August 2019. The Company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. Under this program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Shares of Common Stock The following table shows the changes in shares of common stock for 2019 , 2018 and 2017 (in thousands): 2019 2018 2017 Common stock outstanding, beginning balances 4,754,986 5,126,201 5,336,166 Common stock repurchased ( 345,205 ) ( 405,549 ) ( 246,496 ) Common stock issued, net of shares withheld for employee taxes 33,455 34,334 36,531 Common stock outstanding, ending balances 4,443,236 4,754,986 5,126,201 Note 8 – Comprehensive Income The Company’s OCI consists of foreign currency translation adjustments from those subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, net deferred gains and losses on certain derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges and unrealized gains and losses on marketable debt securities classified as available-for-sale. The following table shows the pre-tax amounts reclassified from AOCI into the Consolidated Statements of Operations, and the associated financial statement line item, for 2019 and 2018 (in millions): Comprehensive Income Components Financial Statement Line Item 2019 2018 Unrealized (gains)/losses on derivative instruments: Foreign exchange contracts Total net sales $ ( 206 ) $ 214 Total cost of sales ( 482 ) ( 70 ) Other income/(expense), net 784 344 Interest rate contracts Other income/(expense), net 7 ( 2 ) 103 486 Unrealized (gains)/losses on marketable securities Other income/(expense), net 31 ( 20 ) Total amounts reclassified from AOCI $ 134 $ 466 Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 48 The following table shows the changes in AOCI by component for 2019 and 2018 (in millions): Cumulative Foreign Currency Translation Unrealized Gains/Losses on Derivative Instruments Unrealized Gains/Losses on Marketable Securities Total Balances as of September 30, 2017 $ ( 354 ) $ ( 124 ) $ 328 $ ( 150 ) Other comprehensive income/(loss) before reclassifications ( 524 ) 672 ( 4,563 ) ( 4,415 ) Amounts reclassified from AOCI — 486 ( 20 ) 466 Tax effect ( 1 ) ( 253 ) 1,177 923 Other comprehensive income/(loss) ( 525 ) 905 ( 3,406 ) ( 3,026 ) Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle ( 176 ) 29 ( 131 ) ( 278 ) Balances as of September 29, 2018 ( 1,055 ) 810 ( 3,209 ) ( 3,454 ) Other comprehensive income/(loss) before reclassifications ( 421 ) ( 949 ) 4,854 3,484 Amounts reclassified from AOCI — 103 31 134 Tax effect 13 208 ( 1,058 ) ( 837 ) Other comprehensive income/(loss) ( 408 ) ( 638 ) 3,827 2,781 Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle (1) — — 89 89 Balances as of September 28, 2019 $ ( 1,463 ) $ 172 $ 707 $ ( 584 ) (1) Refer to Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” for more information on the Company’s adoption of ASU 2016-01 in 2019. Note 9 – Benefit Plans 2014 Employee Stock Plan In the second quarter of 2014, shareholders approved the 2014 Employee Stock Plan (the “2014 Plan”) and terminated the Company’s authority to grant new awards under the 2003 Employee Stock Plan (the “2003 Plan”). The 2014 Plan provides for broad-based equity grants to employees, including executive officers, and permits the granting of RSUs, stock grants, performance-based awards, stock options and stock appreciation rights, as well as cash bonus awards. RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan generally vest over four years , based on continued employment, and are settled upon vesting in shares of the Company’s common stock on a one -for-one basis. RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan reduce the number of shares available for grant under the plan by a factor of two times the number of RSUs granted. RSUs canceled and shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations increase the number of shares available for grant under the 2014 Plan utilizing a factor of two times the number of RSUs canceled or shares withheld. Currently, all RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan have dividend equivalent rights (“DERs”), which entitle holders of RSUs to the same dividend value per share as holders of common stock. DERs are subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the corresponding unvested RSUs. DERs are accumulated and paid when the underlying shares vest. Upon approval of the 2014 Plan, the Company reserved 385 million shares plus the number of shares remaining that were reserved but not issued under the 2003 Plan. Shares subject to outstanding awards under the 2003 Plan that expire, are canceled or otherwise terminate, or are withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations for RSUs, will also be available for awards under the 2014 Plan. As of September 28, 2019 , approximately 246.4 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the 2014 Plan. Apple Inc. Non-Employee Director Stock Plan The Apple Inc. Non-Employee Director Stock Plan (the “Director Plan”) is a shareholder-approved plan that (i) permits the Company to grant awards of RSUs or stock options to the Company’s non-employee directors, (ii) provides for automatic initial grants of RSUs upon a non-employee director joining the Board of Directors and automatic annual grants of RSUs at each annual meeting of shareholders, and (iii) permits the Board of Directors to prospectively change the value and relative mixture of stock options and RSUs for the initial and annual award grants and the methodology for determining the number of shares of the Company’s common stock subject to these grants, in each case within the limits set forth in the Director Plan and without further shareholder approval. RSUs granted under the Director Plan reduce the number of shares available for grant under the plan by a factor of two times the number of RSUs granted. The Director Plan expires on November 12, 2027 . All RSUs granted under the Director Plan are entitled to DERs. DERs are subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the corresponding unvested RSUs. DERs are accumulated and paid when the underlying shares vest. As of September 28, 2019 , approximately 1.1 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the Director Plan. Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 49 Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans During the three months ended September 28, 2019 , Section 16 officers Timothy D. Cook, Chris Kondo, Luca Maestri, Deirdre O’Brien and Jeffrey Williams had equity trading plans in place in accordance with Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) under the Exchange Act. An equity trading plan is a written document that pre-establishes the amounts, prices and dates (or formula for determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of the Company’s stock, including shares acquired under the Company’s employee and director equity plans. Employee Stock Purchase Plan The Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “Purchase Plan”) is a shareholder-approved plan under which substantially all employees may purchase the Company’s common stock through payroll deductions at a price equal to 85 % of the lower of the fair market values of the stock as of the beginning or the end of six-month offering periods. An employee’s payroll deductions under the Purchase Plan are limited to 10 % of the employee’s compensation and employees may not purchase more than $ 25,000 of stock during any calendar year. As of September 28, 2019 , approximately 31.1 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the Purchase Plan. 401(k) Plan The Company’s 401(k) Plan is a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the 401(k) Plan, participating U.S. employees may defer a portion of their pre-tax earnings, up to the IRS annual contribution limit ( $ 19,000 for calendar year 2019 ). The Company matches 50 % to 100 % of each employee’s contributions, depending on length of service, up to a maximum of 6 % of the employee’s eligible earnings. Restricted Stock Units A summary of the Company’s RSU activity and related information for 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , is as follows: Number of RSUs (in thousands) Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value Per RSU Aggregate Fair Value (in millions) Balance as of September 24, 2016 99,089 $ 97.54 RSUs granted 50,112 $ 121.65 RSUs vested ( 45,735 ) $ 95.48 RSUs canceled ( 5,895 ) $ 106.87 Balance as of September 30, 2017 97,571 $ 110.33 RSUs granted 45,351 $ 162.86 RSUs vested ( 44,718 ) $ 111.24 RSUs canceled ( 6,049 ) $ 127.82 Balance as of September 29, 2018 92,155 $ 134.60 RSUs granted 36,852 $ 215.95 RSUs vested ( 42,088 ) $ 135.21 RSUs canceled ( 5,402 ) $ 162.85 Balance as of September 28, 2019 81,517 $ 169.18 $ 17,838 The fair value as of the respective vesting dates of RSUs was $ 8.6 billion , $ 7.6 billion and $ 6.1 billion for 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The majority of RSUs that vested in 2019 , 2018 and 2017 were net share settled such that the Company withheld shares with a value equivalent to the employees’ obligation for the applicable income and other employment taxes, and remitted the cash to the appropriate taxing authorities. The total shares withheld were approximately 14.8 million , 16.0 million and 15.4 million for 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively, and were based on the value of the RSUs on their respective vesting dates as determined by the Company’s closing stock price. Total payments for the employees’ tax obligations to taxing authorities were $ 3.0 billion , $ 2.7 billion and $ 2.0 billion in 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. These net share settlements had the effect of share repurchases by the Company as they reduced the number of shares that would have otherwise been issued as a result of the vesting and did not represent an expense to the Company. Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 50 Share-Based Compensation The following table shows share-based compensation expense and the related income tax benefit included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for 2019 , 2018 and 2017 (in millions): 2019 2018 2017 Share-based compensation expense $ 6,068 $ 5,340 $ 4,840 Income tax benefit related to share-based compensation expense $ ( 1,967 ) $ ( 1,893 ) $ ( 1,632 ) As of September 28, 2019 , the total unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding RSUs and stock options was $ 10.5 billion , which the Company expects to recognize over a weighted-average period of 2.5 years . Note 10 – Commitments and Contingencies Accrued Warranty and Guarantees The following table shows changes in the Company’s accrued warranties and related costs for 2019 , 2018 and 2017 (in millions): 2019 2018 2017 Beginning accrued warranty and related costs $ 3,692 $ 3,834 $ 3,702 Cost of warranty claims ( 3,857 ) ( 4,115 ) ( 4,322 ) Accruals for product warranty 3,735 3,973 4,454 Ending accrued warranty and related costs $ 3,570 $ 3,692 $ 3,834 The Company offers an iPhone Upgrade Program, which is available to customers who purchase a qualifying iPhone in the U.S., the U.K. and mainland China. The iPhone Upgrade Program provides customers the right to trade in that iPhone for a specified amount when purchasing a new iPhone, provided certain conditions are met. The Company accounts for the trade-in right as a guarantee liability and recognizes arrangement revenue net of the fair value of such right, with subsequent changes to the guarantee liability recognized within net sales. Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product Although most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets and other electronic devices. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements. The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Substantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia, with some Mac computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland. Other Off–Balance Sheet Commitments Operating Leases The Company leases various equipment and facilities, including retail space, under noncancelable operating lease arrangements. The Company does not currently utilize any other off–balance sheet financing arrangements. As of September 28, 2019 , the Company’s total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases were $ 10.8 billion . The Company’s retail store and other facility leases typically have original terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multi-year renewal options. Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 51 Rent expense under all operating leases, including both cancelable and noncancelable leases, was $ 1.3 billion , $ 1.2 billion and $ 1.1 billion in 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases having initial or remaining terms in excess of one year as of September 28, 2019 , are as follows (in millions): 2020 $ 1,306 2021 1,276 2022 1,137 2023 912 2024 834 Thereafter 5,373 Total $ 10,838 Unconditional Purchase Obligations The Company has entered into certain off–balance sheet commitments that require the future purchase of goods or services (“unconditional purchase obligations”). The Company’s unconditional purchase obligations primarily consist of payments for supplier arrangements, Internet and telecommunication services, intellectual property licenses and content creation. Future payments under noncancelable unconditional purchase obligations having a remaining term in excess of one year as of September 28, 2019 , are as follows (in millions): 2020 $ 2,476 2021 2,386 2022 1,859 2023 1,162 2024 218 Thereafter 110 Total $ 8,211 Contingencies The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully resolved. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims, except for the following matters: VirnetX VirnetX, Inc. (“VirnetX”) filed two lawsuits in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas (the “Eastern Texas District Court”) against the Company alleging that certain Company products infringe four patents (the “VirnetX Patents”) relating to network communications technology (“VirnetX I” and “VirnetX II”). On September 30, 2016, a jury returned a verdict in VirnetX I against the Company and awarded damages of $ 302 million , which later increased to $ 440 million in post-trial proceedings. The Company appealed the VirnetX I verdict to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (the “Federal Circuit”). On April 11, 2018, a jury returned a verdict in VirnetX II against the Company and awarded damages of $ 503 million . VirnetX II is currently on appeal. The Company has challenged the validity of the VirnetX Patents at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the “PTO”). In response, the PTO has declared the VirnetX Patents invalid. VirnetX appealed the invalidity decision of the PTO to the Federal Circuit. The Federal Circuit consolidated the Company’s appeal of the Eastern Texas District Court VirnetX I verdict and VirnetX’s appeals from the PTO invalidity proceedings. On January 15, 2019, the Federal Circuit affirmed the VirnetX I verdict, which the Company intends to further appeal. On July 8, 2019, the Federal Circuit remanded one of VirnetX’s two appeals of the PTO’s invalidity decisions back to the PTO for further proceedings. On August 1, 2019, the Federal Circuit affirmed-in-part, vacated-in-part, and remanded back to the PTO portions of VirnetX’s second appeal. The Company has accrued its best estimate for the ultimate resolution of these matters. Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 52 Qualcomm On January 20, 2017, the Company filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm Incorporated and affiliated parties (“Qualcomm”) in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California seeking, among other things, to enjoin Qualcomm from requiring the Company to pay royalties at the rate demanded by Qualcomm. No Qualcomm-related royalty payments had been remitted by the Company to its contract manufacturers since the beginning of the second quarter of 2017. Following the Company’s lawsuit, Qualcomm filed patent infringement suits against the Company and its affiliates in the U.S. and various international jurisdictions, some of which sought to enjoin the sale of certain of the Company’s products in particular countries. On April 16, 2019, the Company and Qualcomm reached a settlement agreement to dismiss all litigation between the two companies worldwide. The companies also reached a multi-year license agreement and a multi-year supply agreement. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, Apple made a payment to Qualcomm to, among other things, resolve disputes over the withheld royalty payments. iOS Performance Management Cases Various civil litigation matters have been filed in state and federal courts in the U.S. and in various international jurisdictions alleging violation of consumer protection laws, fraud, computer intrusion and other causes of action related to the Company’s performance management feature used in its iPhone operating systems, introduced to certain iPhones in iOS updates 10.2.1 and 11.2. The claims seek monetary damages and other non-monetary relief. On April 5, 2018, several U.S. federal actions were consolidated through a Multidistrict Litigation process into a single action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. In addition to civil litigation, the Company is also responding to governmental investigations and requests for information relating to the performance management feature. The Company believes that its iPhones were not defective, that the performance management feature introduced with iOS updates 10.2.1 and 11.2 was intended to, and did, improve customers’ user experience, and that the Company did not make any misleading statements or fail to disclose any material information. The Company has accrued its best estimate for the ultimate resolution of these matters. French Competition Authority In June 2019, the French Competition Authority (“FCA”) issued a report alleging that aspects of the Company’s sales and distribution practices in France violate French competition law. The Company vigorously disagrees with the allegations, and a hearing of arguments was held before the FCA on October 15, 2019. The Company is awaiting the decision of the FCA, which may include a fine. Note 11 – Segment Information and Geographic Data The Company reports segment information based on the “management” approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company’s reportable segments. The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described in Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.” The Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company’s retail stores located in those geographic locations. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the reportable segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as research and development, corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges and other separately managed general and administrative costs. The Company does not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes.

Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 55 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Apple Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Apple Inc. as of September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018 , the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 28, 2019 , and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Apple Inc. at September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018 , and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 28, 2019 , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the “PCAOB”), Apple Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 28, 2019 , based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated October 30, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of Apple Inc.’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Apple Inc.’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Apple Inc. in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates. European Commission State Aid Matter Uncertain Tax Position Description of the Matter As discussed in Note 5 of the financial statements, the European Commission (“EC”) has announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to Apple Inc. by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of Apple Inc. The decision ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from Apple Inc. for the period from June 2003 through December 2014. The adjusted amount indicated by the EC to be recovered is up to €12.9 billion, plus interest. Auditing management’s evaluation of the uncertain tax position stemming from the effects of the EC decision is complex and highly judgmental due to the inherent uncertainty in predicting the ultimate resolution of the matter. Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 56 How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We tested controls over the risk of material misstatement relating to the evaluation of the EC state aid matter, including management’s evaluation of the advice of legal counsel, the assessment as to whether Apple Inc.’s position is more likely than not to be sustained and the development of the related disclosure. To evaluate Apple Inc.’s assessment of whether sustainment of its position is a more likely than not outcome, including underlying assumptions, our audit procedures included, among others, reading the EC August 2016 ruling and available correspondence between Apple Inc. and the EC, and the EC and Ireland. We also requested and received internal and external legal counsel confirmation letters, discussed the allegations with internal and external legal counsel and Apple Inc. tax personnel and obtained a representation letter from Apple Inc. We involved our EC and tax subject matter resources in considering the applicable tax laws, the pending appeal, the current status of legal precedent relevant to that appeal and the proceedings at the court hearing in September 2019. In addition, we evaluated Apple Inc.’s disclosure included in Note 5 in relation to this matter. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP We have served as Apple Inc.’s auditor since 2009. San Jose, California October 30, 2019 Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 57 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Apple Inc. Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have audited Apple Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 28, 2019 , based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the “COSO criteria”). In our opinion, Apple Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 28, 2019 , based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the “PCAOB”), the consolidated balance sheets of Apple Inc. as of September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018 , the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 28, 2019 , and the related notes and our report dated October 30, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion Apple Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Apple Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Apple Inc. in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP San Jose, California October 30, 2019 Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 58 Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure None. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act were effective as of September 28, 2019 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Inherent Limitations over Internal Controls The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company’s assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that the Company’s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company’s management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company’s internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on the Company’s assessment, management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 28, 2019 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, which appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2019 , which were identified in connection with management’s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
