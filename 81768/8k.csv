Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition. On January 8, 2024, members of the senior management team of CVS Health Corporation (“CVS Health,” the “Company,” “we” or “our”) will meet with investors and will participate in a webcast at 10:30 a.m. (Eastern Time) . During the meetings and webcast, the senior management team will reaffirm the Company’s previously announced full-year 2023 GAAP diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) guidance range of $6.37 to $6.61 and its full-year 2023 Adjusted EPS guidance range of $8.50 to $8.70. The Company expects its full-year 2023 Adjusted EPS to be in the upper half of the guidance range. In addition, the Company will reaffirm its full-year 2023 cash flow from operations guidance at the upper end of its $12.5 billion to $13.5 billion guidance range. The Company will reaffirm its previously announced full-year 2024 GAAP diluted EPS guidance of at least $7.26, its full-year 2024 Adjusted EPS guidance of at least $8.50 and its full-year 2024 cash flow from operations guidance of at least $12.5 billion . During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company entered into a $3.0 billion fixed dollar accelerated share repurchase transaction, which became effective on January 3, 2024. We expect our total Medicare Advantage (“MA”) membership to grow by at least 800,000 in 2024. During the annual enrollment period for 2024, our Individual MA and dual eligible special needs enrollment exceeded our expectations. Our stronger than expected 2024 MA enrollment is driven by factors including strong new sales and retention of existing Aetna MA members, with a higher than historical proportion of new sales coming from competitor MA plans. An audio webcast of the presentation will be broadcast simultaneously for all interested parties through the Investor Relations portion of the CVS Health website at http://investors.cvshealth.com. The accompanying presentation materials are available on the website and will be archived for one year along with a replay of the webcast. Our financial closing procedures for the full-year 2023 are not yet complete and, as a result, our actual results may change as a result of such financial closing procedures, final adjustments, management’s review of results, and other developments that may arise between now and the time our financial results for the full-year 2023 are finalized, and our results could be outside of the ranges set forth above. Non-GAAP Financial Measures This Current Report on Form 8-K includes estimated and projected Adjusted EPS, which represent non-GAAP financial measures. The Company uses non-GAAP financial measures to analyze underlying business performance and trends. The Company believes that providing non-GAAP financial measures enhances the Company’s and investors’ ability to compare the Company’s past financial performance with its current performance. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures determined or calculated in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s definitions of its non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The most directly comparable GAAP measures are estimated and projected GAAP diluted EPS. Estimated and projected GAAP diluted EPS and estimated and projected Adjusted EPS, respectively, are calculated by dividing estimated or projected net income attributable to CVS Health and estimated or projected adjusted income attributable to CVS Health by the Company’s estimated or projected weighted average diluted shares outstanding. The Company defines adjusted income attributable to CVS Health as net income attributable to CVS Health (GAAP measure) excluding the impact of amortization of intangible assets, net realized capital gains or losses and other items, if any, that neither relate to the ordinary course of the Company’s business nor reflect the Company’s underlying business performance, such as acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, restructuring charges, office real estate optimization charges, losses on assets held for sale, as well as the corresponding tax benefit or expense related to the items excluded from adjusted income attributable to CVS Health and certain discrete tax items. The following are reconciliations of projected GAAP diluted EPS to projected Adjusted EPS: Year Ending December 31, Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers. Appointment of Thomas F. Cowhey as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer The Board of Directors (the “Board”) of CVS Health appointed Thomas F. Cowhey to serve as CVS Health’s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, effective January 5, 2024. Mr. Cowhey has been serving as CVS Health’s interim Chief Financial Officer since October 13, 2023. Mr. Cowhey’s business experience was previously disclosed in Item 5.02 of CVS Health’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed on October 16, 2023. In connection with his appointment, Mr. Cowhey will receive a base salary of $1 million and will be eligible for a target annual cash incentive of 150% of eligible earnings and target annual equity award of $5.5 million. The equity award will have the same terms and form as CVS Health’s annual equity awards and will be granted on April 1, 2024, the terms and form of which will be determined by the Management Planning and Development Committee of the Board in the ordinary course in February and March 2024. Mr. Cowhey has also entered into CVS Health’s customary change in control agreement for executives and a restrictive covenant agreement which includes, among other things, non-competition and non-solicitation covenants for the 18-month period following his employment with CVS Health. Departure of Shawn M. Guertin as Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and President of Health Services On January 5, 2024, CVS Health also announced that Shawn M.

Lynch. “The combination of our businesses, and the key growth areas we have invested in, drive our ability to lower the total cost of care, improve health outcomes, and deliver on our commitments to our customers, consumers, and shareholders.” Introducing CVS CostVantage, a more transparent and sustainable model for retail pharmacy CVS Pharmacy today announced CVS CostVantage, a new approach that evolves the traditional pharmacy reimbursement model and brings greater transparency and simplicity to the system. CVS CostVantage will define the drug cost and related reimbursement with contracted pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) and payors, using a transparent formula built on the cost of the drug, a set markup, and a fee that reflects the care and value of pharmacy services. These changes will also help ensure that CVS Pharmacy locations will continue to be a critical touchpoint for consumers to access affordable health care in their communities. “We are leading with an approach that will shift how our retail pharmacy is compensated by implementing a more transparent and sustainable model that fairly aligns pharmacy reimbursement to the quality services we provide,” said Prem Shah, PharmD, executive vice president, Chief Pharmacy Officer and President, Pharmacy and Consumer Wellness, CVS Health. “It provides our PBM and payor clients a foundational step towards more pricing clarity for consumers.” CVS Pharmacy plans to launch CVS CostVantage with PBMs for their commercial payors in 2025, working together to ensure a smooth transition. 1 Following on from the launch of its Choice Formulary program earlier this year, CVS Caremark today introduces TrueCost, a model innovation that offers client pricing reflecting the true net cost of prescription drugs, with visibility into administrative fees. Simplified pricing will help consumers be confident that their pharmacy benefit is providing the best possible price and will allow members to have stable access to our national pharmacy network. Through this approach, clients will have the flexibility to choose a pharmacy benefit model that works best for the unique needs of their members and plan, and CVS Caremark TrueCost provides another valuable option for them. CVS Caremark plans to launch CVS Caremark TrueCost in 2025. Launching CVS Healthspire to define Health Services segment To help demonstrate the connection and convenience CVS Health uniquely delivers, CVS Healthspire will be the new branded name for the company’s Health Services segment, including Caremark, Cordavis TM , Oak Street Health ® , Signify Health ® , and MinuteClinic ® . The groups within CVS Healthspire will continue to focus on integration across the company’s assets to deliver connected patient care, pharmacy benefits, and innovative provider support solutions in communities across the country, making expert care simple, more accessible, and more affordable. The CVS Healthspire brand will begin to roll out publicly this month and advance throughout 2024. Consumers will initially see “Part of CVS Healthspire” appear on select CVS Health care delivery offerings across digital and physical assets as the company continues to create an integrated ecosystem for patients. “Delivering care in a more integrated way - especially for complex patients with chronic health conditions - improves health outcomes and the patient experience,” said Mike Pykosz, CEO of Oak Street Health and interim president of Health Care Delivery. “We are already seeing the benefits of our value-based model to lower the total cost of care for customers, clients, and patients, and we believe we will build on these results as we more fully integrate with our core businesses.” Accelerating momentum through combined strength and innovation of leading businesses While CVS Health’s business segments continue to be successful and profitable on their own, there is a sizable opportunity to continue strengthening these connections and create incremental value for the overall company. A notable example was the recent improvement of Aetna’s Medicare Advantage Star Ratings. In just a year, by leveraging the power of the company’s cross-enterprise assets and executional excellence, Aetna was able to achieve 87% of their members in four star plans or better for the 2025 plan year, a recovery from 21% in the previous year. “This achievement was due to the work across our Aetna, CVS Pharmacy, and CVS Caremark colleagues. Even more important than our ratings, these teams worked together to help members improve medication adherence and overcome barriers such as costs and transportation,” said Lynch. “Our strong performance in this area shows how we can quickly unite our businesses to achieve important common goals.” Reiterating 2023 financial guidance, announcing 2024 full-year projections CVS Health interim CFO Tom Cowhey will detail the company’s 2024 financial outlook, capital deployment strategy, and long-term outlook and growth targets. The company’s unique combination of assets provides CVS Health with clear opportunities for long-term outperformance, including through Medicare Advantage margin recovery, incorporating Star Ratings, starting in 2025; CVS CostVantage, the company’s new retail pharmacy pricing model; increased patient enrollment in Oak Street Health; expanded product offerings through Signify Health; and enhanced growth in core businesses from new offerings in health care delivery. “By broadening our portfolio of integrated products and services, we expect to create a path to sustainable, profitable growth,” Cowhey said. “Our powerful cash generation capabilities will support our strategic goals, prudent capital deployment, and attractive return profile – while also providing opportunities for meaningful long-term outperformance.” 2 2023 Guidance Today, the company is reiterating its 2023 guidance as shared on its November 1, 2023 earnings call: • Total revenues: $351.5 to $357.3 billion • Operating income: $13.6 to $14.0 billion • Adjusted operating income: $17.2 to $17.6 billion • GAAP diluted earnings per share (“EPS”): $6.37 to $6.61 • Adjusted EPS: $8.50 to $8.70 • Cash flow from operations: Upper-end of $12.5 to $13.5 billion 2024 Guidance The company is initiating its 2024 full-year projections: • Total revenues: At least $366.0 billion • Operating income: At least $15.0 billion • Adjusted operating income: At least $17.2 billion • GAAP diluted EPS: At least $7.26 • Adjusted EPS: At least $8.50 • Cash flow from operations: At least $12.5 billion Announcement of increased quarterly dividend CVS Health has announced that its board of directors has approved a quarterly dividend of sixty-six and a half cents ($0.665 cents) per share, an approximate 10% increase from sixty and a half cents ($0.605 cents) per share.

Media contact Ethan Slavin 860-273-6095 SlavinE@CVSHealth.com Investor contact Larry McGrath 800-201-0938 InvestorInfo@CVSHealth.com 4 Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to the Most Directly Comparable GAAP Financial Measures Adjusted Operating Income (Unaudited) The Company defines adjusted operating income as operating income (GAAP measure) excluding the impact of amortization of intangible assets, net realized capital gains or losses and other items, if any, that neither relate to the ordinary course of the Company’s business nor reflect the Company’s underlying business performance, such as acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, restructuring charges, office real estate optimization charges, losses on assets held for sale, opioid litigation charges and gains/losses on divestitures. The Company uses adjusted operating income as its principal measure of segment performance as it enhances the Company’s ability to compare past financial performance with current performance and analyze underlying business performance and trends. The consolidated measure is not determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, consolidated operating income. The following are reconciliations of projected operating income to projected adjusted operating income: Year Ending December 31, 2024E 2023E 2022 In millions At Least Low High Actual Operating income (GAAP measure) $ 15,009 $ 13,587 $ 13,992 $ 7,954 Amortization of intangible assets 2,000 1,915 1,895 1,785 Net realized capital (gains) losses — 345 345 320 Acquisition-related transaction and integration costs (1) 230 440 420 — Restructuring charges (2) — 507 507 — Office real estate optimization charges (3) — 70 60 117 Loss on assets held for sale (4) — 349 349 2,533 Opioid litigation charges (5) — — — 5,803 Gain on divestiture of subsidiaries (6) — — — (475) Adjusted operating income $ 17,239 $ 17,213 $ 17,568 $ 18,037 (1) During 2024 and 2023, the acquisition-related transaction and integration costs relate to the acquisitions of Signify Health, Inc. (“Signify Health”) and Oak Street Health, Inc. (“Oak Street Health”). (2) During 2023, the restructuring charges are primarily comprised of severance and employee-related costs, asset impairment charges and a stock-based compensation charge. During the second quarter of 2023, the Company developed an enterprise-wide restructuring plan intended to streamline and simplify the organization, improve efficiency and reduce costs. In connection with the development of this plan and the recently completed acquisitions of Signify Health and Oak Street Health, the Company also conducted a strategic review of its various transformation initiatives and determined that it would terminate certain initiatives. (3) During 2023 and 2022, the office real estate optimization charges primarily relate to the abandonment of leased real estate and the related right-of-use assets and property and equipment in connection with the planned reduction of corporate office real estate space in response to the Company’s new flexible work arrangement. (4) During 2023 and 2022, the loss on assets held for sale relates to the Company’s Omnicare ® long-term care business (“LTC business”) reporting unit within the Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment. During 2022, the Company determined that its LTC business was no longer a strategic asset and committed to a plan to sell it, at which time the LTC business met the criteria for held-for-sale accounting and its net assets were accounted for as assets held for sale. The carrying value of the LTC business was determined to be greater than its estimated fair value less costs to sell and, accordingly, the Company recorded a loss on assets held for sale during the year ended December 31, 2022. During the first quarter of 2023, a loss on assets held for sale was recorded to write down the carrying value of the LTC business to the Company’s best estimate of the ultimate selling price which reflects its estimated fair value less costs to sell. As of September 30, 2023, the Company determined the LTC business no longer met the criteria for held-for-sale accounting and accordingly the net assets associated with the LTC business were reclassified to held and used at their respective fair values. During 2022, the loss on assets held for sale also relates to the Company’s international health care business domiciled in Thailand (“Thailand business”), which was included in the Commercial Business reporting unit in the Health Care Benefits segment. The sale of the Thailand business closed in the second quarter of 2022, and the ultimate loss on the sale was not material. (5) During 2022, the opioid litigation charges relate to agreements to resolve substantially all opioid claims against the Company by certain states and governmental entities. (6) During 2022, the gain on divestiture of subsidiaries represents the pre-tax gain on the sale of wholly-owned subsidiary bswift LLC (“bswift”), which the Company sold in November 2022, and the pre-tax gain on the sale of PayFlex Holdings, Inc. (“PayFlex”), which the Company sold in June 2022. 5 Adjusted Earnings Per Share (Unaudited) GAAP diluted Earnings Per Share (“EPS”) and Adjusted EPS, respectively, are calculated by dividing income from continuing operations attributable to CVS Health and adjusted income from continuing operations attributable to CVS Health by the Company’s weighted average diluted shares outstanding. The Company defines adjusted income from continuing operations attributable to CVS Health as income from continuing operations attributable to CVS Health (GAAP measure) excluding the impact of amortization of intangible assets, net realized capital gains or losses and other items, if any, that neither relate to the ordinary course of the Company’s business nor reflect the Company’s underlying business performance, such as acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, restructuring charges, office real estate optimization charges, losses on assets held for sale, opioid litigation charges, gains/losses on divestitures, as well as the corresponding tax benefit or expense related to the items excluded from adjusted income attributable to CVS Health and certain discrete tax items. The following are reconciliations of projected GAAP diluted EPS to projected Adjusted EPS : Year Ending December 31, 2024E 2023E 2022 At Least Low High Actual In millions, except per share amounts Per Common Share Net income attributable to CVS Health (GAAP measure) $ 7.26 $ 6.37 $ 6.61 $ 3.26 Non-GAAP adjustments: Amortization of intangible assets 1.58 1.48 1.47 1.35 Net realized capital (gains) losses — 0.27 0.27 0.24 Acquisition-related transaction and integration costs (1) 0.18 0.34 0.32 — Restructuring charges (2) — 0.39 0.39 — Office real estate optimization charges (3) — 0.06 0.05 0.09 Loss on assets held for sale (4) — 0.27 0.27 1.91 Opioid litigation charges (5) — — — 4.39 Gain on divestiture of subsidiaries (6) — — — (0.36) Tax impact of non-GAAP adjustments (7) (0.52) (0.68) (0.68) (1.85) Adjusted income attributable to CVS Health $ 8.50 $ 8.50 $ 8.70 $ 9.03 Weighted average diluted shares outstanding 1,263 1,291 1,291 1,323 (1) During 2024 and 2023, the acquisition-related transaction and integration costs relate to the acquisitions of Signify Health and Oak Street Health.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures This press release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share. In accordance with SEC regulations, you can find the definitions of the non-GAAP items mentioned, as well as the reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, below in this press release. Media contact Ethan Slavin 860-273-6095 SlavinE@CVSHealth.com Investor contact Larry McGrath 800-201-0938 InvestorInfo@CVSHealth.com 4 Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to the Most Directly Comparable GAAP Financial Measures Adjusted Operating Income (Unaudited) The Company defines adjusted operating income as operating income (GAAP measure) excluding the impact of amortization of intangible assets, net realized capital gains or losses and other items, if any, that neither relate to the ordinary course of the Company’s business nor reflect the Company’s underlying business performance, such as acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, restructuring charges, office real estate optimization charges, losses on assets held for sale, opioid litigation charges and gains/losses on divestitures. The Company uses adjusted operating income as its principal measure of segment performance as it enhances the Company’s ability to compare past financial performance with current performance and analyze underlying business performance and trends. The consolidated measure is not determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, consolidated operating income. The following are reconciliations of projected operating income to projected adjusted operating income: Year Ending December 31, 2024E 2023E 2022 In millions At Least Low High Actual Operating income (GAAP measure) $ 15,009 $ 13,587 $ 13,992 $ 7,954 Amortization of intangible assets 2,000 1,915 1,895 1,785 Net realized capital (gains) losses — 345 345 320 Acquisition-related transaction and integration costs (1) 230 440 420 — Restructuring charges (2) — 507 507 — Office real estate optimization charges (3) — 70 60 117 Loss on assets held for sale (4) — 349 349 2,533 Opioid litigation charges (5) — — — 5,803 Gain on divestiture of subsidiaries (6) — — — (475) Adjusted operating income $ 17,239 $ 17,213 $ 17,568 $ 18,037 (1) During 2024 and 2023, the acquisition-related transaction and integration costs relate to the acquisitions of Signify Health, Inc. (“Signify Health”) and Oak Street Health, Inc. (“Oak Street Health”). (2) During 2023, the restructuring charges are primarily comprised of severance and employee-related costs, asset impairment charges and a stock-based compensation charge. During the second quarter of 2023, the Company developed an enterprise-wide restructuring plan intended to streamline and simplify the organization, improve efficiency and reduce costs. In connection with the development of this plan and the recently completed acquisitions of Signify Health and Oak Street Health, the Company also conducted a strategic review of its various transformation initiatives and determined that it would terminate certain initiatives. (3) During 2023 and 2022, the office real estate optimization charges primarily relate to the abandonment of leased real estate and the related right-of-use assets and property and equipment in connection with the planned reduction of corporate office real estate space in response to the Company’s new flexible work arrangement. (4) During 2023 and 2022, the loss on assets held for sale relates to the Company’s Omnicare ® long-term care business (“LTC business”) reporting unit within the Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment. During 2022, the Company determined that its LTC business was no longer a strategic asset and committed to a plan to sell it, at which time the LTC business met the criteria for held-for-sale accounting and its net assets were accounted for as assets held for sale. The carrying value of the LTC business was determined to be greater than its estimated fair value less costs to sell and, accordingly, the Company recorded a loss on assets held for sale during the year ended December 31, 2022. During the first quarter of 2023, a loss on assets held for sale was recorded to write down the carrying value of the LTC business to the Company’s best estimate of the ultimate selling price which reflects its estimated fair value less costs to sell. As of September 30, 2023, the Company determined the LTC business no longer met the criteria for held-for-sale accounting and accordingly the net assets associated with the LTC business were reclassified to held and used at their respective fair values. During 2022, the loss on assets held for sale also relates to the Company’s international health care business domiciled in Thailand (“Thailand business”), which was included in the Commercial Business reporting unit in the Health Care Benefits segment. The sale of the Thailand business closed in the second quarter of 2022, and the ultimate loss on the sale was not material. (5) During 2022, the opioid litigation charges relate to agreements to resolve substantially all opioid claims against the Company by certain states and governmental entities. (6) During 2022, the gain on divestiture of subsidiaries represents the pre-tax gain on the sale of wholly-owned subsidiary bswift LLC (“bswift”), which the Company sold in November 2022, and the pre-tax gain on the sale of PayFlex Holdings, Inc. (“PayFlex”), which the Company sold in June 2022. 5 Adjusted Earnings Per Share (Unaudited) GAAP diluted Earnings Per Share (“EPS”) and Adjusted EPS, respectively, are calculated by dividing income from continuing operations attributable to CVS Health and adjusted income from continuing operations attributable to CVS Health by the Company’s weighted average diluted shares outstanding. The Company defines adjusted income from continuing operations attributable to CVS Health as income from continuing operations attributable to CVS Health (GAAP measure) excluding the impact of amortization of intangible assets, net realized capital gains or losses and other items, if any, that neither relate to the ordinary course of the Company’s business nor reflect the Company’s underlying business performance, such as acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, restructuring charges, office real estate optimization charges, losses on assets held for sale, opioid litigation charges, gains/losses on divestitures, as well as the corresponding tax benefit or expense related to the items excluded from adjusted income attributable to CVS Health and certain discrete tax items. The following are reconciliations of projected GAAP diluted EPS to projected Adjusted EPS : Year Ending December 31, 2024E 2023E 2022 At Least Low High Actual In millions, except per share amounts Per Common Share Net income attributable to CVS Health (GAAP measure) $ 7.26 $ 6.37 $ 6.61 $ 3.26 Non-GAAP adjustments: Amortization of intangible assets 1.58 1.48 1.47 1.35 Net realized capital (gains) losses — 0.27 0.27 0.24 Acquisition-related transaction and integration costs (1) 0.18 0.34 0.32 — Restructuring charges (2) — 0.39 0.39 — Office real estate optimization charges (3) — 0.06 0.05 0.09 Loss on assets held for sale (4) — 0.27 0.27 1.91 Opioid litigation charges (5) — — — 4.39 Gain on divestiture of subsidiaries (6) — — — (0.36) Tax impact of non-GAAP adjustments (7) (0.52) (0.68) (0.68) (1.85) Adjusted income attributable to CVS Health $ 8.50 $ 8.50 $ 8.70 $ 9.03 Weighted average diluted shares outstanding 1,263 1,291 1,291 1,323 (1) During 2024 and 2023, the acquisition-related transaction and integration costs relate to the acquisitions of Signify Health and Oak Street Health.

(6) During 2022, the gain on divestiture of subsidiaries represents the pre-tax gain on the sale of bswift, which the Company sold in November 2022, and the pre-tax gain on the sale of PayFlex, which the Company sold in June 2022. (7) Represents the corresponding tax benefit or expense related to the items excluded from Adjusted EPS above. The nature of each non-GAAP adjustment is evaluated to determine whether a discrete adjustment should be made to the adjusted income tax provision. During 2022, the Company’s adjusted income tax provision also excludes the impact of certain discrete tax items concluded in the first quarter of 2022. 7 "

LOWE’S COMPANIES, INC. Date: November 20, 2019 By: /s/ Matthew V. Hollifield Matthew V. Hollifield Senior Vice President, Chief Accounting Officer -;-EX-99.1:EX-99.1 2 exhibit991_11012019.htm PRESS RELEASE Exhibit Exhibit 99.1 November 20, 2019 For 6:00 am ET Release LOWE’S REPORTS THIRD QUARTER SALES AND EARNINGS RESULTS -- Diluted Earnings Per Share of $1.36 -- -- Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share 1 of $1.41-- -- Announces Restructuring of Canadian Operations -- -- Updates Fiscal 2019 Business Outlook to Raise Adjusted Operating Margin 1 and Adjusted EPS 1 Ranges -- MOORESVILLE, N.C . – Lowe’s Companies, Inc. (NYSE: LOW) today reported net earnings of $1.0 billion and diluted earnings per share of $1.36 for the quarter ended Nov. 1, 2019, which included non-cash pre-tax charges of $53 million further described below, compared to net earnings of $629 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.78 in the third quarter of 2018. Excluding the impact of these charges, adjusted diluted earnings per share 1 increased 35.6 percent to $1.41 from adjusted diluted earnings per share 1 of $1.04 in the third quarter of 2018. The $53 million non-cash pre-tax charges referenced above resulted from the company initiating a strategic review of its Canadian operations during the third quarter. This review led to long-lived asset impairments and a change to the Canadian leadership team in the third quarter. Based on the findings of the strategic review, in the fourth quarter, the company decided to take the following actions to improve future sales performance and profitability: • Close 34 underperforming stores in Canada; • Undertake a process to simplify multiple Canadian store banners to drive efficiency and reduce operational complexity; • Reorganize the corporate support structure across Canada to more efficiently serve stores; and • Rationalize the product assortment across the simplified Canadian store banners, to present a more coordinated assortment to the customer. Additional pre-tax operating costs and charges of $175 to $225 million consisting of inventory liquidation, accelerated depreciation and amortization, severance and other costs are expected to be incurred in the fourth quarter of 2019, and have been reflected in the Company’s updated GAAP business outlook. Sales for the third quarter were $17.4 billion and consolidated comparable sales increased 2.2 percent. Comparable sales for the U.S. home improvement business increased 3.0 percent. “We were pleased with the performance of our U.S. home improvement stores, which reflects a solid macroeconomic backdrop and continued progress in our transformation driven by investments in customer experience, improved merchandise category performance, and continued growth of our Pro business. Due to improved execution, we delivered strong earnings per share growth, and as a result, we are raising our adjusted earnings per share and adjusted operating income guidance for 2019,” commented Marvin R. Ellison, Lowe’s president and CEO. “Although we still have work to do, I am confident we are on the right path to build a better Lowe’s and generate long-term profitable growth. We are committed to the Canadian market and are taking decisive action to improve the performance and profitability of our Canadian operations. We also have a detailed roadmap and a very experienced team in place to repair our Lowes.com business. As we enter the fourth quarter, we are building strong momentum in the U.S. and are well positioned to deliver strong topline performance, while also driving margin improvement and operational efficiency. We are excited about the progress we’ve made and the opportunity that lies ahead. I would like to thank our associates for their commitment and dedication to serving our customers and communities,” added Ellison. 1 Adjusted operating margin and adjusted diluted earnings per share are non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures Reconciliation” section of this release for additional information as well as a reconciliation between the Company’s GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. Delivering on its commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, the Company repurchased $835 million of stock under its share repurchase program and paid $428 million in dividends in the third quarter. As of Nov. 1, 2019, Lowe’s operated 2,004 home improvement and hardware stores in the United States and Canada representing 208.9 million square feet of retail selling space. A conference call to discuss third quarter 2019 operating results is scheduled for today (Wednesday, Nov. 20) at 9:00 am ET. The conference call will be available by webcast and can be accessed by visiting Lowe’s website at www.Lowes.com/investor and clicking on Lowe’s Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call Webcast. Supplemental materials will be available approximately 15 minutes prior to the start of the conference call. A replay of the call will be archived on Lowes.com/investor until Feb. 25, 2020. Lowe’s Business Outlook The Company has updated its GAAP business outlook to reflect pre-tax operating costs and charges associated with its Canadian restructuring, as well as its expectations for fourth quarter operating results. The Company has raised its 2019 adjusted operating margin 1 and adjusted diluted earnings per share 1 outlook, reflecting its expectations for fourth quarter operating results. Fiscal Year 2019 (comparisons to fiscal year 2018) • Total sales are expected to increase approximately 2 percent. • Comparable sales are expected to increase approximately 3 percent. • Operating income as a percentage of sales (operating margin) is expected to increase 290 to 320 basis points. • Adjusted operating income as a percentage of sales (adjusted operating margin 1 ) is expected to increase 40 to 60 basis points. • The effective income tax rate and adjusted effective income tax rate are expected to be approximately 24%. • The target leverage ratio is 2.75x, therefore the Company expects to repurchase approximately $4 billion of stock. • Diluted earnings per share of $5.35 to $5.47 are expected for the fiscal year ending Jan. 31, 2020. • Adjusted diluted earnings per share 1 of $5.63 to $5.70 are expected for the fiscal year ending Jan. 31, 2020.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures Reconciliation (Unaudited) To provide additional transparency, the Company has presented the non-GAAP financial measure of adjusted earnings per share to exclude the impact of certain discrete items, as further described below, not contemplated in Lowe’s original Business Outlook for 2019 to assist the user in understanding performance relative to that Business Outlook. In addition, in the Business Outlook for fiscal 2019, the Company has provided a comparison to the non-GAAP financial measure of adjusted operating margin for fiscal 2018, which excludes the impact of certain discrete items, as further described below, not contemplated in Lowe's original Business Outlook for 2018, to assist the user in further understanding the Company's forecasted performance for fiscal 2019 in comparison to fiscal 2018. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful insight for analysts and investors in evaluating the company’s operational performance. Fiscal 2019 Impacts For fiscal 2019, the Company has recognized, or expects to recognize, financial impacts from the following discrete items, not contemplated in the Company’s original Business Outlook for 2019: • Prior to the beginning of fiscal 2019, the Company announced its intention to exit its Mexico retail operations and had planned to sell the operating business. However, in the first quarter of 2019, after an extensive market evaluation, the decision was made to instead sell the assets of the business. That decision resulted in a tax benefit in the first quarter. During the first six months of fiscal 2019, the Company recognized pre-tax operating losses associated with the exit and ongoing wind-down of Mexico retail operations of $27 million, which were offset by $83 million of tax benefit. For the third quarter, pre-tax operating losses for the Mexico retail operations were insignificant (Mexico adjustments). • During the third quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company began a strategic review of its Canadian operations, and as a result, recognized pre-tax charges of $53 million associated with long-lived asset impairment. In addition, the Company announced on November 20, 2019, additional actions to improve future performance and profitability of its Canadian operations. As a result of these actions, in the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company expects additional pre-tax operating costs and charges of $175 to $225 million consisting of inventory liquidation, accelerated depreciation and amortization, severance, and other costs, as well as associated potential impacts to the Company’s income tax expense (2019 Canada restructuring). Fiscal 2018 Impacts During fiscal 2018, the Company recognized financial impacts from the following discrete items, not contemplated in the Company's original Business Outlook for 2018: • During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company recorded $952 million of goodwill impairment associated with its Canadian operations (Canadian goodwill impairment); • On August 17, 2018, the Company committed to exit its Orchard Supply Hardware operations. As a result, the Company recognized pre-tax charges of $230 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2018 associated with long-lived asset impairments and discontinued projects. During the third quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company recognized pre-tax charges of $123 million associated with accelerated depreciation and amortization, severance and lease obligations. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company recognized additional pre-tax charges of $208 million primarily related to lease obligations. Total pre-tax charges for fiscal year 2018 were $561 million (Orchard Supply Hardware charges); • On October 31, 2018, the Company committed to close 20 under-performing stores across the U.S. and 31 locations in Canada, including 27 under-performing stores. As a result, the Company recognized pre-tax charges of $121 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2018 associated with long-lived asset impairment and severance obligations. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, the company recognized additional pre-tax charges of $150 million, primarily associated with severance and lease obligation costs, as well as accelerated depreciation. Total pre-tax charges for fiscal year 2018 were $271 million (U.S. and Canada store closure charges); • On November 20, 2018, the Company announced its plans to exit retail operations in Mexico and is exploring strategic alternatives. During the third quarter, $22 million of long-lived asset impairment was recognized on certain assets in Mexico as a result of the strategic evaluation. During the fourth quarter, an additional $222 million of impairment was recognized. Total charges for fiscal year 2018 were $244 million (Mexico impairment charges); • During the third quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company identified certain non-core activities within its U.S. home improvement business to exit, including Alacrity Renovation Services and Iris Smart Home. As a result, during the third quarter of 2018, the company recognized pre-tax charges of $14 million associated with long-lived asset impairment and inventory write-down. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company recognized additional pre-tax charges of $32 million. Total pre-tax charges for fiscal year 2018 were $46 million (Non-core activities charges), and; • During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company recorded pre-tax charges of $13 million, associated with severance costs due to the elimination of the Project Specialists Interiors position (Project Specialists Interiors charge). Adjusted diluted earnings per share and adjusted operating margin should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful indicator of, the company’s diluted earnings per share or operating margin as prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s methods of determining these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the method used by other companies for this or similar non-GAAP financial measures. Accordingly, these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to the measures used by other companies.

(the Company) uses certain non-GAAP financial measures and considers them to be important supplemental measures of the Company's performance, as further outlined below. Management also believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide additional insight for analysts and investors in evaluating the Company's financial and operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered alternatives to, or more meaningful indicators of, the Company's financial measures as prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company's methods of determining these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the methods used by other companies for these or similar non-GAAP financial measures. Accordingly, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to measures used by other companies. During fiscal year 2018, the Company initiated an ongoing strategic reassessment of its business to drive increased focus on its core home improvement operations. As a result of this reassessment, the Company decided to exit certain activities and close certain locations as further described below. Therefore, as part of its Business Outlook for 2019, the Company has presented a comparison of key financial measures which exclude the impacts of these discrete items, as further detailed below, to assist the user in understanding the Company's Business Outlook for fiscal 2019 in comparison to fiscal 2018, as well as its business performance.

Hollifield Senior Vice President, Chief Accounting Officer ","EX-99.1:EX-99.1 2 exhibit991_11012019.htm PRESS RELEASE Exhibit Exhibit 99.1 November 20, 2019 For 6:00 am ET Release LOWE’S REPORTS THIRD QUARTER SALES AND EARNINGS RESULTS -- Diluted Earnings Per Share of $1.36 -- -- Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share 1 of $1.41-- -- Announces Restructuring of Canadian Operations -- -- Updates Fiscal 2019 Business Outlook to Raise Adjusted Operating Margin 1 and Adjusted EPS 1 Ranges -- MOORESVILLE, N.C . – Lowe’s Companies, Inc. (NYSE: LOW) today reported net earnings of $1.0 billion and diluted earnings per share of $1.36 for the quarter ended Nov. 1, 2019, which included non-cash pre-tax charges of $53 million further described below, compared to net earnings of $629 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.78 in the third quarter of 2018. Excluding the impact of these charges, adjusted diluted earnings per share 1 increased 35.6 percent to $1.41 from adjusted diluted earnings per share 1 of $1.04 in the third quarter of 2018. The $53 million non-cash pre-tax charges referenced above resulted from the company initiating a strategic review of its Canadian operations during the third quarter. This review led to long-lived asset impairments and a change to the Canadian leadership team in the third quarter. Based on the findings of the strategic review, in the fourth quarter, the company decided to take the following actions to improve future sales performance and profitability: • Close 34 underperforming stores in Canada; • Undertake a process to simplify multiple Canadian store banners to drive efficiency and reduce operational complexity; • Reorganize the corporate support structure across Canada to more efficiently serve stores; and • Rationalize the product assortment across the simplified Canadian store banners, to present a more coordinated assortment to the customer. Additional pre-tax operating costs and charges of $175 to $225 million consisting of inventory liquidation, accelerated depreciation and amortization, severance and other costs are expected to be incurred in the fourth quarter of 2019, and have been reflected in the Company’s updated GAAP business outlook. Sales for the third quarter were $17.4 billion and consolidated comparable sales increased 2.2 percent. Comparable sales for the U.S. home improvement business increased 3.0 percent. “We were pleased with the performance of our U.S. home improvement stores, which reflects a solid macroeconomic backdrop and continued progress in our transformation driven by investments in customer experience, improved merchandise category performance, and continued growth of our Pro business. Due to improved execution, we delivered strong earnings per share growth, and as a result, we are raising our adjusted earnings per share and adjusted operating income guidance for 2019,” commented Marvin R. Ellison, Lowe’s president and CEO. “Although we still have work to do, I am confident we are on the right path to build a better Lowe’s and generate long-term profitable growth. We are committed to the Canadian market and are taking decisive action to improve the performance and profitability of our Canadian operations. We also have a detailed roadmap and a very experienced team in place to repair our Lowes.com business. As we enter the fourth quarter, we are building strong momentum in the U.S. and are well positioned to deliver strong topline performance, while also driving margin improvement and operational efficiency. We are excited about the progress we’ve made and the opportunity that lies ahead. I would like to thank our associates for their commitment and dedication to serving our customers and communities,” added Ellison. 1 Adjusted operating margin and adjusted diluted earnings per share are non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures Reconciliation” section of this release for additional information as well as a reconciliation between the Company’s GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. Delivering on its commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, the Company repurchased $835 million of stock under its share repurchase program and paid $428 million in dividends in the third quarter. As of Nov. 1, 2019, Lowe’s operated 2,004 home improvement and hardware stores in the United States and Canada representing 208.9 million square feet of retail selling space.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures Reconciliation (Unaudited) To provide additional transparency, the Company has presented the non-GAAP financial measure of adjusted earnings per share to exclude the impact of certain discrete items, as further described below, not contemplated in Lowe’s original Business Outlook for 2019 to assist the user in understanding performance relative to that Business Outlook. In addition, in the Business Outlook for fiscal 2019, the Company has provided a comparison to the non-GAAP financial measure of adjusted operating margin for fiscal 2018, which excludes the impact of certain discrete items, as further described below, not contemplated in Lowe's original Business Outlook for 2018, to assist the user in further understanding the Company's forecasted performance for fiscal 2019 in comparison to fiscal 2018. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful insight for analysts and investors in evaluating the company’s operational performance. Fiscal 2019 Impacts For fiscal 2019, the Company has recognized, or expects to recognize, financial impacts from the following discrete items, not contemplated in the Company’s original Business Outlook for 2019: • Prior to the beginning of fiscal 2019, the Company announced its intention to exit its Mexico retail operations and had planned to sell the operating business. However, in the first quarter of 2019, after an extensive market evaluation, the decision was made to instead sell the assets of the business. That decision resulted in a tax benefit in the first quarter. During the first six months of fiscal 2019, the Company recognized pre-tax operating losses associated with the exit and ongoing wind-down of Mexico retail operations of $27 million, which were offset by $83 million of tax benefit. For the third quarter, pre-tax operating losses for the Mexico retail operations were insignificant (Mexico adjustments). • During the third quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company began a strategic review of its Canadian operations, and as a result, recognized pre-tax charges of $53 million associated with long-lived asset impairment. In addition, the Company announced on November 20, 2019, additional actions to improve future performance and profitability of its Canadian operations. As a result of these actions, in the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company expects additional pre-tax operating costs and charges of $175 to $225 million consisting of inventory liquidation, accelerated depreciation and amortization, severance, and other costs, as well as associated potential impacts to the Company’s income tax expense (2019 Canada restructuring). Fiscal 2018 Impacts During fiscal 2018, the Company recognized financial impacts from the following discrete items, not contemplated in the Company's original Business Outlook for 2018: • During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company recorded $952 million of goodwill impairment associated with its Canadian operations (Canadian goodwill impairment); • On August 17, 2018, the Company committed to exit its Orchard Supply Hardware operations. As a result, the Company recognized pre-tax charges of $230 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2018 associated with long-lived asset impairments and discontinued projects. During the third quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company recognized pre-tax charges of $123 million associated with accelerated depreciation and amortization, severance and lease obligations. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company recognized additional pre-tax charges of $208 million primarily related to lease obligations. Total pre-tax charges for fiscal year 2018 were $561 million (Orchard Supply Hardware charges); • On October 31, 2018, the Company committed to close 20 under-performing stores across the U.S. and 31 locations in Canada, including 27 under-performing stores. As a result, the Company recognized pre-tax charges of $121 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2018 associated with long-lived asset impairment and severance obligations. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, the company recognized additional pre-tax charges of $150 million, primarily associated with severance and lease obligation costs, as well as accelerated depreciation. Total pre-tax charges for fiscal year 2018 were $271 million (U.S. and Canada store closure charges); • On November 20, 2018, the Company announced its plans to exit retail operations in Mexico and is exploring strategic alternatives. During the third quarter, $22 million of long-lived asset impairment was recognized on certain assets in Mexico as a result of the strategic evaluation. During the fourth quarter, an additional $222 million of impairment was recognized. Total charges for fiscal year 2018 were $244 million (Mexico impairment charges); • During the third quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company identified certain non-core activities within its U.S. home improvement business to exit, including Alacrity Renovation Services and Iris Smart Home. As a result, during the third quarter of 2018, the company recognized pre-tax charges of $14 million associated with long-lived asset impairment and inventory write-down. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company recognized additional pre-tax charges of $32 million. Total pre-tax charges for fiscal year 2018 were $46 million (Non-core activities charges), and; • During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company recorded pre-tax charges of $13 million, associated with severance costs due to the elimination of the Project Specialists Interiors position (Project Specialists Interiors charge). Adjusted diluted earnings per share and adjusted operating margin should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful indicator of, the company’s diluted earnings per share or operating margin as prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s methods of determining these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the method used by other companies for this or similar non-GAAP financial measures. Accordingly, these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to the measures used by other companies. Detailed reconciliations between the Company’s GAAP and non-GAAP financial results are shown below and available on the Company’s website at www.lowes.com/investor.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures Reconciliation (Unaudited) To provide additional transparency, the company has presented the non-GAAP financial measure of adjusted earnings per share to exclude the impact of certain discrete items, as further described below, not contemplated in Lowe’s original Business Outlook for 2019 to assist the user in understanding performance relative to that Business Outlook. In addition, as part of its Business Outlook for 2019, the company has provided a comparison to the non-GAAP financial measure of adjusted operating margin for fiscal 2018, which excludes the impact of certain discrete items, as further described below, not contemplated in Lowe's original Business Outlook for 2018, to assist the user in further understanding the company's Business Outlook for fiscal 2019 in comparison to fiscal 2018. The company believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful insight for analysts and investors in evaluating the company’s operational performance. The company previously announced its intention to exit its Mexico retail operations and had planned to sell the operating business. However, in the first quarter of 2019, after an extensive market evaluation, the decision was made to instead sell the assets of the business. During the second quarter, the Company recognized $14 million of pre-tax operating costs for the ongoing wind-down of the Mexico retail operations which were offset by $3 million tax benefit (Mexico adjustments). During fiscal 2018, the company recognized the following pre-tax charges, not contemplated in the company's original Business Outlook for 2018: • During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, the company recorded $952 million of goodwill impairment associated with its Canadian operations (Canadian goodwill impairment); • On August 17, 2018, the company committed to exit its Orchard Supply Hardware operations. As a result, the company recognized pre-tax charges of $230 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2018 associated with long-lived asset impairments and discontinued projects. During the third quarter of fiscal 2018, the company recognized pre-tax charges of $123 million associated with accelerated depreciation and amortization, severance and lease obligations. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, the company recognized additional pre-tax charges of $208 million primarily related to lease obligations. Total pre-tax charges for fiscal year 2018 were $561 million (Orchard Supply Hardware charges); • On October 31, 2018, the company committed to close 20 under-performing stores across the U.S. and 31 locations in Canada, including 27 under-performing stores. As a result, the company recognized pre-tax charges of $121 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2018 associated with long-lived asset impairment and severance obligations. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, the company recognized additional pre-tax charges of $150 million, primarily associated with severance and lease obligation costs, as well as accelerated depreciation. Total pre-tax charges for fiscal year 2018 were $271 million (U.S. and Canada store closure charges); • On November 20, 2018, the company announced its plans to exit retail operations in Mexico and is exploring strategic alternatives. During the third quarter, $22 million of long-lived asset impairment was recognized on certain assets in Mexico as a result of the strategic evaluation. During the fourth quarter, an additional $222 million of impairment was recognized. Total charges for fiscal year 2018 were $244 million (Mexico impairment charges); • During the third quarter of fiscal 2018, the company identified certain non-core activities within its U.S. home improvement business to exit, including Alacrity Renovation Services and Iris Smart Home. As a result, during the third quarter of 2018, the company recognized pre-tax charges of $14 million associated with long-lived asset impairment and inventory write-down. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, the company recognized additional pre-tax charges of $32 million. Total pre-tax charges for fiscal year 2018 were $46 million (Non-core activities charges), and; • During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, the company recorded pre-tax charges of $13 million, associated with severance costs due to the elimination of the Project Specialists Interiors position (Project Specialists Interiors charge). Adjusted diluted earnings per share and adjusted operating margin should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful indicator of, the company’s diluted earnings per share or operating margin as prepared in accordance with GAAP. The company’s methods of determining these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the method used by other companies for this or similar non-GAAP financial measures. Accordingly, these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to the measures used by other companies.

With respect to acquisitions and dispositions, potential risks include the effect of such transactions on Lowe’s and the target company’s or operating business’s strategic relationships, operating results and businesses generally; our ability to integrate or divest personnel, labor models, financial, IT and other systems successfully; disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management; hiring additional management and other critical personnel; increasing or decreasing the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations; significant integration or disposition costs or unknown liabilities; and failure to realize the expected benefits of the transaction.

Comparable sales for the U.S. home improvement business increased 3.2 percent. “We capitalized on spring demand, strong holiday event execution and growth in Paint and our Pro business to deliver strong second quarter results. Despite lumber deflation and difficult weather, we are pleased that we delivered positive comparable sales in all 15 geographic regions of the U.S. This is a reflection of a solid macroeconomic backdrop and continued momentum executing our retail fundamentals framework,” commented Marvin R. Ellison, Lowe’s president and CEO. “Our transformation is ongoing, and our future is bright. We are confident that we are on the right path to capitalize on solid demand in a healthy home improvement market and generate long-term profitable growth. I would like to thank our associates for their hard work and continued commitment to serving customers,” added Ellison.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures Reconciliation (Unaudited) To provide additional transparency, the company has presented the non-GAAP financial measure of adjusted earnings per share to exclude the impact of certain discrete items, as further described below, not contemplated in Lowe’s original Business Outlook for 2019 to assist the user in understanding performance relative to that Business Outlook. In addition, as part of its Business Outlook for 2019, the company has provided a comparison to the non-GAAP financial measure of adjusted operating margin for fiscal 2018, which excludes the impact of certain discrete items, as further described below, not contemplated in Lowe's original Business Outlook for 2018, to assist the user in further understanding the company's Business Outlook for fiscal 2019 in comparison to fiscal 2018. The company believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful insight for analysts and investors in evaluating the company’s operational performance. The company previously announced its intention to exit its Mexico retail operations and had planned to sell the operating business. However, in the first quarter of 2019, after an extensive market evaluation, the decision was made to instead sell the assets of the business. During the second quarter, the Company recognized $14 million of pre-tax operating costs for the ongoing wind-down of the Mexico retail operations which were offset by $3 million tax benefit (Mexico adjustments). During fiscal 2018, the company recognized the following pre-tax charges, not contemplated in the company's original Business Outlook for 2018: • During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, the company recorded $952 million of goodwill impairment associated with its Canadian operations (Canadian goodwill impairment); • On August 17, 2018, the company committed to exit its Orchard Supply Hardware operations. As a result, the company recognized pre-tax charges of $230 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2018 associated with long-lived asset impairments and discontinued projects. During the third quarter of fiscal 2018, the company recognized pre-tax charges of $123 million associated with accelerated depreciation and amortization, severance and lease obligations. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, the company recognized additional pre-tax charges of $208 million primarily related to lease obligations. Total pre-tax charges for fiscal year 2018 were $561 million (Orchard Supply Hardware charges); • On October 31, 2018, the company committed to close 20 under-performing stores across the U.S. and 31 locations in Canada, including 27 under-performing stores. As a result, the company recognized pre-tax charges of $121 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2018 associated with long-lived asset impairment and severance obligations. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, the company recognized additional pre-tax charges of $150 million, primarily associated with severance and lease obligation costs, as well as accelerated depreciation. Total pre-tax charges for fiscal year 2018 were $271 million (U.S. and Canada store closure charges); • On November 20, 2018, the company announced its plans to exit retail operations in Mexico and is exploring strategic alternatives. During the third quarter, $22 million of long-lived asset impairment was recognized on certain assets in Mexico as a result of the strategic evaluation. During the fourth quarter, an additional $222 million of impairment was recognized. Total charges for fiscal year 2018 were $244 million (Mexico impairment charges); • During the third quarter of fiscal 2018, the company identified certain non-core activities within its U.S. home improvement business to exit, including Alacrity Renovation Services and Iris Smart Home.
