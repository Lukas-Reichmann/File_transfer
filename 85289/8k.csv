(NASDAQ:INOD) today reported results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2023. * Adjusted EBITDA is defined below. The amounts in this press release have been rounded. All percentages have been calculated using unrounded amounts. Jack Abuhoff, CEO, said, “Today we are pleased to announce third quarter revenue of $22.2 million, representing 20% year-over-year growth. It is worth noting that year-over-year growth was 27% if we back out revenue from the large social media company which contributed $1 million in revenue in the prior quarter but dramatically cut spending after a significant and highly-publicized management change. “We are also very pleased to announce third quarter Adjusted EBITDA of $3.2 million, representing 100% sequential quarter-on-quarter growth. The $1.6 million of sequential Adjusted EBITDA growth, viewed together with the $2.5 million of sequential quarter-on-quarter revenue growth, demonstrates strong operating leverage as well as successful cost management. Looked at year over year, we see the same thing: we returned $4.4 million of Adjusted EBITDA growth on $3.7 million of revenue growth. “Third quarter growth was driven by the start of ramp up for generative AI development work with one of the new big tech customers we announced this summer. We expect our work with this customer to continue ramping up in the fourth quarter and into the first quarter, potentially reaching a $23 to $25 million runrate at the end of the year with which to start next year. At the very end of the third quarter, we also kicked off our generative AI development program with the other new big tech customer we announced this summer, and we expect it will also contribute to fourth quarter revenue. In fact, we anticipate continuing to expand revenue with both of these new customers through Q4 and in 2024. “For the fourth quarter, we are forecasting revenue of $24.5 million or more, representing 26% or higher year-over-year growth. Again, if we back out revenue from the large social media company which contributed $0.5 million in revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022, our fourth quarter forecast would represent 30% or better year-over-year growth. Since there was no revenue from this social media customer in Q1 2023, beginning in Q1 2024 revenue from this social media customer will no longer provide a drag on year-over-year comparisons. “For the fourth quarter, we’re forecasting Adjusted EBITDA of $3.7 million or more, which would be approximately 15 or more times Adjusted EBITDA from fourth quarter last year.” Abuhoff continued, “I am also very pleased to announce that in September we signed a master services agreement for AI development with yet another of the world’s largest tech companies – a company whose AI programs we have been trying to break into for a year now. Based on our research, this large tech company is likely to spend several hundred million dollars on generative AI data engineering services in 2024, so this win, like others we announced this summer, packs a lot of potential. While this relationship is at an early stage, we see huge potential in it. “As we look ahead and plan for 2024, we foresee an exciting and transformative year ahead. We believe we have the strategy, business momentum and customer relationships to deliver significant revenue growth and Adjusted EBITDA growth. We currently intend to provide guidance for 2024 revenue and Adjusted EBITDA growth when we release our fourth quarter results. “Our strategy for growth is two-fold. First, we will support large technology companies building generative AI foundation models. Second, we will support enterprises across a wide range of verticals that seek to integrate and fine-tune generative AI models. “We now have master service agreements in place with five of the largest technology companies in the world under which we are providing generative AI program support. Landing these agreements was non-trivial. Our success at having done so, I believe, testifies to the strength of our value proposition and our capabilities. With these agreements now in hand, we believe we are poised to deliver significant growth in 2024. “Over the next several years, we believe that these technology companies will be building bigger and better generative AI models. Indeed, when you listen to the large-tech companies’ earnings calls this quarter what emerges is an overwhelming sense that generative AI is their number-one strategic priority; that it’s their biggest investment area for 2024; and that they believe generative AI is a fundamental platform shift that is just at its very beginning. One of these companies specifically stated that it believes it will drive tens of billions of dollars of revenue over the next several years from generative AI innovation. “The product-centric large-tech companies are talking about creating generative AI-powered experiences across their product lines, transforming the way people use their products. The infrastructure-centric large-tech companies are talking about deploying new and differentiating generative AI services and bolstering their AI infrastructure to serve their customers’ AI training and inferencing needs. And both product-centric and infrastructure-centric large-tech companies are talking about increasing capital investment into generative AI as a result of the strong demand that they see. This, we believe, bodes very well for us. “During the summer, we announced winning two new “Big Five” tech customers and both a program expansion and a new program with an existing “Big Five” tech customer, all to help develop and train large language models. “We announced the first new “Big Five” customer win on July 18, and on August 29 we announced that the program had been expanded. Our program began ramping up in early August. We anticipate that we will continue to ramp the program through Q4 and into Q1, reaching a revenue runrate on just this one customer of potentially $23 to $25 million by the end of the year with which to start next year. We are now in discussions with this customer about potential further program expansions and potential additional programs. “We announced our second new “Big Five” customer win on August 10, and on August 22 we announced that our agreement got signed. While in our announcements we stated that rampup would begin early in the fourth quarter, I’m pleased to report that we were able to kick things off at the tail end of the third quarter. While we had a bit of revenue from this customer in the third quarter, we anticipate that revenue from this customer will impact our fourth quarter results more significantly. We are now in discussions with this customer about scope of the initial program – which has the potential to be quite large – as well as other programs. The customer has authorized $2.5 million in spend to get us started, has promised that an additional $1.5 million authorization will arrive soon, and has stated that it intends to supplement these authorizations as we move forward with program expansion. “On June 27, we announced that an existing Big Five customer had selected us to perform AI data annotation and LLM fine-tuning as a while-labeled service for its cloud and platform customers, and on June 14, we announced that this same customer had engaged us for its LLM build program. In this latter announcement, we stated that we anticipated potentially exceeding $8 million in revenue from this customer in 2023, up from approximately $3 million last year. We believe that we are on track to meet or exceed this target. Included in this year’s forecast is approximately $330 thousand of revenue from the white label program, consisting of six won or late-stage opportunities. We believe this white label program will contribute more significantly to 2024. For 2024, we already have several million in pipeline opportunities, including two opportunities that we value at $2 million and $1 million, respectively. It is worth noting that we believe the $2 million opportunity could potentially open an exciting new market for us. We are hoping to close both of these opportunities in Q1. Under the white label program, we are seeing a mix of requirements from our customer’s enterprise customers. Requirements range from generative AI data pipelines to two- and three-dimensional data annotation; chatbot fine-tuning; LLM-based search and retrieval; and training LLMs for multi-lingual, domain-specific summarization and conversation. Importantly, the program is enabling us to potentially scale an enterprise offering independent of our own sales and marketing; to leverage both our customer’s brand and its significant customer reach; and to gain exposure to a wide range of early-adopter generative AI use cases. “We believe this exposure will set us up well for what we believe will potentially be our largest and most significant opportunity – LLMs for the enterprise. These are still early days in terms of enterprise adoption of generative AI, but we believe that a decade from now, virtually all successful businesses will have adopted generative AI technologies into their products and operations. To do so, they will require one or more of the capabilities that we offer. Enterprise data sciences teams will require support to train and fine-tune open source and proprietary LLMs and to conduct specialized testing and evaluations to ensure that the LLMs are helpful, honest, and harmless. They will also require support to implement retrieval augmented generation, or RAG for short, a technique for harnessing enterprise data assets within LLM prompts. Meanwhile, enterprise line-of-business managers will require support to build customized generative AI models and applications. Additionally, these line-of-business managers will require support to deliver the kind of business process and workflow transformation that will be possible with generative AI. And when we identify opportunities to deliver AI-enabled transformation via a subscription-based platform, as we have now with PR workflows, underwriting workflows, and compliance workflows, we will enable them to subscribe to our platforms rather than having to undertake complex and expensive builds themselves. “In the third quarter, we closed three important enterprise generative AI opportunities with large companies. Their scope ranges from strategy to implementation. In one of the engagements, we will be helping a leading information company create a strategic roadmap for AI/LLM integration for its products and internal operations and will be building LLM proofs-of-concept. In another, we will be helping fine-tune LLMs for three customer use cases pertaining to legal services. In the third deal, we will be creating datasets to train an LLM to support doctor/patient interactions.” Abuhoff concluded, “We ended Q3 with $14.8 million in cash and short-term investments, up from $13.7 million last quarter. We continue to have no appreciable debt. To support our growth and future working capital requirements, we have a revolving line of credit with Wells Fargo that provides up to $10 million of financing subject to a borrowing base limitation.” Timing of Conference Call with Q&A Innodata will conduct an earnings conference call, including a question-and-answer period, at 5:00 PM eastern time today.

Mnovero@innodata.com (201) 371-8015 Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to the financial information prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP (“GAAP”), we provide certain non-GAAP financial information. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures assist investors in making comparisons of period-to-period operating results. In some respects, management believes non-GAAP financial measures are more indicative of our ongoing core operating performance than their GAAP equivalents by making adjustments that management believes are reflective of the ongoing performance of the business. We believe that the presentation of this non-GAAP financial information provides investors with greater transparency by providing investors a more complete understanding of our financial performance, competitive position, and prospects for the future, particularly by providing the same information that management and our Board of Directors use to evaluate our performance and manage the business. However, the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this press release have certain limitations in that they do not reflect all of the costs associated with the operations of our business as determined in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, investors should consider non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or as superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Further, the non-GAAP financial measures that we present may differ from similar non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) attributable to Innodata Inc. and its subsidiaries in accordance with U.S. GAAP before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization of intangible assets (which derives EBITDA), plus additional adjustments for loss on impairment of intangible assets and goodwill, stock-based compensation, income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, non-recurring severance, and other one-time costs. We use Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate core results of operations and trends between fiscal periods and believe that these measures are important components of our internal performance measurement process. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is included in the tables that accompany this release. INNODATA INC.

","EX-99.1:Exhibit 99.1 Innodata Reports Third Quarter 2023 Results and Signing New Big Tech for Generative AI Development Revenue Up 20% Year-Over-Year; Accelerating Growth in Q4 and 2024 Anticipated NEW YORK – November 2, 2023 – INNODATA INC. (NASDAQ:INOD) today reported results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2023. * Adjusted EBITDA is defined below. The amounts in this press release have been rounded. All percentages have been calculated using unrounded amounts. Jack Abuhoff, CEO, said, “Today we are pleased to announce third quarter revenue of $22.2 million, representing 20% year-over-year growth. It is worth noting that year-over-year growth was 27% if we back out revenue from the large social media company which contributed $1 million in revenue in the prior quarter but dramatically cut spending after a significant and highly-publicized management change. “We are also very pleased to announce third quarter Adjusted EBITDA of $3.2 million, representing 100% sequential quarter-on-quarter growth. The $1.6 million of sequential Adjusted EBITDA growth, viewed together with the $2.5 million of sequential quarter-on-quarter revenue growth, demonstrates strong operating leverage as well as successful cost management. Looked at year over year, we see the same thing: we returned $4.4 million of Adjusted EBITDA growth on $3.7 million of revenue growth. “Third quarter growth was driven by the start of ramp up for generative AI development work with one of the new big tech customers we announced this summer. We expect our work with this customer to continue ramping up in the fourth quarter and into the first quarter, potentially reaching a $23 to $25 million runrate at the end of the year with which to start next year. At the very end of the third quarter, we also kicked off our generative AI development program with the other new big tech customer we announced this summer, and we expect it will also contribute to fourth quarter revenue. In fact, we anticipate continuing to expand revenue with both of these new customers through Q4 and in 2024. “For the fourth quarter, we are forecasting revenue of $24.5 million or more, representing 26% or higher year-over-year growth. Again, if we back out revenue from the large social media company which contributed $0.5 million in revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022, our fourth quarter forecast would represent 30% or better year-over-year growth. Since there was no revenue from this social media customer in Q1 2023, beginning in Q1 2024 revenue from this social media customer will no longer provide a drag on year-over-year comparisons. “For the fourth quarter, we’re forecasting Adjusted EBITDA of $3.7 million or more, which would be approximately 15 or more times Adjusted EBITDA from fourth quarter last year.” Abuhoff continued, “I am also very pleased to announce that in September we signed a master services agreement for AI development with yet another of the world’s largest tech companies – a company whose AI programs we have been trying to break into for a year now. Based on our research, this large tech company is likely to spend several hundred million dollars on generative AI data engineering services in 2024, so this win, like others we announced this summer, packs a lot of potential. While this relationship is at an early stage, we see huge potential in it. “As we look ahead and plan for 2024, we foresee an exciting and transformative year ahead. We believe we have the strategy, business momentum and customer relationships to deliver significant revenue growth and Adjusted EBITDA growth. We currently intend to provide guidance for 2024 revenue and Adjusted EBITDA growth when we release our fourth quarter results. “Our strategy for growth is two-fold. First, we will support large technology companies building generative AI foundation models. Second, we will support enterprises across a wide range of verticals that seek to integrate and fine-tune generative AI models. “We now have master service agreements in place with five of the largest technology companies in the world under which we are providing generative AI program support. Landing these agreements was non-trivial. Our success at having done so, I believe, testifies to the strength of our value proposition and our capabilities. With these agreements now in hand, we believe we are poised to deliver significant growth in 2024. “Over the next several years, we believe that these technology companies will be building bigger and better generative AI models. Indeed, when you listen to the large-tech companies’ earnings calls this quarter what emerges is an overwhelming sense that generative AI is their number-one strategic priority; that it’s their biggest investment area for 2024; and that they believe generative AI is a fundamental platform shift that is just at its very beginning. One of these companies specifically stated that it believes it will drive tens of billions of dollars of revenue over the next several years from generative AI innovation. “The product-centric large-tech companies are talking about creating generative AI-powered experiences across their product lines, transforming the way people use their products. The infrastructure-centric large-tech companies are talking about deploying new and differentiating generative AI services and bolstering their AI infrastructure to serve their customers’ AI training and inferencing needs. And both product-centric and infrastructure-centric large-tech companies are talking about increasing capital investment into generative AI as a result of the strong demand that they see. This, we believe, bodes very well for us. “During the summer, we announced winning two new “Big Five” tech customers and both a program expansion and a new program with an existing “Big Five” tech customer, all to help develop and train large language models. “We announced the first new “Big Five” customer win on July 18, and on August 29 we announced that the program had been expanded. Our program began ramping up in early August. We anticipate that we will continue to ramp the program through Q4 and into Q1, reaching a revenue runrate on just this one customer of potentially $23 to $25 million by the end of the year with which to start next year. We are now in discussions with this customer about potential further program expansions and potential additional programs. “We announced our second new “Big Five” customer win on August 10, and on August 22 we announced that our agreement got signed. While in our announcements we stated that rampup would begin early in the fourth quarter, I’m pleased to report that we were able to kick things off at the tail end of the third quarter. While we had a bit of revenue from this customer in the third quarter, we anticipate that revenue from this customer will impact our fourth quarter results more significantly. We are now in discussions with this customer about scope of the initial program – which has the potential to be quite large – as well as other programs. The customer has authorized $2.5 million in spend to get us started, has promised that an additional $1.5 million authorization will arrive soon, and has stated that it intends to supplement these authorizations as we move forward with program expansion. “On June 27, we announced that an existing Big Five customer had selected us to perform AI data annotation and LLM fine-tuning as a while-labeled service for its cloud and platform customers, and on June 14, we announced that this same customer had engaged us for its LLM build program. In this latter announcement, we stated that we anticipated potentially exceeding $8 million in revenue from this customer in 2023, up from approximately $3 million last year. We believe that we are on track to meet or exceed this target. Included in this year’s forecast is approximately $330 thousand of revenue from the white label program, consisting of six won or late-stage opportunities. We believe this white label program will contribute more significantly to 2024. For 2024, we already have several million in pipeline opportunities, including two opportunities that we value at $2 million and $1 million, respectively. It is worth noting that we believe the $2 million opportunity could potentially open an exciting new market for us. We are hoping to close both of these opportunities in Q1. Under the white label program, we are seeing a mix of requirements from our customer’s enterprise customers. Requirements range from generative AI data pipelines to two- and three-dimensional data annotation; chatbot fine-tuning; LLM-based search and retrieval; and training LLMs for multi-lingual, domain-specific summarization and conversation. Importantly, the program is enabling us to potentially scale an enterprise offering independent of our own sales and marketing; to leverage both our customer’s brand and its significant customer reach; and to gain exposure to a wide range of early-adopter generative AI use cases. “We believe this exposure will set us up well for what we believe will potentially be our largest and most significant opportunity – LLMs for the enterprise.

These forward-looking statements are based on management’s current expectations, assumptions and estimates and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including without limitation, impacts resulting from the continuing conflict between Russia and the Ukraine and Hamas’ attack against Israel and the ensuing conflict; investments in large language models; that contracts may be terminated by customers; projected or committed volumes of work may not materialize; pipeline opportunities and customer discussions which may not materialize into work or expected volumes of work; continuing reliance on project-based work in the Digital Data Solutions (“DDS”) segment and the primarily at-will nature of such contracts and the ability of these customers to reduce, delay or cancel projects; the likelihood of continued development of the markets, particularly new and emerging markets, that our services support; continuing DDS segment revenue concentration in a limited number of customers; potential inability to replace projects that are completed, canceled or reduced; our dependency on content providers in our Agility segment; difficulty in integrating and deriving synergies from acquisitions, joint venture and strategic investments; potential undiscovered liabilities of companies and businesses that we may acquire; potential impairment of the carrying value of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets of companies and businesses that we acquire; a continued downturn in or depressed market conditions; changes in external market factors; the ability and willingness of our customers and prospective customers to execute business plans that give rise to requirements for our services; changes in our business or growth strategy; the emergence of new, or growth in existing competitors; various other competitive and technological factors; our use of and reliance on information technology systems, including potential security breaches, cyber-attacks, privacy breaches or data breaches that result in the unauthorized disclosure of consumer, customer, employee or Company information, or service interruptions; and other risks and uncertainties indicated from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Company Contact Marcia Novero Innodata Inc. Mnovero@innodata.com (201) 371-8015 Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to the financial information prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP (“GAAP”), we provide certain non-GAAP financial information. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures assist investors in making comparisons of period-to-period operating results. In some respects, management believes non-GAAP financial measures are more indicative of our ongoing core operating performance than their GAAP equivalents by making adjustments that management believes are reflective of the ongoing performance of the business. We believe that the presentation of this non-GAAP financial information provides investors with greater transparency by providing investors a more complete understanding of our financial performance, competitive position, and prospects for the future, particularly by providing the same information that management and our Board of Directors use to evaluate our performance and manage the business. However, the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this press release have certain limitations in that they do not reflect all of the costs associated with the operations of our business as determined in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, investors should consider non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or as superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Further, the non-GAAP financial measures that we present may differ from similar non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) attributable to Innodata Inc. and its subsidiaries in accordance with U.S. GAAP before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization of intangible assets (which derives EBITDA), plus additional adjustments for loss on impairment of intangible assets and goodwill, stock-based compensation, income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, non-recurring severance, and other one-time costs. We use Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate core results of operations and trends between fiscal periods and believe that these measures are important components of our internal performance measurement process. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is included in the tables that accompany this release. INNODATA INC.

Jim Taiclet, American Tower’s Chief Executive Officer, stated, “We had another strong quarter in Q2 2019, highlighted by 7.5% Organic Tenant Billings Growth in the U.S. and sustained momentum across our international operations. U.S. consumer demand for mobile data continues to expand more than 30% per year, with broadly similar usage growth rates in our overseas markets fueling ongoing demand for tower space. In addition, initial 5G deployments are now picking up in the U.S. and we are seeing increasing signs that low and mid-band spectrum on macro towers will serve as a substantial component of next generation networks. Our strong second quarter results indicate that our Stand and Deliver strategy of leading wireless connectivity around the globe predominantly with macro towers, innovating for a mobile future, driving efficiency both internally and for the industry and selectively growing our portfolio to serve our tenants is the right course for American Tower and our stockholders. Moreover, the success of this strategy and effective operational execution across our served markets has led us to raise our full year expectations for all of our key metrics as we drive towards a successful second half of 2019.” CONSOLIDATED OPERATING RESULTS OVERVIEW American Tower generated the following operating results for the quarter ended June 30, 2019 (all comparative information is presented against the quarter ended June 30, 2018).

The Company used the net proceeds to repay existing indebtedness under its credit facilities. FULL YEAR 2019 OUTLOOK The following full year 2019 financial and operational estimates are based on a number of assumptions that management believes to be reasonable and reflect the Company’s expectations as of July 31, 2019. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates as a result of various factors, and the Company refers you to the cautionary language regarding “forward-looking” statements included in this press release when considering this information. The Company’s outlook is based on the following average foreign currency exchange rates to 1.00 U.S. Dollar for July 31, 2019 through December 31, 2019: (a) 46.90 Argentinean Pesos; (b) 3.85 Brazilian Reais; (c) 700 Chilean Pesos; (d) 3,270 Colombian Pesos; (e) 0.89 Euros; (f) 5.45 Ghanaian Cedi; (g) 69.80 Indian Rupees; (h) 102 Kenyan Shillings; (i) 19.50 Mexican Pesos; (j) 360 Nigerian Naira; (k) 6,260 Paraguayan Guarani; (l) 3.35 Peruvian Soles; (m) 14.40 South African Rand; and (n) 3,770 Ugandan Shillings. The Company is raising the midpoint of its full year 2019 outlook for property revenue, net income, Adjusted EBITDA and Consolidated AFFO by $60 million, $15 million, $60 million and $70 million, respectively. The Company’s outlook reflects estimated unfavorable impacts of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to property revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and Consolidated AFFO, of approximately $3 million, $3 million and $6 million, respectively, as compared to the Company’s prior 2019 outlook. The impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on net income is not provided, as the impact on all components of the net income measure cannot be calculated without unreasonable effort. The Company’s full year 2019 outlook also reflects estimated cumulative expected unfavorable impacts of ICCC on property revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and Consolidated AFFO of approximately $375 million, $261 million and $209 million, respectively, inclusive of an expected reduction in pass-through revenue of approximately $85 million and the benefit of approximately $9 million of settlement payments related to ICCC in prior periods, which was not contemplated within the Company’s prior outlook. The expected 2019-specific impacts of ICCC to property revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and Consolidated AFFO are $186 million, $141 million and $113 million, respectively, including $24 million in lower pass-through revenue and the expected benefit of the settlement payments. At this time, the Company expects the impacts of ICCC to last throughout 2019 and anticipates that churn rates in India will return to lower levels in 2020 and beyond. The Company is providing key outlook measures adjusted to quantify the impacts of ICCC on such measures and the impact of ICCC and the Company’s settlement with Tata Teleservices and related entities (“Tata”) in the fourth quarter of 2018 on growth rates as it believes that these adjusted measures better reflect the long-term trajectory of its recurring business and provide investors with a more comprehensive analysis of the Company’s operations. The impacts of ICCC and the Tata settlement on net income are not provided, as the impact on all components of the net income measure cannot be calculated without unreasonable effort. Additional information pertaining to the impact of foreign currency, London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) fluctuations and ICCC on the Company’s outlook has been provided in the supplemental disclosure package available on the Company’s website. 3 2019 Outlook ($ in millions) Full Year 2019 Midpoint Growth Rates vs. Prior Year Total property revenue (1) $ 7,205 to $ 7,335 (0.6)% Net income 1,590 to 1,660 28.5% Adjusted EBITDA 4,490 to 4,570 (2.9)% Consolidated AFFO 3,460 to 3,530 (1.2)% _______________ (1) Includes U.S. property revenue of $ 3,960 million to $ 4,020 million and international property revenue of $ 3,245 million to $ 3,315 million, reflecting midpoint growth rates of 4.4% and (6.1)% , respectively.

In addition, the Company presents: Tenant Billings, Tenant Billings Growth, Organic Tenant Billings Growth and New Site Tenant Billings Growth. These measures are not intended to replace financial performance measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Rather, they are presented as additional information because management believes they are useful indicators of the current financial performance of the Company's core businesses and are commonly used across its industry peer group. As outlined in detail below, the Company believes that these measures can assist in comparing company performance on a consistent basis irrespective of depreciation and amortization or capital structure, while also providing valuable incremental insight into the underlying operating trends of its business. Depreciation and amortization can vary significantly among companies depending on accounting methods, particularly where acquisitions or non-operating factors, including historical cost basis, are involved. The Company's Non-GAAP and Defined Financial Measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Revenue Components In addition to reporting total revenue, the Company believes that providing transparency around the components of its revenue provides investors with insight into the indicators of the underlying demand for, and operating performance of, its real estate portfolio. Accordingly, the Company has provided disclosure of the following revenue components: (i) Tenant Billings, (ii) New Site Tenant Billings; (iii) Organic Tenant Billings; (iv) International pass-through revenue; (v) Straight-line revenue; (vi) Pre-paid amortization revenue; (vii) Foreign currency exchange impact; and (viii) Other revenue. Tenant Billings: The majority of the Company’s revenue is generated from non-cancellable, long-term tenant leases. Revenue from Tenant Billings reflects several key aspects of the Company’s real estate business: (i) “colocations/amendments” reflects new tenant leases for space on existing sites and amendments to existing leases to add additional tenant equipment; (ii) “escalations” reflects contractual increases in billing rates, which are typically tied to fixed percentages or a variable percentage based on a consumer price index; (iii) “cancellations” reflects the impact of tenant lease terminations or non-renewals or, in limited circumstances, when the lease rates on existing leases are reduced; and (iv) “new sites” reflects the impact of new property construction and acquisitions. New Site Tenant Billings: Day-one Tenant Billings associated with sites that have been built or acquired since the beginning of the prior-year period. Incremental colocations/amendments, escalations or cancellations that occur on these sites after the date of their addition to our portfolio are not included in New Site Tenant Billings. The Company believes providing New Site Tenant Billings enhances an investor’s ability to analyze the Company’s existing real estate portfolio growth as well as its development program growth, as the Company’s construction and acquisition activities can drive variability in growth rates from period to period. Organic Tenant Billings: Tenant Billings on sites that the Company has owned since the beginning of the prior-year period, as well as Tenant Billings activity on new sites that occurred after the date of their addition to the Company’s portfolio. International pass-through revenue: A portion of the Company’s pass-through revenue is based on power and fuel expense reimbursements and therefore subject to fluctuations in fuel prices. As a result, revenue growth rates may fluctuate depending on the market price for fuel in any given period, which is not representative of the Company’s real estate business and its economic exposure to power and fuel costs. Furthermore, this expense reimbursement mitigates the economic impact associated with fluctuations in operating expenses, such as power and fuel costs and land rents in certain of the Company’s markets. As a result, the Company believes that it is appropriate to provide insight into the impact of pass-through revenue on certain revenue growth rates. Straight-line revenue: Under GAAP, the Company recognizes revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract for certain of its tenant leases. Due to the Company’s significant base of non-cancellable, long-term tenant leases, this can result in significant fluctuations in growth rates upon tenant lease signings and renewals (typically increases), when amounts billed or received upfront upon these events are initially deferred. These signings and renewals are only a portion of the Company’s underlying business growth and can distort the underlying performance of our Tenant Billings Growth. As a result, the Company believes that it is appropriate to provide insight into the impact of straight-line revenue on certain growth rates in revenue and select other measures. Pre-paid amortization revenue: The Company recovers a portion of the costs it incurs for the redevelopment and development of its properties from its tenants. These upfront payments are then amortized over the initial term of the corresponding tenant lease. Given this amortization is not necessarily directly representative of underlying leasing activity on its real estate portfolio, (i.e. does not have a renewal option or escalation as our tenant leases do) the Company believes that it is appropriate to provide insight into the impact of pre-paid amortization revenue on certain revenue growth rates to provide transparency into the underlying performance of our real estate business. Foreign currency exchange impact: The majority of the Company’s international revenue and operating expenses are denominated in each country’s local currency. As a result, foreign currency fluctuations may distort the underlying performance of our real estate business from 6 period to period, depending on the movement of foreign currency exchange rates versus the U.S. Dollar. The Company believes it is appropriate to quantify the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on its reported growth to provide transparency into the underlying performance of its real estate business. Other revenue: Other revenue represents revenue not captured by the above listed items and can include items such as tenant settlements and fiber solutions revenue. Non-GAAP and Defined Financial Measure Definitions Tenant Billings Growth: The increase or decrease resulting from a comparison of Tenant Billings for a current period with Tenant Billings for the corresponding prior-year period, in each case adjusted for foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The Company believes this measure provides valuable insight into the growth in recurring Tenant Billings and underlying demand for its real estate portfolio. Organic Tenant Billings Growth: The portion of Tenant Billings Growth attributable to Organic Tenant Billings. The Company believes that organic growth is a useful measure of its ability to add tenancy and incremental revenue to its assets for the reported period, which enables investors and analysts to gain additional insight into the relative attractiveness, and therefore the value, of the Company’s property assets. New Site Tenant Billings Growth: The portion of Tenant Billings Growth attributable to New Site Tenant Billings. The Company believes this measure provides valuable insight into the growth attributable to Tenant Billings from recently acquired or constructed properties. Indian Carrier Consolidation-Driven Churn (ICCC): Tenant cancellations specifically attributable to short-term carrier consolidation in India. Includes impacts of carrier exits from the marketplace and carrier cancellations as a result of consolidation, but excludes normal course churn. The Company believes that providing this additional metric enhances transparency and provides a better understanding of its recurring business without the impact of what it believes to be a transitory event. Gross Margin: Revenues less operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation expense recorded in costs of operations, depreciation, amortization and accretion, selling, general, administrative and development expense and other operating expenses. The Company believes this measure provides valuable insight into the site-level profitability of its assets. Operating Profit: Gross Margin less selling, general, administrative and development expense, excluding stock-based compensation expense and corporate expenses. The Company believes this measure provides valuable insight into the site-level profitability of its assets while also taking into account the overhead expenses required to manage each of its operating segments. For segment reporting purposes, in periods through the third quarter of 2018, the Latin America property segment Operating Profit and Gross Margin also include interest income (expense), TV Azteca, net. Operating Profit and Gross Margin are before interest income, interest expense, gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations, other income (expense), net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest and income tax benefit (provision). Operating Profit Margin: The percentage that results from dividing Operating Profit by revenue. Adjusted EBITDA: Net income before income (loss) from equity method investments, income tax benefit (provision), other income (expense), gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations, interest expense, interest income, other operating income (expense), depreciation, amortization and accretion and stock-based compensation expense. The Company believes this measure provides valuable insight into the profitability of its operations while at the same time taking into account the central overhead expenses required to manage its global operations. In addition, it is a widely used performance measure across the telecommunications real estate sector. Adjusted EBITDA Margin: The percentage that results from dividing Adjusted EBITDA by total revenue. Nareit Funds From Operations (FFO), as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (Nareit), attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders: Net income before gains or losses from the sale or disposal of real estate, real estate related impairment charges, real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion and dividends on preferred stock, and including adjustments for (i) unconsolidated affiliates and (ii) noncontrolling interests. The Company believes this measure provides valuable insight into the operating performance of its property assets by excluding the charges described above, particularly depreciation expenses, given the high initial, up-front capital intensity of the Company’s operating model. In addition, it is a widely used performance measure across the telecommunications real estate sector. Consolidated Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO): Nareit FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders before (i) straight-line revenue and expense, (ii) stock-based compensation expense, (iii) the deferred portion of income tax, (iv) non-real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion, (v) amortization of deferred financing costs, capitalized interest, debt discounts and premiums and long-term deferred interest charges, (vi) other income (expense), (vii) gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations, (viii) other operating income (expense), and adjustments for (ix) unconsolidated affiliates and (x) noncontrolling interests, less cash payments related to capital improvements and cash payments related to corporate capital expenditures. The Company believes this measure provides valuable insight into the operating performance of its property assets by further adjusting the Nareit FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders metric to exclude the factors outlined above, which if unadjusted, may cause material fluctuations in Nareit FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders growth from period to period that would not be representative of the 7 underlying performance of the Company’s property assets in those periods. In addition, it is a widely used performance measure across the telecommunications real estate sector. Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO) attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders: Consolidated AFFO, excluding the impact of noncontrolling interests on both Nareit FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders and the other line items included in the calculation of Consolidated AFFO. The Company believes that providing this additional metric enhances transparency, given the minority interests in its Indian and European businesses. Consolidated AFFO per Share: Consolidated AFFO divided by the diluted weighted average common shares outstanding. AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders per Share: AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders divided by the diluted weighted average common shares outstanding. Free Cash Flow: Cash provided by operating activities less total cash capital expenditures, including payments on finance leases and perpetual land easements. The Company believes that Free Cash Flow is useful to investors as the basis for comparing our performance and coverage ratios with other companies in its industry, although this measure of Free Cash Flow may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies. Net Debt: Total long-term debt, including current portion and finance lease liabilities, less cash and cash equivalents. Net Leverage Ratio: Net Debt divided by the quarter’s annualized Adjusted EBITDA (the quarter’s Adjusted EBITDA multiplied by four). The Company believes that including this calculation is important for investors and analysts given it is a critical component underlying its credit agency ratings.

Actual results may differ materially from those indicated in our forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including: (1) a significant decrease in leasing demand for our communications infrastructure would materially and adversely affect our business and operating results, and we cannot control that demand; (2) increasing competition within our industry may materially and adversely affect our revenue; (3) if our tenants consolidate their operations, exit the telecommunications business or share site infrastructure to a significant degree, our growth, revenue and ability to generate positive cash flows could be materially and adversely affected; (4) our business is subject to government and tax regulations and changes in current or future laws or regulations could restrict our ability to operate our business as we currently do or impact our competitive landscape; (5) our foreign operations are subject to economic, political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position, including risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; (6) a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of tenants, and we are sensitive to changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our tenants; (7) our expansion initiatives involve a number of risks and uncertainties, including those related to integrating acquired or leased assets, that could adversely affect our operating results, disrupt our operations or expose us to additional risk; (8) new technologies or changes in our or a tenant’s business model could make our tower leasing business less desirable and result in decreasing revenues and operating results; (9) competition for assets could adversely affect our ability to achieve our return on investment criteria; (10) our leverage and debt service obligations may materially and adversely affect our ability to raise additional financing to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives and to satisfy our distribution requirements; (11) if we fail to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT, we will be subject to tax at corporate income tax rates, which may substantially reduce funds otherwise available, and even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may face tax liabilities that impact earnings and available cash flow; (12) complying with REIT requirements may limit our flexibility or cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities; (13) restrictive covenants in the agreements related to our securitization transactions, our credit facilities and our debt securities could materially and adversely affect our business by limiting flexibility, and we may be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock, which may jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a REIT; (14) our towers, fiber networks, data centers or computer systems may be affected by natural disasters, security breaches and other unforeseen events for which our insurance may not provide adequate coverage; (15) our costs could increase and our revenues could decrease due to perceived health risks from radio emissions, especially if these perceived risks are substantiated; (16) we could have liability under environmental and occupational safety and health laws; (17) if we are unable to protect our rights to the land under our towers, it could adversely affect our business and operating results; and (18) if we are unable or choose not to exercise our rights to purchase towers that are subject to lease and sublease agreements at the end of the applicable period, our cash flows derived from those towers will be eliminated. For additional information regarding factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in our forward-looking statements, we refer you to the information contained in Item 1A of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, under the caption “Risk Factors”. We undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this press release to reflect subsequently occurring events or circumstances. 8 UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (In millions) June 30, 2019 December 31, 2018 ASSETS CURRENT ASSETS: Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,192.2 $ 1,208.7 Restricted cash 93.8 96.2 Accounts receivable, net 459.5 459.0 Prepaid and other current assets 486.9 621.2 Total current assets 2,232.4 2,385.1 PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, net 11,268.6 11,247.1 GOODWILL 5,557.8 5,501.9 OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, net 10,895.2 11,174.3 DEFERRED TAX ASSET 147.8 157.7 DEFERRED RENT ASSET 1,597.1 1,581.7 RIGHT-OF-USE ASSET (1) 7,110.0 — NOTES RECEIVABLE AND OTHER NON-CURRENT ASSETS 263.8 962.6 TOTAL $ 39,072.7 $ 33,010.4 LIABILITIES CURRENT LIABILITIES: Accounts payable $ 144.9 $ 130.8 Accrued expenses 835.6 948.3 Distributions payable 413.0 377.4 Accrued interest 154.2 174.5 Current portion of operating lease liability (1) 496.9 — Current portion of long-term obligations 2,442.2 2,754.8 Unearned revenue 334.8 304.1 Total current liabilities 4,821.6 4,689.9 LONG-TERM OBLIGATIONS 18,615.9 18,405.1 OPERATING LEASE LIABILITY (1) 6,335.4 — ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS 1,252.3 1,210.0 DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY 546.2 535.9 OTHER NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES 868.0 1,265.1 Total liabilities 32,439.4 26,106.0 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES REDEEMABLE NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS 590.2 1,004.8 EQUITY: Common stock 4.5 4.5 Additional paid-in capital 10,492.7 10,380.8 Distributions in excess of earnings (1,206.2 ) (1,199.5 ) Accumulated other comprehensive loss (2,606.7 ) (2,642.9 ) Treasury stock (1,206.8 ) (1,206.8 ) Total American Tower Corporation equity 5,477.5 5,336.1 Noncontrolling interests 565.6 563.5 Total equity 6,043.1 5,899.6 TOTAL $ 39,072.7 $ 33,010.4 _______________ (1) Reflects the new lease accounting standard requiring a right-of-use model. 9 UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS (In millions, except share and per share data) Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2019 2018 2019 2018 REVENUES: Property $ 1,848.9 $ 1,749.4 $ 3,634.9 $ 3,459.8 Services 40.7 31.5 68.1 62.9 Total operating revenues 1,889.6 1,780.9 3,703.0 3,522.7 OPERATING EXPENSES: Costs of operations (exclusive of items shown separately below): Property (1) 549.4 547.2 1,082.4 1,054.6 Services (1) 13.9 13.1 24.3 25.6 Depreciation, amortization and accretion 448.9 449.7 885.8 896.0 Selling, general, administrative and development expense (1)(2) 164.8 157.9 362.9 362.8 Other operating expenses (3) 28.7 67.0 48.8 234.8 Total operating expenses 1,205.7 1,234.9 2,404.2 2,573.8 OPERATING INCOME 683.9 546.0 1,298.8 948.9 OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE): Interest expense, TV Azteca — (3.4 ) — (0.7 ) Interest income 11.7 18.4 24.1 33.8 Interest expense (204.5 ) (207.9 ) (412.0 ) (407.5 ) Loss on retirement of long-term obligations (22.1 ) — (22.2 ) — Other (expense) income (including foreign currency (losses) gains of $(5.3), $(40.4), $14.8 and $(17.1), respectively) (5.1 ) (34.8 ) 16.8 (7.0 ) Total other expense (220.0 ) (227.7 ) (393.3 ) (381.4 ) INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAXES 463.9 318.3 905.5 567.5 Income tax (provision) benefit (4) (29.6 ) (3.9 ) (63.6 ) 27.2 NET INCOME 434.3 314.4 841.9 594.7 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (5.2 ) (7.7 ) (15.4 ) (2.8 ) NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION STOCKHOLDERS 429.1 306.7 826.5 591.9 Dividends on preferred stock — — — (9.4 ) NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION COMMON STOCKHOLDERS $ 429.1 $ 306.7 $ 826.5 $ 582.5 NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE AMOUNTS: Basic net income attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders $ 0.97 $ 0.69 $ 1.87 $ 1.33 Diluted net income attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders $ 0.96 $ 0.69 $ 1.86 $ 1.32 WEIGHTED AVERAGE COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING (in thousands): BASIC 442,203 441,497 441,778 438,328 DILUTED 445,337 444,362 445,040 441,513 _______________ (1) Property costs of operations, services costs of operations and selling, general, administrative and development expense include stock-based compensation expense in aggregate amounts of $21.9 million and $64.4 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, respectively, and $24.8 million and $67.5 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively.

Jim Taiclet, American Tower’s Chief Executive Officer, stated, “We had another strong quarter in Q2 2019, highlighted by 7.5% Organic Tenant Billings Growth in the U.S. and sustained momentum across our international operations. U.S. consumer demand for mobile data continues to expand more than 30% per year, with broadly similar usage growth rates in our overseas markets fueling ongoing demand for tower space. In addition, initial 5G deployments are now picking up in the U.S. and we are seeing increasing signs that low and mid-band spectrum on macro towers will serve as a substantial component of next generation networks. Our strong second quarter results indicate that our Stand and Deliver strategy of leading wireless connectivity around the globe predominantly with macro towers, innovating for a mobile future, driving efficiency both internally and for the industry and selectively growing our portfolio to serve our tenants is the right course for American Tower and our stockholders. Moreover, the success of this strategy and effective operational execution across our served markets has led us to raise our full year expectations for all of our key metrics as we drive towards a successful second half of 2019.” CONSOLIDATED OPERATING RESULTS OVERVIEW American Tower generated the following operating results for the quarter ended June 30, 2019 (all comparative information is presented against the quarter ended June 30, 2018).

We are disclosing the additional financial metrics below to provide insight into the underlying long-term trends across the Company’s business excluding these impacts. We expect ICCC to impact our operational and financial results at varying rates throughout the remainder of 2019 and to result in an overall reduction in Indian contracted tenant revenue. The impacts of ICCC on net income are not provided, as the impact on all components of the net income measure cannot be reasonably calculated.

Liquidity – As of June 30, 2019 , the Company had $5.5 billion of total liquidity, consisting of $1.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents plus the ability to borrow an aggregate of $4.3 billion under its revolving credit facilities, net of any outstanding letters of credit. On April 22, 2019, the Company completed its previously announced redemption of all of its outstanding 5.050% senior unsecured notes due 2020 for an aggregate principal amount of $700 million. On June 13, 2019, the Company issued $650.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.950% senior unsecured notes due 2025 and $1.65 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.800% senior unsecured notes due 2029. The Company used the net proceeds to repay existing indebtedness under its credit facilities. FULL YEAR 2019 OUTLOOK The following full year 2019 financial and operational estimates are based on a number of assumptions that management believes to be reasonable and reflect the Company’s expectations as of July 31, 2019. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates as a result of various factors, and the Company refers you to the cautionary language regarding “forward-looking” statements included in this press release when considering this information. The Company’s outlook is based on the following average foreign currency exchange rates to 1.00 U.S. Dollar for July 31, 2019 through December 31, 2019: (a) 46.90 Argentinean Pesos; (b) 3.85 Brazilian Reais; (c) 700 Chilean Pesos; (d) 3,270 Colombian Pesos; (e) 0.89 Euros; (f) 5.45 Ghanaian Cedi; (g) 69.80 Indian Rupees; (h) 102 Kenyan Shillings; (i) 19.50 Mexican Pesos; (j) 360 Nigerian Naira; (k) 6,260 Paraguayan Guarani; (l) 3.35 Peruvian Soles; (m) 14.40 South African Rand; and (n) 3,770 Ugandan Shillings. The Company is raising the midpoint of its full year 2019 outlook for property revenue, net income, Adjusted EBITDA and Consolidated AFFO by $60 million, $15 million, $60 million and $70 million, respectively. The Company’s outlook reflects estimated unfavorable impacts of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to property revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and Consolidated AFFO, of approximately $3 million, $3 million and $6 million, respectively, as compared to the Company’s prior 2019 outlook. The impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on net income is not provided, as the impact on all components of the net income measure cannot be calculated without unreasonable effort. The Company’s full year 2019 outlook also reflects estimated cumulative expected unfavorable impacts of ICCC on property revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and Consolidated AFFO of approximately $375 million, $261 million and $209 million, respectively, inclusive of an expected reduction in pass-through revenue of approximately $85 million and the benefit of approximately $9 million of settlement payments related to ICCC in prior periods, which was not contemplated within the Company’s prior outlook. The expected 2019-specific impacts of ICCC to property revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and Consolidated AFFO are $186 million, $141 million and $113 million, respectively, including $24 million in lower pass-through revenue and the expected benefit of the settlement payments. At this time, the Company expects the impacts of ICCC to last throughout 2019 and anticipates that churn rates in India will return to lower levels in 2020 and beyond. The Company is providing key outlook measures adjusted to quantify the impacts of ICCC on such measures and the impact of ICCC and the Company’s settlement with Tata Teleservices and related entities (“Tata”) in the fourth quarter of 2018 on growth rates as it believes that these adjusted measures better reflect the long-term trajectory of its recurring business and provide investors with a more comprehensive analysis of the Company’s operations. The impacts of ICCC and the Tata settlement on net income are not provided, as the impact on all components of the net income measure cannot be calculated without unreasonable effort. Additional information pertaining to the impact of foreign currency, London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) fluctuations and ICCC on the Company’s outlook has been provided in the supplemental disclosure package available on the Company’s website. 3 2019 Outlook ($ in millions) Full Year 2019 Midpoint Growth Rates vs. Prior Year Total property revenue (1) $ 7,205 to $ 7,335 (0.6)% Net income 1,590 to 1,660 28.5% Adjusted EBITDA 4,490 to 4,570 (2.9)% Consolidated AFFO 3,460 to 3,530 (1.2)% _______________ (1) Includes U.S. property revenue of $ 3,960 million to $ 4,020 million and international property revenue of $ 3,245 million to $ 3,315 million, reflecting midpoint growth rates of 4.4% and (6.1)% , respectively.

In addition, the Company presents: Tenant Billings, Tenant Billings Growth, Organic Tenant Billings Growth and New Site Tenant Billings Growth. These measures are not intended to replace financial performance measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Rather, they are presented as additional information because management believes they are useful indicators of the current financial performance of the Company's core businesses and are commonly used across its industry peer group. As outlined in detail below, the Company believes that these measures can assist in comparing company performance on a consistent basis irrespective of depreciation and amortization or capital structure, while also providing valuable incremental insight into the underlying operating trends of its business. Depreciation and amortization can vary significantly among companies depending on accounting methods, particularly where acquisitions or non-operating factors, including historical cost basis, are involved. The Company's Non-GAAP and Defined Financial Measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Revenue Components In addition to reporting total revenue, the Company believes that providing transparency around the components of its revenue provides investors with insight into the indicators of the underlying demand for, and operating performance of, its real estate portfolio. Accordingly, the Company has provided disclosure of the following revenue components: (i) Tenant Billings, (ii) New Site Tenant Billings; (iii) Organic Tenant Billings; (iv) International pass-through revenue; (v) Straight-line revenue; (vi) Pre-paid amortization revenue; (vii) Foreign currency exchange impact; and (viii) Other revenue. Tenant Billings: The majority of the Company’s revenue is generated from non-cancellable, long-term tenant leases. Revenue from Tenant Billings reflects several key aspects of the Company’s real estate business: (i) “colocations/amendments” reflects new tenant leases for space on existing sites and amendments to existing leases to add additional tenant equipment; (ii) “escalations” reflects contractual increases in billing rates, which are typically tied to fixed percentages or a variable percentage based on a consumer price index; (iii) “cancellations” reflects the impact of tenant lease terminations or non-renewals or, in limited circumstances, when the lease rates on existing leases are reduced; and (iv) “new sites” reflects the impact of new property construction and acquisitions. New Site Tenant Billings: Day-one Tenant Billings associated with sites that have been built or acquired since the beginning of the prior-year period. Incremental colocations/amendments, escalations or cancellations that occur on these sites after the date of their addition to our portfolio are not included in New Site Tenant Billings. The Company believes providing New Site Tenant Billings enhances an investor’s ability to analyze the Company’s existing real estate portfolio growth as well as its development program growth, as the Company’s construction and acquisition activities can drive variability in growth rates from period to period. Organic Tenant Billings: Tenant Billings on sites that the Company has owned since the beginning of the prior-year period, as well as Tenant Billings activity on new sites that occurred after the date of their addition to the Company’s portfolio. International pass-through revenue: A portion of the Company’s pass-through revenue is based on power and fuel expense reimbursements and therefore subject to fluctuations in fuel prices. As a result, revenue growth rates may fluctuate depending on the market price for fuel in any given period, which is not representative of the Company’s real estate business and its economic exposure to power and fuel costs. Furthermore, this expense reimbursement mitigates the economic impact associated with fluctuations in operating expenses, such as power and fuel costs and land rents in certain of the Company’s markets. As a result, the Company believes that it is appropriate to provide insight into the impact of pass-through revenue on certain revenue growth rates. Straight-line revenue: Under GAAP, the Company recognizes revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract for certain of its tenant leases. Due to the Company’s significant base of non-cancellable, long-term tenant leases, this can result in significant fluctuations in growth rates upon tenant lease signings and renewals (typically increases), when amounts billed or received upfront upon these events are initially deferred. These signings and renewals are only a portion of the Company’s underlying business growth and can distort the underlying performance of our Tenant Billings Growth. As a result, the Company believes that it is appropriate to provide insight into the impact of straight-line revenue on certain growth rates in revenue and select other measures. Pre-paid amortization revenue: The Company recovers a portion of the costs it incurs for the redevelopment and development of its properties from its tenants. These upfront payments are then amortized over the initial term of the corresponding tenant lease. Given this amortization is not necessarily directly representative of underlying leasing activity on its real estate portfolio, (i.e. does not have a renewal option or escalation as our tenant leases do) the Company believes that it is appropriate to provide insight into the impact of pre-paid amortization revenue on certain revenue growth rates to provide transparency into the underlying performance of our real estate business. Foreign currency exchange impact: The majority of the Company’s international revenue and operating expenses are denominated in each country’s local currency. As a result, foreign currency fluctuations may distort the underlying performance of our real estate business from 6 period to period, depending on the movement of foreign currency exchange rates versus the U.S. Dollar. The Company believes it is appropriate to quantify the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on its reported growth to provide transparency into the underlying performance of its real estate business. Other revenue: Other revenue represents revenue not captured by the above listed items and can include items such as tenant settlements and fiber solutions revenue. Non-GAAP and Defined Financial Measure Definitions Tenant Billings Growth: The increase or decrease resulting from a comparison of Tenant Billings for a current period with Tenant Billings for the corresponding prior-year period, in each case adjusted for foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The Company believes this measure provides valuable insight into the growth in recurring Tenant Billings and underlying demand for its real estate portfolio. Organic Tenant Billings Growth: The portion of Tenant Billings Growth attributable to Organic Tenant Billings. The Company believes that organic growth is a useful measure of its ability to add tenancy and incremental revenue to its assets for the reported period, which enables investors and analysts to gain additional insight into the relative attractiveness, and therefore the value, of the Company’s property assets. New Site Tenant Billings Growth: The portion of Tenant Billings Growth attributable to New Site Tenant Billings. The Company believes this measure provides valuable insight into the growth attributable to Tenant Billings from recently acquired or constructed properties. Indian Carrier Consolidation-Driven Churn (ICCC): Tenant cancellations specifically attributable to short-term carrier consolidation in India. Includes impacts of carrier exits from the marketplace and carrier cancellations as a result of consolidation, but excludes normal course churn. The Company believes that providing this additional metric enhances transparency and provides a better understanding of its recurring business without the impact of what it believes to be a transitory event. Gross Margin: Revenues less operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation expense recorded in costs of operations, depreciation, amortization and accretion, selling, general, administrative and development expense and other operating expenses. The Company believes this measure provides valuable insight into the site-level profitability of its assets. Operating Profit: Gross Margin less selling, general, administrative and development expense, excluding stock-based compensation expense and corporate expenses. The Company believes this measure provides valuable insight into the site-level profitability of its assets while also taking into account the overhead expenses required to manage each of its operating segments. For segment reporting purposes, in periods through the third quarter of 2018, the Latin America property segment Operating Profit and Gross Margin also include interest income (expense), TV Azteca, net. Operating Profit and Gross Margin are before interest income, interest expense, gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations, other income (expense), net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest and income tax benefit (provision). Operating Profit Margin: The percentage that results from dividing Operating Profit by revenue. Adjusted EBITDA: Net income before income (loss) from equity method investments, income tax benefit (provision), other income (expense), gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations, interest expense, interest income, other operating income (expense), depreciation, amortization and accretion and stock-based compensation expense. The Company believes this measure provides valuable insight into the profitability of its operations while at the same time taking into account the central overhead expenses required to manage its global operations. In addition, it is a widely used performance measure across the telecommunications real estate sector. Adjusted EBITDA Margin: The percentage that results from dividing Adjusted EBITDA by total revenue. Nareit Funds From Operations (FFO), as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (Nareit), attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders: Net income before gains or losses from the sale or disposal of real estate, real estate related impairment charges, real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion and dividends on preferred stock, and including adjustments for (i) unconsolidated affiliates and (ii) noncontrolling interests. The Company believes this measure provides valuable insight into the operating performance of its property assets by excluding the charges described above, particularly depreciation expenses, given the high initial, up-front capital intensity of the Company’s operating model. In addition, it is a widely used performance measure across the telecommunications real estate sector. Consolidated Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO): Nareit FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders before (i) straight-line revenue and expense, (ii) stock-based compensation expense, (iii) the deferred portion of income tax, (iv) non-real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion, (v) amortization of deferred financing costs, capitalized interest, debt discounts and premiums and long-term deferred interest charges, (vi) other income (expense), (vii) gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations, (viii) other operating income (expense), and adjustments for (ix) unconsolidated affiliates and (x) noncontrolling interests, less cash payments related to capital improvements and cash payments related to corporate capital expenditures. The Company believes this measure provides valuable insight into the operating performance of its property assets by further adjusting the Nareit FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders metric to exclude the factors outlined above, which if unadjusted, may cause material fluctuations in Nareit FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders growth from period to period that would not be representative of the 7 underlying performance of the Company’s property assets in those periods. In addition, it is a widely used performance measure across the telecommunications real estate sector. Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO) attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders: Consolidated AFFO, excluding the impact of noncontrolling interests on both Nareit FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders and the other line items included in the calculation of Consolidated AFFO. The Company believes that providing this additional metric enhances transparency, given the minority interests in its Indian and European businesses. Consolidated AFFO per Share: Consolidated AFFO divided by the diluted weighted average common shares outstanding. AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders per Share: AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders divided by the diluted weighted average common shares outstanding. Free Cash Flow: Cash provided by operating activities less total cash capital expenditures, including payments on finance leases and perpetual land easements. The Company believes that Free Cash Flow is useful to investors as the basis for comparing our performance and coverage ratios with other companies in its industry, although this measure of Free Cash Flow may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies. Net Debt: Total long-term debt, including current portion and finance lease liabilities, less cash and cash equivalents. Net Leverage Ratio: Net Debt divided by the quarter’s annualized Adjusted EBITDA (the quarter’s Adjusted EBITDA multiplied by four). The Company believes that including this calculation is important for investors and analysts given it is a critical component underlying its credit agency ratings. Cautionary Language Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This press release contains “forward-looking statements” concerning our goals, beliefs, expectations, strategies, objectives, plans, future operating results and underlying assumptions and other statements that are not necessarily based on historical facts. Examples of these statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our full year 2019 outlook and other targets, our expectations regarding Indian Carrier Consolidation-Driven Churn (ICCC) and factors that could affect such expectations, foreign currency exchange rates, our expectations for the closing of signed acquisitions, our expectations for the redemption of shares in ATC TIPL and our expectations regarding the leasing demand for communications real estate. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated in our forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including: (1) a significant decrease in leasing demand for our communications infrastructure would materially and adversely affect our business and operating results, and we cannot control that demand; (2) increasing competition within our industry may materially and adversely affect our revenue; (3) if our tenants consolidate their operations, exit the telecommunications business or share site infrastructure to a significant degree, our growth, revenue and ability to generate positive cash flows could be materially and adversely affected; (4) our business is subject to government and tax regulations and changes in current or future laws or regulations could restrict our ability to operate our business as we currently do or impact our competitive landscape; (5) our foreign operations are subject to economic, political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position, including risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; (6) a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of tenants, and we are sensitive to changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our tenants; (7) our expansion initiatives involve a number of risks and uncertainties, including those related to integrating acquired or leased assets, that could adversely affect our operating results, disrupt our operations or expose us to additional risk; (8) new technologies or changes in our or a tenant’s business model could make our tower leasing business less desirable and result in decreasing revenues and operating results; (9) competition for assets could adversely affect our ability to achieve our return on investment criteria; (10) our leverage and debt service obligations may materially and adversely affect our ability to raise additional financing to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives and to satisfy our distribution requirements; (11) if we fail to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT, we will be subject to tax at corporate income tax rates, which may substantially reduce funds otherwise available, and even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may face tax liabilities that impact earnings and available cash flow; (12) complying with REIT requirements may limit our flexibility or cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities; (13) restrictive covenants in the agreements related to our securitization transactions, our credit facilities and our debt securities could materially and adversely affect our business by limiting flexibility, and we may be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock, which may jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a REIT; (14) our towers, fiber networks, data centers or computer systems may be affected by natural disasters, security breaches and other unforeseen events for which our insurance may not provide adequate coverage; (15) our costs could increase and our revenues could decrease due to perceived health risks from radio emissions, especially if these perceived risks are substantiated; (16) we could have liability under environmental and occupational safety and health laws; (17) if we are unable to protect our rights to the land under our towers, it could adversely affect our business and operating results; and (18) if we are unable or choose not to exercise our rights to purchase towers that are subject to lease and sublease agreements at the end of the applicable period, our cash flows derived from those towers will be eliminated. For additional information regarding factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in our forward-looking statements, we refer you to the information contained in Item 1A of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, under the caption “Risk Factors”. We undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this press release to reflect subsequently occurring events or circumstances. 8 UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (In millions) June 30, 2019 December 31, 2018 ASSETS CURRENT ASSETS: Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,192.2 $ 1,208.7 Restricted cash 93.8 96.2 Accounts receivable, net 459.5 459.0 Prepaid and other current assets 486.9 621.2 Total current assets 2,232.4 2,385.1 PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, net 11,268.6 11,247.1 GOODWILL 5,557.8 5,501.9 OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, net 10,895.2 11,174.3 DEFERRED TAX ASSET 147.8 157.7 DEFERRED RENT ASSET 1,597.1 1,581.7 RIGHT-OF-USE ASSET (1) 7,110.0 — NOTES RECEIVABLE AND OTHER NON-CURRENT ASSETS 263.8 962.6 TOTAL $ 39,072.7 $ 33,010.4 LIABILITIES CURRENT LIABILITIES: Accounts payable $ 144.9 $ 130.8 Accrued expenses 835.6 948.3 Distributions payable 413.0 377.4 Accrued interest 154.2 174.5 Current portion of operating lease liability (1) 496.9 — Current portion of long-term obligations 2,442.2 2,754.8 Unearned revenue 334.8 304.1 Total current liabilities 4,821.6 4,689.9 LONG-TERM OBLIGATIONS 18,615.9 18,405.1 OPERATING LEASE LIABILITY (1) 6,335.4 — ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS 1,252.3 1,210.0 DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY 546.2 535.9 OTHER NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES 868.0 1,265.1 Total liabilities 32,439.4 26,106.0 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES REDEEMABLE NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS 590.2 1,004.8 EQUITY: Common stock 4.5 4.5 Additional paid-in capital 10,492.7 10,380.8 Distributions in excess of earnings (1,206.2 ) (1,199.5 ) Accumulated other comprehensive loss (2,606.7 ) (2,642.9 ) Treasury stock (1,206.8 ) (1,206.8 ) Total American Tower Corporation equity 5,477.5 5,336.1 Noncontrolling interests 565.6 563.5 Total equity 6,043.1 5,899.6 TOTAL $ 39,072.7 $ 33,010.4 _______________ (1) Reflects the new lease accounting standard requiring a right-of-use model. 9 UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS (In millions, except share and per share data) Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2019 2018 2019 2018 REVENUES: Property $ 1,848.9 $ 1,749.4 $ 3,634.9 $ 3,459.8 Services 40.7 31.5 68.1 62.9 Total operating revenues 1,889.6 1,780.9 3,703.0 3,522.7 OPERATING EXPENSES: Costs of operations (exclusive of items shown separately below): Property (1) 549.4 547.2 1,082.4 1,054.6 Services (1) 13.9 13.1 24.3 25.6 Depreciation, amortization and accretion 448.9 449.7 885.8 896.0 Selling, general, administrative and development expense (1)(2) 164.8 157.9 362.9 362.8 Other operating expenses (3) 28.7 67.0 48.8 234.8 Total operating expenses 1,205.7 1,234.9 2,404.2 2,573.8 OPERATING INCOME 683.9 546.0 1,298.8 948.9 OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE): Interest expense, TV Azteca — (3.4 ) — (0.7 ) Interest income 11.7 18.4 24.1 33.8 Interest expense (204.5 ) (207.9 ) (412.0 ) (407.5 ) Loss on retirement of long-term obligations (22.1 ) — (22.2 ) — Other (expense) income (including foreign currency (losses) gains of $(5.3), $(40.4), $14.8 and $(17.1), respectively) (5.1 ) (34.8 ) 16.8 (7.0 ) Total other expense (220.0 ) (227.7 ) (393.3 ) (381.4 ) INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAXES 463.9 318.3 905.5 567.5 Income tax (provision) benefit (4) (29.6 ) (3.9 ) (63.6 ) 27.2 NET INCOME 434.3 314.4 841.9 594.7 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (5.2 ) (7.7 ) (15.4 ) (2.8 ) NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION STOCKHOLDERS 429.1 306.7 826.5 591.9 Dividends on preferred stock — — — (9.4 ) NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION COMMON STOCKHOLDERS $ 429.1 $ 306.7 $ 826.5 $ 582.5 NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE AMOUNTS: Basic net income attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders $ 0.97 $ 0.69 $ 1.87 $ 1.33 Diluted net income attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders $ 0.96 $ 0.69 $ 1.86 $ 1.32 WEIGHTED AVERAGE COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING (in thousands): BASIC 442,203 441,497 441,778 438,328 DILUTED 445,337 444,362 445,040 441,513 _______________ (1) Property costs of operations, services costs of operations and selling, general, administrative and development expense include stock-based compensation expense in aggregate amounts of $21.9 million and $64.4 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, respectively, and $24.8 million and $67.5 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively.
