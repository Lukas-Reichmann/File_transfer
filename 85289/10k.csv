Business. Business Overview Innodata Inc. (NASDAQ: INOD) (including its subsidiaries, the “Company”, “Innodata”, “we”, “us” or “our”) is a leading data engineering company. Our mission is to help the world’s most prestigious companies deliver the promise of ethical, high-performing artificial intelligence (“AI”), which we believe will contribute to a safer and more prosperous world. Innodata was founded on a simple idea: engineer the highest quality data so organizations across broad industry segments could make smarter decisions. Today, we believe that we’re delivering the highest quality data for some of the world’s most innovative technology companies to use to train the AI models of the future. AI holds the promise that computers can perceive and understand the world, enabling products and services that would have been previously unimaginable and impossible with traditional coding. AI learns from data, and the highest-performing AI will have learned from the highest-quality data. We believe that we can contribute meaningfully by harnessing our capabilities, honed over 30 years, in collecting and annotating data at scale with consistency and high accuracy. We’re also helping companies deploy and integrate AI into their operations and products and providing innovative AI-enabled industry platforms, helping ensure that our customers’ businesses are prepared for a world in which machines augment human activity in ways previously unimaginable. Market Opportunities AI Data Preparation AI applications are trained with large quantities of data, unlike traditional computer applications that use languages such as Python and Java to tell computers what to do. AI applications learn from the data through a series of regressions. Today’s highest performing AI applications (such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT) would never have been possible to build through traditional programming. Data science teams at some of the largest technology companies are accelerating development of generative AI technologies that produce high quality text, code, and images in response to user prompts. At their core, they rely upon large language models (LLMs), which are deep neural networks (an artificial intelligence architecture) with billions of parameters and requiring massive amounts of training data to encode the essence of human language. They also require fine-tuning through supervised learning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to render them suitable for specialized tasks and domains, to control hallucinations (the tendency of these models to make up things on the fly), and to minimize the risk that they generate unsafe or biased results. In addition, companies across industry verticals are seeking to develop AI-based applications for an ever-increasing variety of use cases such as self-driving cars, surveillance systems, automated medical diagnostics, digital assistants, chatbots, content moderation, robotics, fraud detection and contract review. Developing high-quality training data is critical for the AI to perform correctly, but often requires technology and skilled human resources that data science teams lack. Moreover, developing high-quality data takes up 80% of the time for most AI and ML projects. 1 Data sciences teams seek partners that can perform these data preparation functions for them at large-scale and at high quality, while using automated tools to minimize cost. As AI projects become more specialized and mission-critical and data preparation becomes increasingly complex, data science teams seek partners with deep domain knowledge and an infrastructure in which data security is assured. ​ We believe that Innodata is ideally situated to partner with data science teams. ​ We collect or create training data, annotate training data, and train AI algorithms for social media companies, robotics companies, financial services companies, and many others, working with images, text, video and audio. We utilize a variety of leading third-party image and video annotation tools. For text, we use our proprietary data annotation platform that incorporates AI to reduce cost while improving consistency and quality of output. Our proprietary data annotation platform features auto-tagging capabilities that apply to both classical and generative AI tasks. Our platform encapsulates many of the innovations we have conceived of in the course of our 30-year history of creating high-quality data. 1 Data Preparation & Labeling for AI 2020 , Cognilytica Research (Jan. 31, 2020) ​ 4 Table of Contents In addition, because collecting real-world data is often impracticable (due to data privacy regulations or rarity of cohorts and outliers), we create high-quality synthetic data that maintains all of the statistical properties of real-world data, using a combination of domain specialists and machine technologies that leverage LLMs. We are presently working with or in pilots or advanced discussions with four of the five largest technology companies, and several of the world’s leading brands spanning multiple verticals, to enable, accelerate or enrich the services they deliver to end users around chatbot assistance, facial recognition, social networking, gaming, drones, medical diagnostics and robotics, to name a few. The AI data training market is estimated to have been $8.8 billion in 2022, projected to grow at a CAGR of 24% to reach $74.5 billion by 2032, 2 essentially proxying the enormous growth expected in AI system spending overall ($118 billion in 2022, $301 billion in 2026, a 26.5% CAGR). 3 Similarly, the global data annotation tools market was valued at $1 billion in 2021, projected to reach $10 billion by 2028, which is a CAGR of 30%. 4 AI Model Deployment and Integration We believe that over the next decade, almost all industries will be fundamentally reinvented through the advent of high-performing AI models. We help businesses leverage the latest AI technologies to achieve their goals. We develop custom AI models (where we select the appropriate algorithms, tune hyperparameters, train and validate the models, and update the models as required). We also help businesses fine-tune their own custom versions of our proprietary models and third-party foundation models (including LLMs) to address domain-specific and customer-specific use cases. 2 Data Labeling Solution and Services Market , FactMR (Feb. 2022) 3 Worldwide Artificial Intelligence Systems Spending Guide, IDC (Aug. 2022) 4 Data Annotation Tools Market, Global Market Insights , (Feb. 2022) ​ 5 Table of Contents The current pace of AI innovation is accelerating. The algorithms and techniques used today will likely be obsolete in the next several years. Therefore, we have built our solutions and platforms in such a way as to enable us to incorporate new open source or proprietary software innovations. Many of our customers provide products and solutions that require intensive text data processing and analytics. For these customers, in addition to deploying and integrating AI models, we often provide a range of data engineering support services including data transformation, data curation, data hygiene, data consolidation, data extraction, data compliance, and master data management. For many of our longest-tenured customers, we continuously innovate and deploy models into their workflows and digital operations. Our customers span a diverse range of industries and a wide range of AI use cases, benefiting from the short time-to-value and high economic returns our AI solutions and platforms offer. The document analytics market - a subset of the overall AI market - is expected to grow at a CAGR of 49.6% from $1.1 billion in 2021 to $8.15 billion by 2026. 5 Meanwhile, overall enterprise AI spend is projected to reach $102.9 billion by 2030, up from $16.8 billion in 2021, registering a CAGR of 47.2%. 6 AI-Enabled Industry Platforms Our AI-enabled industry platforms address specific, niche market requirements that we believe we can innovate with AI/ML technologies. We deploy these industry platforms as software-as-a-service (SaaS) and as managed services. These platforms benefit from our technology infrastructure, our industry-specific knowledge, our strong customer relationships and experience merging technology with the business processes of our customers. To date, we have built an industry platform for medical records data extraction and transformation (which we brand as “Synodex ® ”) and an industry platform for public relations (which we brand as “Agility PR Solutions”). We are in development with an additional AI-enabled industry platform to serve financial services institutions. Our Synodex industry platform transforms medical records into useable digital data organized in accordance with our proprietary data models or customer data models. At the end of 2022, we had 18 customers utilizing our Synodex platform, including John Hancock Insurance, the insurance operating unit of John Hancock Financial (a division of Manulife) and one of the largest life insurers in the United States. As we further integrate AI into the platform, we aim to address the needs of the healthcare sector, which is increasingly seeking to search, analyze, and interpret vast volumes of patient data, improve clinical documentation and make computer-assisted coding more efficient. The global artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare market is forecast to reach a market size of $102.7 billion by 2028, up from $14.6 billion in 2023, with a CAGR of 47.6%. 7 Our Agility industry platform provides marketing communications and public relations professionals with the ability to target and distribute content to journalists and social media influencers world-wide and to monitor and analyze global news (print, web, radio and TV) and social media. Agility is now ranked by software review site G2 Crowd as meeting the requirements of customers better than its two largest competitors that have combined revenues of over $1 billion. 8 Agility operates in the $5.5 billion media intelligence solutions market. 9 5 Document Analytics Global Market Report, Reportlinker Analytics (Sept. 2022) 6 Enterprise Artificial Intelligence (AI) Market, Precedence Research (Nov. 2022) 7 Artificial Intelligence In Healthcare Market, Markets and Markets Research Private Ltd.

Competitive Strengths Our Data Quality We believe we achieve industry-leading data quality by leveraging our technology, our large staff of human experts, and the culture we have cultivated over many years of providing high-quality data to the most demanding customers. For the past seven years, we have been designing and refining our approach for combining human experts and AI to produce large-scale, highly accurate data. In our approach, AI networks automatically perform much of the required processing and human experts perform processing that the AI cannot perform at a high level of confidence. The human output is fed back into the AI networks, which, as a result, “learn” and become “smarter” over time, achieving progressively greater levels of automation while maintaining the highest levels of quality. ( See “Our Technology”, below. ) Our 4,000+ experts have deep domain knowledge in a wide diversity of data domains. They are selected on the basis of data acumen, analytical ability, and deep domain proficiency. ( See “Our Global Delivery Framework”, below. ) Our culture of quality is critical to achieving and sustaining high data quality. Our culture has been cultivated over our decades of experience performing data-related tasks for leading global companies, including the four largest global information companies with which we have 10-plus year relationships building and maintaining many of their leading data products. We maintain independent quality assurance centers that comply with the ISO 9001:2008 quality management system standards. Our Global Delivery Framework We have over 4,000 employees and associates across 23 countries. Many of them have data domain expertise in various fields, including law, sciences, health, finance, and technology and hold advanced degrees. We also have access to a large population of “crowdsourced” workers that we maintain in our databases. Our delivery locations are strategically located to give us access to a diverse talent base spanning multiple time zones and more than 40 languages. We have also invested in building a proprietary resource management platform geared specifically to managing remote staff and freelancers. Prior to the global pandemic, our operating model was to almost exclusively use full-time employees working from large production centers. Propelled by the need to shift to remote working, we are presently approximately 75% cloud-based and remote, which has enabled us to lower fixed operating costs and achieve greater scalability. Our Technology Over the past seven years, we have built a technology infrastructure that automates complex data annotation and other data engineering tasks. Our technology infrastructure combines advanced dataflow, orchestration and cognitive processing, and purpose-built applications used by human experts, which we refer to as “workbenches”. This infrastructure enables us to perform data annotation and other data engineering tasks at progressively higher levels of efficiency without compromising quality as it continuously learns from human experts. Our workbenches incorporate data verification and validation algorithms to detect human expert inconsistencies and to catch difficult auto-annotation errors such as LLM hallucinations. Our proprietary, state-of-the-art Goldengate platform is our core AI technology stack. Goldengate ingests unstructured data and performs a series of cognitive tasks to extract intelligence and create analytical data that people can use for generating inferences and powering analytical applications. It serves up low-code AI with transfer learning, orchestrating generative LLMs we have developed over the past seven years of deploying industrial deep neural networks as well as third-party foundation models. It integrates both with our internal systems and customer environments through application programming interfaces (“APIs”). Goldengate serves as the foundational technology for the AI projects we perform for customers, as well as the AI-under-the-hood that powers our data annotation platform and our industry platforms. One of the main benefits of the platform is that it is “low-code”, so it does not require a large number of data scientists to build models or require a data science platform to orchestrate models and update models. Using Goldengate in combination with our SMEs, we are able to build high-performing, cutting-edge models that address real-world problems. In 2021 we further AI-enabled Synodex, Agility and our data annotation platform using Goldengate; in 2022, we commercialized it further as both a customer-facing technology and as the engine under other potential industry solutions. 7 Table of Contents To support our Agility industry platform, we have built a fully scalable, cloud-based infrastructure that powers a SaaS experience for global customers on a 24/7 basis. It includes (i) an AI/ML-powered big data media intelligence platform that indexes two billion media items per year, powering media monitoring, media enrichment, and media database APIs; (ii) a full targeting workflow platform that integrates media targeting, content curation, content distribution, integrated newswires, and a newsroom; (iii) a comprehensive database of more than one million global media influencers and journalists; (iv) a media monitoring and analytics engine; and (v) a workflow platform for media database research combining AI and machine learning to streamline research workflows for discovery and maintenance of our database. In January 2023, we released a module within our Agility product called PR CoPilot™ that augments the work communications professionals do to generate press releases and media outreach. It leverages proprietary Innodata technology and OpenAI’s GPT large language models. We believe PR CoPilot is the first AI writing assistant built natively into a fully-integrated PR platform. To support our Synodex industry platform, we have built technologies for transforming imaged medical records and HL7/FHIR electronic health records (EHR) systems into digital data conforming to proprietary insurance medical data dictionaries that span diseases and impairments, diagnostic tests, and pharmacology and support industry standard codes such as ICD-10 as well as rules engines for processing, analyzing and displaying the digital data. Our Infrastructure Our infrastructure supports a range of strategies to suit our customers’ requirements for data security, compliance, scalability and reliability. Our user endpoints are secured with cloud-managed security solutions consisting of firewall, IDS/IPS, vulnerability scanning and patch management engines. We host data and applications in our own data centers at our operations centers, in our customers’ data centers, and on third-party cloud services including Amazon Web Services (“AWS”), Microsoft Azure (“Azure”), Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (“OCI”), and Google Cloud Platform (“GCP”) that provide the benefit of “infinite scalability” of information technology resources. Our data operations are linked by multiple redundant network connections. Our Wide Area Network – along with our Local Area Networks, Storage Area Networks, Network Attached Storage and data centers – are configured with industry standard redundancy, often with more than one backup to establish 24x7 availability. In 2022, our Wide Area Network had 99.98% uptime excluding scheduled maintenance. We encrypt all sensitive information, both at rest and in transit, to the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 256 or similar standard, and we employ a range of security features, including industry-leading managed firewalls and intrusion detection and prevention services. ( See “Information Security”, below. ) Our Breadth of Capabilities We are able to address customers at their highest point of need. For example, we may provide data annotation for a data sciences team at a bank that is building an AI application to manage complex loan agreements. For another banking customer with the same requirement but without access to sophisticated data sciences support, we might provide a full AI/ML solution built on our proprietary Goldengate AI platform that extracts key data points from the loan agreements and outputs normalized digital data via an API to the bank’s existing application. For still another banking customer that also lacks an application to analyze and manage the data, we might provide a data analytics platform. Data science teams that utilize our data annotation services also often have other related needs that include data transformation, data curation, data hygiene, data consolidation, data compliance, and master data management. Unlike many of our data annotation competitors – that are essentially staffing companies – as a full-service data engineering company we are able to address these attendant requirements. Our Legacy We developed our capabilities and honed our approaches progressively over the last 30 years creating high-quality data for many of the world’s most demanding information companies. Approximately seven years ago, we formed Innodata Labs, a research and development center, to research, develop and apply machine learning and emerging AI to our large-scale, human-intensive data operations. In 2019, we began packaging the capabilities that emerged from our R&D efforts in order to align with several fast-growing new markets and help companies use AI/ML to drive performance benefits and business insights. Our historical core competency in high-quality data, combined with these R&D efforts in applied AI, created the foundation for the evolution of our offerings, which include AI Data Preparation, AI Model Deployment and Integration, and AI-Enabled Industry Platforms. 8 Table of Contents Our Culture We have developed a strong customer- and quality-centric culture over 30 years serving many of the world’s most successful companies that trust us with their data needs. We believe in communicating honestly, transparently and broadly. We are optimistic in the promise of technology to augmenting human initiative and talent. We embrace diversity (and began doing so long before it was in vogue). We prize empathy and respect in our relationships with customers and colleagues alike while at the same time honing direct communication that best promotes optimal business outcomes for our customers. We believe our culture helps us best serve our customers and helps us attract and retain top people. Growth Strategy We believe that we are living in a unique time – that AI will soon become the “brains” of our computers, our robots and our cars; and that AI will be adopted by thousands of enterprises to deliver services and products that would have been impossible with traditional coding. In AI, the software writes itself by learning from large amounts of data. Nowhere does the phrase “garbage in, garbage out” apply better. A data-centric approach for collection and annotation of consistent, high-quality data will separate the winners from the losers. Our strategy for growth is to leverage our 30+ year experience creating high quality data. We intend to align to and serve large, dynamic and rapidly growing markets related to the creation and commercialization of increasingly sophisticated AI and deployment of AI in businesses. Our solutions and platforms leverage the technology, human resources, and culture of fanaticism for data quality that we have developed over the past 30 years, as well as the AI/ML research and development we have invested in over the past seven years. Key elements of our growth strategy include: Driving New Customer Acquisition We believe we are still in the early stages of penetrating our addressable markets. We intend to pursue new long-term, strategic customer relationships, especially with customers with large and growing commitments to AI innovation, where we can deliver a wide range of our capabilities and have meaningful impact. Beginning in 2021, we substantially scaled our sales organization, most notably the sales organization supporting our Agility PR solutions product. In late 2021 and early 2022, we experienced challenges in retaining sales hires primarily in our Austin, Texas sales office. We have since closed that sales office, have focused on hiring and retaining sales talent in other locations and in building a data-driven sales organization. We believe that the current sales organization is operating well and will likely enable us to achieve our near-term growth targets. Expanding Relationships with Existing Customers We believe we have demonstrated a clear ability to “land-and-expand” within customer accounts. Once we engage with a customer within a specific line of business and specific use cases, and the customer experiences the benefits of working with us, it will often increase the number of use cases for which it engages us and expand to additional lines of business. Continuing to Develop New Capabilities We intend to develop new capabilities designed around emerging customer needs and advances in AI technologies. We intend to develop additional charter customer relationships, like the ongoing relationship we formed with one of the world’s largest banks to co-develop an AI-enabled compliance platform. Continuing to Innovate We believe that our ability to innovate will continue to be an important contributor to our growth and market traction. We work closely with our customers, assessing their requirements for enhancements to our existing capabilities and new capabilities with the goal of better serving them. We have well-defined roadmaps for our AI industry platforms to introduce new features and functions that we 9 Table of Contents believe will enable us to generate growth by broadening the appeal of our platforms to potential new customers as well as increasing the opportunities for further expansions with existing customers. We expect to fund these investments for growth from our internal resources and we may access capital through debt or equity financing. Our Customers Our customers include leading businesses across multiple verticals including banking, insurance, financial services, technology, digital retailing and information/media. One customer in the DDS segment generated approximately 11% of the Company’s total revenues in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. Another customer in the DDS segment generated approximately 11% of the Company’s total revenues in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of total revenues during these periods. Further, in the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, revenues from non-U.S. customers accounted for 38% and 45%, respectively, of the Company's revenues. We have long-standing relationships with many of our customers. Our track record of delivering high-quality services helps us to solidify customer relationships. Many of our customers are recurring customers, meaning that they have continued to provide additional projects to us after our initial engagement with them. Our agreements with our customers are in many cases terminable on 30 to 90 days’ notice. A substantial portion of the services we provide to our customers is subject to their requirements. Sales and Marketing We market and sell our solutions and platforms directly through our professional staff, senior management and direct sales personnel operating primarily from various locations in the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom and Europe. In addition, we are increasingly developing and expanding our use of strategic partnerships and channel relationships for the establishment and development of new and existing customers. In addition to our executive-level business development professionals and sales and marketing personnel, we also deploy solutions architects, technical support experts and consultants who support the development of new customers and new customer engagements. These resources work within teams (both permanent and ad hoc) that provide support to customers. Our marketing department and sales professionals work together to generate leads. Our sales professionals identify and qualify prospects, securing direct personal access to decision makers at existing and prospective customers. They facilitate interactions between customer personnel and our service teams to define ways in which we can assist customers with their goals. For each prospective customer engagement, we assemble a team of our senior employees drawn from various disciplines within our Company. The team members assume assigned roles in a formalized process, using their combined knowledge and experience to understand the customer’s goals and collaborate with the customer on a solution. Our marketing organization is responsible for developing and increasing the visibility and awareness of our brand and our service offerings, defining and communicating our value proposition, generating qualified, early-stage leads and furnishing effective sales support tools. As part of our marketing strategy, we partner with media organizations to build awareness, establish a reputation as an industry thought leader and generate leads. Media partners include trade associations and publications, trade show producers and consulting organizations. These partnerships are particularly valuable in enterprise industries as we build our presence among digital content leaders and decision makers. Primary marketing outreach activities include content marketing, event marketing (including exhibiting at trade shows, virtual summits, conferences and seminars), direct and database marketing, public and media relations (including speaking engagements), and web marketing (including integrated marketing campaigns, search engine optimization, search engine marketing and the maintenance and continued development of external websites). 10 Table of Contents Sales activities include lead generation, nurturing leads, engaging in discussions with prospective customers to understand their needs, demonstrating our products, designing solutions, responding to requests for proposals, and managing account and customer relationships and activities. Personnel from our solutions analysis group, our customer services group and our engineering services group closely support our direct sales effort. These individuals assist the sales force in understanding the technical needs of customers and providing responses to these needs, including demonstrations, prototypes, pricing quotations and time estimates. In addition, account managers from our customer service group support our direct sales effort by providing ongoing project-level support to our customers. Competition Major competitors across industry verticals include Amazon Sagemaker Ground Truth, Appen, CloudFactory, Defined Crowd, Deepen.ai, Telus, Samasource, and Scale AI, several of which are large firms with established customer bases, as well as technology service providers such as Cognizant Technology Solutions, ExlService Holdings, Inc., Genpact Limited, Infosys, and Tata Consultancy Services. We compete by offering high-quality, competitively-priced solutions that leverage our technical platforms, IT infrastructure, offshore domain experts and economies of scale. Our competitive advantages are especially attractive to customers for undertakings that are complex, mission-critical, sizable in scope or scale, or that require high levels of information security. Each of our industry platforms has its discrete set of competitors. Major competitors for our Synodex industry platform are Risk Righter, eNoah, Parameds, Aosta and a few BPO companies, several of which are large firms with established customer bases. We also compete with in-house personnel at existing or prospective customers who may attempt to duplicate our services in-house or use alternative approaches to fulfill their needs. Our Agility industry platform competes with Meltwater, Cision, Kantar, and Intrado, several of which are large firms with established customer bases, as well as PR firms that provide media monitoring and analysis services and journalist and influencer databases. Our competitors also include social media listening companies and start-ups offering platforms to amplify messages by targeting social media influencers. Intellectual Property We depend, in part, upon our proprietary technologies and methodologies, including our Goldengate AI platform, various applications of our platforms, our proprietary data models and other intellectual property rights. We have a patent and several patent applications pending and believe that the duration of these patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of their applications. We rely on a combination of trade secret, license, nondisclosure and other contractual agreements and copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights. We enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, contractors and customers, and limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information and that of our customers. We cannot assure that these arrangements will be adequate to deter misappropriation of our proprietary information or that we will be able to detect unauthorized use and take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights. Information Security Our operations facilities in Asia and our data centers are certified to information security management standard - ISO27001:2013. We have deployed multi-layered security consisting of a wide range of security controls and measures such as two-factor authentication, patch management, full disk encryption system, anti-virus with firewall and IDS/IPS capability, redundant next generation firewalls with intrusion detection and prevention feature sets, and we utilize appropriately certified cloud resources. When we are processing personally identifiable information covered by HIPAA, we utilize U.S.-based, co-located data centers or HIPAA compliant cloud computing services with advanced data encryption (AES 256 or comparable) applied to data at rest and in motion. Government Regulation We are subject to a number of U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations that relate to our business, including those governing privacy and data protection. We comply with the requirements of the United States Health Insurance Portability and 11 Table of Contents Accountability Act of 1996 as amended (including by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Data (HITECH)) (HIPAA), the United Kingdom’s General Data Protection Regulation as tailored by the Data Protection Act 2018, the EU General Data Protection Regulation, and local laws regulating data privacy, as applicable. Research and Development Our Innodata Labs researches and develops AI-based technologies that we utilize in our operations and with our customers. The Innodata Labs team is comprised of data scientists, including data scientists who have published leading papers on discrete topics in data science and have earned PhD degrees in fields such as data entity extraction. Our product engineering teams also engage in research and development efforts focused on enhancing the functionality and utility of our AI industry platforms, addressing new use cases and developing additional innovative technologies. Timely development of new functionality to support existing and new use cases is essential to maintaining our competitive position, and we release new versions of our software on a regular basis. Customer feedback enables us to ensure that we stay aligned to our customers’ priorities and that we stay ahead of market needs. Our culture of innovation helps us attract and retain a highly motivated and talented team of AI experts and technologists. Our research and development center spans several geographical locations across North America and Asia-Pacific. In mid-2022, we formed an Advisory Board dedicated to helping drive growth through innovation initiatives and advancing dialogue related to ethical AI and the future of AI technologies. The advisory board is currently comprised by a Chief Data Officer for Microsoft and the director of University of Michigan’s Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. We are presently seeking additional members. Environmental, Social, and Governance We have built a robust corporate ESG program focused on social responsibility; improving how we perform as a steward of the environment; and sustainability. Social Responsibility We are driven by the vision of ushering in an era of broadly distributed, sustainable prosperity that can result from ethical AI and broad access to the benefits of AI. We have two programs underway designed to help ensure a future level playing field for marginalized or economically-disadvantaged communities that might otherwise be at a disadvantage in an increasingly AI-driven world. The first of these programs is our i-Hope Program. The aim of our i-Hope Program is to provide the gift of computer literacy to 25,000 children by 2025. From 2016 to 2022, our employees contributed over 2,300 person days to the program, building 17 fully-functional computer labs and smart classrooms across India, the Philippines, and Sri Lanka. As a result, we believe approximately 10,300 children in these communities are now more technology proficient and better prepared to participate in opportunities that AI presents. Our efforts have been well-recognized. In 2022, we (through our operating subsidiaries) received the 2022 CSR Company of the Year Excellence Award at the Asia CEO Awards-2022 and the 2021 Salamat Po Award from the Philippines Department of Social Welfare & Development . ​ 12 Table of Contents The second program is our i-Matter Program. It involves assisting leading technology companies in their efforts to ensure that facial recognition technologies of the future perform equally well across ethnic and gender identities. As a Forbes article explained, “Suppose the data used to train your AI system doesn’t have sufficient data about specific classes of individuals. In that case, it may not learn what to do when it encounters those individuals. Would a facial recognition system used for check-in to a hotel recognize a person with freckles? If the system stops working and makes check-in harder for a person with freckles, what should the company do? How does the company address this ethical dilemma?” 10 Our global efforts at AI inclusivity span nations, geographies, gender identities, etc., with a focus on minority communities and identity groups. For example, we recently began working with Native American tribes to ensure that they are in no respect disadvantaged by next generation facial recognition systems. Environmental Stewardship We are also committed to conducting our business in a manner that manages environmental issues responsibly and contributes to global efforts to curb carbon emissions. We fulfill this commitment by our efforts to conduct operations in an environmentally-sound manner; to manage our supply chains toward appropriate environmental practices; and sponsor grass-roots efforts designed to preserve the environment in the communities in which we operate. We have set metrics to monitor and target the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, energy usage, and water usage. We believe that this transparency and reporting has enabled us to improve our sustainability program continuously. We track and share with customers our emissions data for scopes 1, 2, and 3. Across all our global operations, we recycle e-waste and paper. In India, the Philippines, and Sri Lanka, we have planted over 1,100 saplings in nature reserves in 2022 and in Q1 2023 we aim to increase this to 4,400 saplings. Our program has practices in place to ensure that the trees will receive proper care and attention during their initial growth phase, which is crucial for their survival. Sustainability Our sustainability program is based on the following core elements: health and safety, business continuity management, information security, labor standards, anti-bribery and corruption, and management engagement and social impact. Our sustainability program is backed by ISO 27001:2013 (information security) certification, policies, and employee training for these core areas. Employees As of December 31, 2022, we employed 4,209 employees, 4,205 of which are full-time, with 181 persons in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, and 4,028 persons in the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka, Canada, Germany, and Israel . Many of our employees hold advanced degrees in specialized fields such as law, business, technology, medicine, and social sciences. No employees are currently represented by a labor union, and we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory. Corporate Offices Our principal executive offices are located at 55 Challenger Road, Ridgefield Park, New Jersey 07660, just outside New York City, and our telephone number is (201) 371-8000. We were founded in 1988. Our website is www.innodata.com ; information contained on our website is not included as a part of, or incorporated by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K. There we make available, free of charge, our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file that material with, or furnish it to, the SEC. Our SEC reports can be obtained through the Investor Relations section of our website or from the Securities and Exchange Commission at www.sec.gov . 10 https://www.forbes.com/sites/glenngow/2021/07/11/google-facebook-and-microsoft-are-working-on-ai-ethics-heres-what-your-company-should-be-doing/ ​ 13 Table of Contents Item 1A. Risk Factors. The risk factors set forth below describe what the Company believes to be the material factors, risks, and uncertainties related to our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The risks and uncertainties set forth below, as well as other factors described elsewhere in this Form 10-K or in other filings by the Company with the SEC, could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to the Company or that are not currently believed by the Company to be material may also harm the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. Risks Related to Our Business and Operations We have historically relied on a limited number of customers that have accounted for a significant portion of our revenues, and our results of operations could be adversely affected if we were to lose one or more of these significant customers. We have historically relied on a limited number of customers that have accounted for a significant portion of our revenues. One customer in the DDS segment generated approximately 11% of the Company’s total revenues in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. Another customer in the DDS segment generated approximately 11% of the Company’s total revenues in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of total revenues during these periods. Further, in the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, revenues from non-U.S. customers accounted for 38% and 45%, respectively, of the Company’s revenues. We may lose one or more of these customers, or our other major customers, as a result of our failure to meet or satisfy our customer’s requirements, the completion or termination of a project or engagement, or the customer’s selection of another service provider. In addition, the volume of work performed for our major customers may vary from year to year, and services they require from us may change from year to year. They may also request that we modify certain key terms of our agreements with them as a condition of continuing to do business with us. If the volume of work performed for our major customers varies, if the services they require from us change, or if they require price concessions, our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected, and we may incur a loss from operations. If certain key terms of our agreements with our major customers are modified, our revenues and results of operations may be adversely affected. Our services are typically subject to customer requirements, and in many cases are terminable upon 30 to 90 days’ notice. The loss of these customers or a significant variation in the volume of work performed for these customers may have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition and results of operations. A portion of our services is provided on a non-recurring basis for specific projects, and our inability to replace large projects when they are completed or otherwise terminated has adversely affected, and could in the future adversely affect, our revenues and results of operations. We provide a portion of our services for specific projects that generate revenues that terminate on completion of a defined task. While we seek, whenever possible, on completion or termination of large projects, to counterbalance periodic declines in revenues with new arrangements to provide services to the same customer or others, our inability to obtain sufficient new projects to counterbalance any decreases in such work may adversely affect our future revenues and results of operations. New acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic investments or partnerships could harm our operating results. We may pursue acquisitions, joint ventures or engage in strategic investments or partnerships to grow and enhance our capabilities. There can be no assurance that we will successfully consummate any acquisitions or joint ventures, or realize profit from strategic investments, or achieve desired financial and operating results. Further, such activities involve a number of risks and challenges, including proper evaluation, diversion of management’s attention and proper integration with our current business. Accordingly, we might fail to realize the expected benefits or strategic objectives of any such venture we undertake. If we are unable to complete the kind of acquisitions for which we plan, we may not be able to achieve our planned rates of growth, profitability or competitive position in specific markets or services. Our new customers may sunset their products because of lack of sufficient revenues or declining revenues, or a change in their business direction, and this may result in termination of our work for these customers. As we obtain new opportunities and win new business, our customers may not generate the level of revenues that we initially anticipated at the time of signing a contract with them. Our customers may experience declining revenues with their existing products, or may change their business direction. This could be due to various reasons beyond our or their control, and it could lead to termination of projects or contracts. As we normally invest in people and technology and incur other costs in anticipation of revenues, any such deviation from our expected plan or anticipated results could impact our margins and earnings. 14 Table of Contents Our success is dependent on our ability to successfully develop new services, platforms and solutions and enhance our existing services, platforms and solutions, and market acceptance of these offerings. Our success is also dependent on our ability to compete with new vendors with lean cost and flexible cost models. The information technology and artificial intelligence (AI) industries are characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, changing customer preferences, new product and service introductions and the emergence of new vendors with lean cost and flexible cost models. Our future success will depend on our ability to successfully develop services, platforms and solutions that keep pace with changes in our addressable markets, and the acceptance of these services, platforms and solutions by our existing and target customers. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in developing new services, platforms and solutions, addressing evolving technologies on a timely or cost-effective basis or, if these services, platforms and solutions are developed, that we will be successful in the marketplace. We also cannot guarantee that we will be able to compete effectively with new vendors offering lean cost and flexible cost models, or that products, services or technologies developed by others will not render our services, platforms and solutions non-competitive or obsolete. Our failure to address these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We operate in highly competitive markets. While we invest in developing and pursuing new services, platforms and solutions, our profitability could be reduced if these services, platforms and solutions do not yield the profit margins we expect, or if the new offerings do not generate the planned revenues. The markets for our services, platforms and solutions are highly competitive. Some of our competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, human, technical and other resources and greater name recognition than we do. There are relatively few barriers preventing companies from entering the markets in which we operate. As a result, new market entrants also pose a threat to our business. We also compete with in-house personnel at current and prospective customers who may attempt to duplicate our offerings using their own personnel. We have made and continue to make significant investments towards building-out new capabilities to pursue growth. These investments increase our costs, and if these new capabilities do not yield the revenues or profit margins we expect, and we are unable to grow our business and revenue proportionately, our profitability may be reduced, or we may incur losses. If we are not able to compete effectively in the markets we serve or if we are not able to successfully develop new services, platforms and solutions, our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected. We depend on third-party technology in the provision of our services. We rely upon certain software that we license from third parties, including software integrated with our internally developed software used in the provision of our services. These third-party software licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable or competitive terms, if at all. The loss of, or inability to maintain or obtain any of these software licenses, could result in delays in the provision of our services until we develop, identify, license and integrate equivalent software. Any delay in the provision of our services could damage our business and adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, our Company utilizes third party data centers to serve our customers and generate revenue. Any disruption in the provision of services from these data centers could result in loss of revenue, customer dissatisfaction and loss of customers. Our Agility segment relies on third parties to provide certain content and data for our solutions. The cessation by third parties to provide their content has adversely affected, and could in the future adversely affect, our revenue and results of operations. Our Agility segment relies on third parties to provide or make available certain data for our information databases and our news and social media monitoring service. These third parties, in the past, have restricted access to certain content and may not renew agreements to provide content to us or may increase the price they charge for their content. Additionally, the quality of the content provided to us may not be acceptable to us and we may need to enter into agreements with additional third parties. In the event we are unable to use or have access to such third-party content or are unable to enter into agreements with new third parties, current customers may discontinue their relationship with us, and it may be difficult to acquire new customers. 15 Table of Contents Our businesses are reliant on key employees, and we may face high attrition in our talent. We may not be able to replace displaced talent with new talent on a timely basis or with equivalent skill sets. We are, to a considerable degree, reliant on the continuing leadership of our Chief Executive Officer and would be materially and adversely affected should he unexpectedly cease to be employed by us. In addition, our businesses are subject to fierce competition for talent, which could result in high attrition of our employees, or we may not be able to find the requisite talent to operate our businesses. A significant increase in the attrition rate among employees with specialized skills could decrease our operating efficiency and productivity. Our failure to attract, train and retain personnel with the qualifications necessary to fulfill the needs of our existing and future customers or to assimilate new employees successfully could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, fluctuations in our business may require that we lay off employees with possible negative effects on employee morale. We try to minimize these risks by actively promoting employee relationships and offering competitive salaries, but if we cannot mitigate these risks, our business and our operating performance could be adversely affected. We operate from multiple locations and our employees are very diverse, so we have significant coordination risks. We are headquartered in Ridgefield Park, New Jersey, just outside New York City. We have delivery centers in the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka, Canada, the United Kingdom, Israel, and Germany. Our employees are geographically dispersed, as well as culturally diverse. Our personnel need to work together to successfully execute our business plans and we invest in various measures to improve coordination and teamwork. Should we fail in these efforts, our ability to execute our business plans may be adversely affected. Our intellectual property rights are valuable and if we are unable to protect them or are subject to intellectual property rights claims, our business may be harmed. Our intellectual property rights include certain trademarks, trade secrets, domain name registrations, a patent and patent applications. Although we take precautions to protect our intellectual property rights, these efforts may not be sufficient or effective. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, we may experience difficulties in achieving and maintaining brand recognition. Disruptions in telecommunications, system failures, data corruption or virus attacks could harm our ability to execute our global resource model, which could result in customer dissatisfaction and a reduction of our revenues. We use a distributed global resource model. Our North American workforce provides services from the U.S. and Canada, and the balance of our workforce provides services from the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka, the United Kingdom, Israel and Germany. Our global facilities are linked with a telecommunications network that uses multiple service providers. We may not be able to maintain active voice and data communications between our various facilities and our customers’ sites at all times due to disruptions in these networks, system failures, data corruption or virus attacks. Any significant failure in our ability to communicate, or the availability of our platforms, could result in a disruption in our business, which could hinder our performance, or our ability to complete customer projects on time, or provide services to our customers. This, in turn, could lead to customer dissatisfaction and an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Even though we have implemented network security measures, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to computer viruses, cyber-attacks, break-ins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering or intentional and unintentional disclosure of sensitive and /or confidential personal information by employees and non-employees. Additionally, the Company may not be able to effectively identify and resolve such issues on a timely basis. The occurrence of any of the events described above could result in interruptions, delays, the loss or corruption of data, cessations in the availability of systems or liability under privacy laws or contracts, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. Our international operations subject us to risks inherent in doing business on an international level, any of which could increase our costs and hinder our growth. The major part of our operations is carried on in the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka, Canada, the United Kingdom, Israel, and Germany, while our headquarters are in the U.S., and our customers are primarily located in North America and Europe. While we do not depend on significant revenues from sources internal to the Asian countries in which we operate, we are nevertheless subject to certain adverse economic factors relating to overseas economies generally, including inflation, external debt, a negative balance of trade and underemployment. In certain of the countries in which we operate, tax authorities have exercised, and may continue to exercise, significant discretionary and arbitrary powers to make tax demands or decline to refund payments that may be due to us as per tax returns. Other risks associated with our international business activities include: 16 Table of Contents One or more of these factors could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Political uncertainty, political unrest, terrorism, and natural calamities in the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka and Israel could adversely affect business conditions in those countries, which in turn could disrupt our business and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. Our operations located in the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka and Israel are in countries that remain vulnerable to disruptions from political uncertainty, political unrest, terrorist acts, and natural calamities. Any damage to our network and/or information systems would damage our ability to provide services, in whole or in part, and/or otherwise damage our operations and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Further, political tensions and escalation of hostilities in any of these countries could adversely affect our operations in these countries and therefore adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. Our global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises. We use a distributed global resource model, which exposes us to risks associated with public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics. A public health crisis in one or more of the geographic areas in which we operate could affect our ability to provide services to our customers and adversely affect our results of operations. The continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 17 Table of Contents The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (“COVID-19”), which the World Health Organization declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020, continues to spread throughout the world. COVID-19 has created significant global economic downturn, disrupted global trade and supply chains, adversely impacted many industries, and contributed to significant volatility in financial markets. In response to COVID-19, countries and local governments have at times imposed restrictions on the operations of non-essential businesses and services, imposed travel restrictions and implemented societal lockdowns. Additionally, companies have at times taken precautions, such as requiring employees to work remotely and temporarily closing businesses. All of these factors have had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on global economic conditions, underemployment and unemployment, consumer spending and reductions in non-essential spending by governments and private companies, as well as uncertainty in financial markets. We have experienced limited operational disruptions and declines in customer demand for services to date as a result of COVID-19; however, depending upon the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the introduction of new COVID-19 variants or the spread of existing COVID-19 variants, we may experience a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition as a result of the effects of COVID-19. Terrorist attacks or a war could adversely affect our results of operations. Terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war could affect us or our customers by disrupting normal business practices for extended periods of time and reducing business confidence. In addition, acts of violence or war may make travel more difficult and may effectively curtail our ability to serve our customers’ needs, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations. We may face various risks associated with shareholder activists or shareholder demands for better performance . There is no assurance that we will not be subject to shareholder activism or demands. Such activities could interfere with our ability to execute our strategic plan, be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations, and divert the attention of management and our employees. We are the subject of continuing litigation, including litigation by certain of our former employees. In 2008, a judgment was rendered in the Philippines against a Philippine subsidiary of the Company that is no longer active and purportedly also against Innodata Inc., in favor of certain former employees of the Philippine subsidiary. The potential payment amount aggregates to approximately $5.9 million, plus legal interest that accrued at 12% per annum from August 13, 2008 to June 30, 2013, and thereafter accrued and continues to accrue at 6% per annum. The potential payment amount as expressed in U.S. dollars varies with the Philippine peso to U.S. dollar exchange rate. In December 2017, a group of 97 of the former employees of the Philippine subsidiary indicated that they proposed to record the judgment as to themselves in New Jersey. In January 2018, in response to an action initiated by Innodata Inc., the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey (“USDC”) entered a preliminary injunction that enjoins these former employees from pursuing or seeking recognition or enforcement of the judgment against Innodata Inc. in the U.S. during the pendency of the action and until further order of the USDC. In June 2018, the USDC entered a consent order administratively closing the action subject to return of the action to the active docket upon the written request of Innodata Inc. or the former employees, with the USDC retaining jurisdiction over the matter and the preliminary injunction remaining in full force and effect. The principal relevant cases in the Philippines are Court of Appeals Case Nos. CA-G.R. SP No. 93295 Innodata Employees Association (IDEA), Eleanor Tolentino, et al. vs. Innodata Philippines, Inc., et al., and CA-G.R. SP No. 90538 Innodata Philippines, Inc. vs. Honorable Acting Secretary Manuel G. Imson, et al. (28 June 2007), the Department of Labor and Employment National Labor Relations Commission, Republic of the Philippines (NLRC-NCR-Case No.07-04713-2002, et al., Innodata Employees Association (IDEA) and Eleanor A. Tolentino, et al. vs. Innodata Philippines, Inc., et al), and the Department of Labor and Employment Office of the Secretary of Labor and Employment, Republic of the Philippines (Case No. OS-AJ-0015-2001, In Re: Labor Dispute at Innodata Philippines, Inc.). The U.S. District Court action is Civil Action No.: 2:17-cv-13268-SDW-LDW Innodata Inc. v. Myrna C. Augustin-Simon; et al. We are also subject to various other legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. While we believe that we have adequate reserves for those losses that we believe are probable and can be reasonably estimated, the ultimate results of legal proceedings and claims cannot be predicted with certainty. While we currently believe that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or overall trends in our consolidated results of operations, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties. Substantial recovery against us in the above- referenced Philippines action could have a material adverse impact on us, and unfavorable rulings or recoveries in the other proceedings could have a material adverse impact on the consolidated operating results of the period in which the ruling or recovery occurs. In addition, our estimate of potential impact on our consolidated financial position or overall consolidated results of operations for the above referenced legal proceedings could change in the future. See “Legal Proceedings”. 18 Table of Contents Our reputation could be damaged, or our profitability could suffer if we do not meet the controls and procedures in respect of the services, platforms and solutions we provide to our customers, or if we contribute to our customers’ internal control deficiencies. Our customers may perform audits or require us to perform audits, provide audit reports or obtain certifications with respect to the controls and procedures that we use in the performance of services for such customers, especially when we process data or information belonging to them. Our ability to acquire new customers and retain existing customers may be adversely affected and our reputation could be harmed if we receive a qualified opinion, or if we cannot obtain an appropriate certification or opinion with respect to our controls and procedures in connection with any such audit in a timely manner. Additionally, our profitability could suffer if our controls and procedures were to fail or to impair our customer’s ability to comply with its own internal control requirements. In the past, we have determined that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. If we determine again in the future that our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective, it is possible that our disclosure controls and procedures will not prevent or detect all errors and all instances of fraud. The ineffective disclosure controls and procedures could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and have a negative effect on the market prices for our common stock. We are required to maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that material information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that the information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We performed an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022 and concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2022. However, we previously performed this evaluation and concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2021. If we determine again in the future that we have ineffective disclosure controls and procedures, this could restrict our ability to access the capital markets, require significant resources to correct, subject us to fines, penalties or judgments, harm our reputation or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence and cause a decline in the market price of our common stock. Risks Related to Our Contracts A portion of our revenue is generated from projects that we characterize as recurring in nature. Projects that we characterize as recurring are nevertheless subject to termination. Our operating performance is materially dependent on the continuation of these projects. However, we are exposed to the risks that these projects may not be renewed by our customers or they could be terminated by our customers and we may not be able to replace these terminated projects with new recurring projects with similar profitability or customers may ask for a price reduction, which could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations. Our solutions for the Agility segment are sold pursuant to subscription agreements, and if subscription customers elect either not to renew these agreements, or to renew these agreements for less expensive services, our revenues and results of operations will be adversely affected. Our Agility segment derives its revenues primarily from subscription arrangements. Our customers may choose not to renew subscription agreements when they expire or may renew them at lower prices or for a significantly narrower scope of work. If large numbers of existing subscription customers do not renew these agreements or renew these agreements on terms less favorable to us, and if we cannot replace or supplement those non-renewals with new subscription agreements generating the same or greater levels of revenue, our revenues and results of operations will be adversely affected. 19 Table of Contents If our customers are not satisfied with our services, they may terminate our contracts with them or our services and we may suffer reputational damage, which could have an adverse impact on our business. Our business model depends in large part on our ability to attract additional work from our base of existing customers. Our business model also depends on relationships our account teams develop with our customers so that we can understand our customers’ needs and deliver solutions and services that are tailored to those needs. If a customer is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us, or with the type of services or solutions delivered, then we could incur additional costs to address the situation, the profitability of that work might be impaired, and the customer’s dissatisfaction with our services could damage our ability to obtain additional work from that customer. In particular, customers that are not satisfied might seek to terminate existing contracts, which could mean that we could incur costs for the services performed with no associated revenue upon termination of a contract. This could also direct future business to our competitors. In addition, negative publicity related to our customer services or relationships, regardless of its accuracy, may further damage our business by affecting our reputation and our ability to compete for new contracts with current and prospective customers. Risks Related to Financial Performance or General Economic Conditions We have no bank facilities or line of credit. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash flows from operations will provide sufficient sources of liquidity to satisfy our financial needs for the next 12 months. However, we have no bank facilities or lines of credit, and reductions in our cash and cash equivalents from operating losses, capital expenditures, adverse legal decisions, acquisitions or other events affecting our access to capital could materially and adversely affect the Company. See “Management Discussion and Analysis - Liquidity and Capital Resources” for additional information. A large portion of our accounts receivable is payable by a limited number of customers; the inability of any of these customers to pay its obligations could adversely affect our results of operations. Several significant customers account for a large percentage of our accounts receivable. If any of these customers were unable, or refused, for any reason, to pay our accounts receivable, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. As of December 31, 2022, 50% or $4.7 million, of our accounts receivable was due from five customers. In addition, we evaluate the financial condition of our customers prior to extending credit to them. We maintain specific allowances against doubtful receivables. Actual losses on customer balances could differ from those that we currently anticipate and, as a result, we might need to adjust our allowances. There is no guarantee that we will accurately assess the creditworthiness of our customers. Macroeconomic conditions could also result in financial difficulties, including limited access to the credit markets, insolvency or bankruptcy, for our customers, and, as a result, could cause customers to delay payments to us, request modifications to their payment arrangements that could increase our receivables balance, or default on their payment obligations to us. If we are unable to timely collect from our customers, our cash flows could be adversely affected. Quarterly fluctuations in our revenues and results of operations could make financial forecasting difficult and could negatively affect our stock price. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, significant fluctuations in our quarterly revenues and results of operations. During the past eight quarters, our net income (loss) ranged from income of approximately $0.4 million in the first quarter of 2021 to a loss of approximately $3.8 million in the second quarter of 2022. We experience fluctuations in our revenue and results of operations as we replace and begin new projects, which may have some normal start-up delays, or we may be unable to replace a project entirely or on terms that are as attractive to us as the project that is being replaced. These and other factors may contribute to fluctuations in our results of operations from quarter to quarter. A high percentage of our operating expenses, particularly personnel and rent, are relatively fixed in advance of any particular quarter. As a result, unanticipated variations in the number and timing of our projects, or in employee wage levels and utilization rates, may cause us to significantly underutilize our production capacity and employees, resulting in significant variations in our operating results in any particular quarter, and have resulted in losses. 20 Table of Contents Weakness in the global economy, and in particular in the United States, Europe and the United Kingdom, could negatively impact our revenue and operating results. The United States, Europe, the United Kingdom and other economies may suffer from uncertainty, volatility, disruption, and other adverse conditions, such as inflation, and these conditions have adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact the business community and the financial markets. Adverse economic and financial market conditions may negatively affect our customers and our markets, thereby negatively impacting our revenue and operating results. For example, weak market conditions have extended, and could continue to extend, the length of our sales cycle and cause potential customers to delay, defer, or decline to make purchases of our services, platforms, and solutions due to uncertainties surrounding the future performance of their businesses, limitations on their expenditures due to internal budget constraints, and the adverse effects of the economy on their business and financial condition. As a result, if economic and financial market conditions weaken or deteriorate, then our revenue and operating results, including our ability to grow and expand our business and operations, could be materially and adversely affected. Pricing pressures could negatively impact our revenues and operating results. Due to the intense competition involved in outsourcing and information technology services, we generally face pricing pressures from our customers due to competition from other companies in our markets. Our ability to maintain or increase pricing is restricted as customers generally expect to receive volume discounts or special pricing incentives as we do more business with them; moreover, our large customers may exercise pressure for discounts outside of agreed terms. Our profitability could suffer if we are not able to maintain pricing on our existing projects and win new projects at appropriate margins. If our pricing structures do not accurately anticipate the cost and complexity of performing our services and providing our platforms and solutions, then our contracts could be unprofitable. Our profit margin, and therefore our profitability, is dependent on the rates we are able to charge for our services, platforms and solutions measured against the costs of providing the service, platform or solution. If we are not able to maintain pricing on our existing services, platforms and solutions and win new projects at profitable margins, or if we underestimate the costs or complexities of new projects and incur losses, our profitability could suffer. The amounts we are able to recover for our services, platforms and solutions are affected by a number of factors, including competition, volume fluctuations, productivity of employees and processes, the value our customer derives from our services, platforms and solutions and general economic and political conditions. Furthermore, we provide services and solutions either on a time-and-materials basis or on a fixed-price basis. Our pricing is highly dependent on our internal forecasts and predictions about our projects, which might be based on limited data and could turn out to be inaccurate. If we do not accurately estimate the costs and timing for completing projects, our contracts could prove unprofitable for us or yield lower profit margins than anticipated. We may not be able to obtain price or volume increases that are necessary to offset the effect of wage inflation and other government mandated cost increases. We have experienced wage inflation and other government mandated cost increases in the Asian countries where we have the majority of our operations. In addition, we may experience adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. These global events have put pressure on our profitability and our margins. Although we have tried to partially offset wage increases, foreign currency fluctuations and other such increases through price increases and improving our efficiency, we cannot ensure that we will be able to continue to do so in the future, which could negatively impact our results of operations. Our international operations subject us to currency exchange fluctuations, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Although most of our revenues are denominated in U.S. dollars, a significant portion of our revenues are denominated in Canadian dollars, Pound Sterling and Euros. In addition, a significant portion of our expenses, primarily labor expenses in the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka, Germany, Canada, the United Kingdom and Israel, are incurred in the local currencies of the countries in which we operate. For financial reporting purposes, we translate all non-U.S. denominated transactions into U.S. dollars in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP). Fluctuations in the value of these currencies relative to the U.S. dollar have in the past and could in the future continue to have a direct impact on our revenues and our results of operations. The Philippines, India and Sri Lanka have, at times, experienced high rates of inflation, as well as major fluctuations in the exchange rate between such foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar. We are also subject to fluctuations in exchange rates that affect the value of funds held by our foreign subsidiaries. 21 Table of Contents Although we selectively undertake hedging activities to mitigate certain of these risks, our hedging activities may not be effective and may result in losses. See Note 14, “Derivatives,” to the consolidated financial statements. In the event that the governments of India or the Philippines or the government of another country changes its tax policies, rules and regulations, our tax expense may increase and affect our effective tax rates. We are subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. We are subject to the continual examination by tax authorities in India and in the Philippines, and we assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits could be materially different from what is reflected in historical income tax and indirect tax provisions and accruals, and could result in a material effect on our income tax provision, indirect tax expenses, net income or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made. If additional taxes are assessed, it could have an adverse impact on our financial results. In addition, changes in the tax rates, tax laws or the interpretation of tax laws in the jurisdictions where we operate, could affect our future results of operations. In September 2015, the Company’s Indian subsidiary was subject to an inquiry by the Service Tax Department in India regarding the classification of services provided by this subsidiary, asserting that the services provided by this subsidiary fall under the category of online information and database access or retrieval services (“OID Services”), and not under the category of business support services (“BS Services”) that are exempt from service tax as historically indicated in the subsidiary’s service tax filings. Our management disagrees with the Service Tax Department’s position. In November 2019, the Commissioner of Central Tax, GST & Central Excise issued an order confirming the Service Tax Department’s position. The Company is contesting this order in an appeal to the Customs, Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal. In the event the Service Tax Department is ultimately successful in proving that the services fall under the category of OID Services, the revenues earned by the Company’s Indian subsidiary for the period July 2012 through November 2016 would be subject to a service tax of between 12.36% and 15%, and this subsidiary may also be liable to pay interest and penalties. The revenue of our Indian subsidiary during this period was approximately $57.0 million. In accordance with new rules promulgated by the Service Tax Department, as of December 1, 2016 service tax is no longer applicable to OID or BS Services. Based on the Company’s assessment, in consultation with our tax counsel, the Company has not recorded any tax liability for this case. In a separate action relating to service tax refunds, in October 2016, the Company’s Indian subsidiary received notices from the Indian Service Tax Department in India seeking to reverse service tax refunds of approximately $121,000 previously granted to our Indian subsidiary for three quarters in 2014, asserting that the services provided by this subsidiary fall under the category of OID Services and not BS Services. The appeal was determined in favor of the Service Tax Department. Management disagrees with the basis of this decision and is contesting it. The Company expects delays in its Indian subsidiary receiving further service tax refunds until this matter is adjudicated with finality, and currently has service tax credits of approximately $0.8 million recorded as a receivable. Based on the Company’s assessment, in consultation with our tax counsel, the Company has not recorded any tax liability for this case. Substantial recovery against us in the above referenced 2015 Service Tax Department case could have a material adverse impact on us, and unfavorable rulings or recoveries in other tax proceedings could have a material impact on the consolidated operating results of the period in which the rulings or recovery occurs. If tax authorities in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate contest the manner in which we allocate our profits, our net loss could be higher. A significant portion of the services we provide to our customers are provided by our Asian subsidiaries located in different jurisdictions. Tax authorities in some of these jurisdictions have from time to time challenged the manner in which we allocate our profits among our subsidiaries, and we may not prevail in any future challenge of this type. If such a challenge were successful, our worldwide effective tax rate could increase, thereby decreasing our profitability. An expiration or termination of our preferential tax rate incentives could adversely affect our results of operations. Two of our foreign subsidiaries are subject to preferential tax rates. This tax incentive provides that we pay reduced income taxes with respect to those jurisdictions for a fixed period of time. An expiration or termination of these incentives could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, or increase our tax expense, thereby decreasing our net income and adversely affecting our results of operations. 22 Table of Contents Our earnings may be adversely affected if we change our intent not to repatriate our foreign earnings and profits or if such earnings and profits become subject to U.S. tax on a current basis. A significant portion of our operations are conducted outside the U.S. Despite our access to the overseas earnings and the resulting toll charge, we intend to indefinitely reinvest the foreign earnings in our foreign subsidiaries on account of the foreign jurisdiction withholding tax that the Company has to incur on the actual remittances. Unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries amounted to approximately $50.9 million at December 31, 2022. If such earnings are repatriated in the future, or are no longer deemed to be indefinitely reinvested, the Company would have to accrue as a liability the applicable amount of foreign jurisdiction withholding taxes associated with such remittances. It is unlikely that we will pay dividends. We have not paid any cash dividends since our inception and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We expect that our earnings, if any, will be used to finance our growth. Risks Related to Laws and Regulations Governmental and customer focus on data security could increase our costs of operations. In addition, any incident in which we fail to protect our customer’s information against security breaches may result in monetary damages against us, and termination of our engagement by our customer, and may adversely impact our results of operations. Certain laws and regulations regarding data privacy and security affecting our customers impose requirements regarding the privacy and security of information maintained by these customers, as well as notification to persons whose personal information is accessed by an unauthorized third party. As a result of any continuing legislative initiatives and customer demands, we may have to modify our operations with the goal of further improving data security. The cost of compliance with these laws and regulations is high and is likely to increase in the future. Any such modifications may result in increased expenses and operating complexity, and we may be unable to increase the rates we charge for our services sufficiently to offset these increases. In addition, as part of the services we perform, we have access to confidential customer data, including personal data. As a result, we are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect this information. We may also be bound by certain customer agreements to use and disclose the confidential customer information in a manner consistent with the privacy standards under regulations applicable to such customer. Any failure on our part to comply with these laws and regulations can result in negative publicity and diversion of management’s time and effort and may subject us to significant liabilities and other penalties. If customer confidential information is inappropriately disclosed due to a breach of our computer systems, system failures or otherwise, or if any person, including any of our employees, negligently disregards or intentionally breaches controls or procedures with which we are responsible for complying with respect to such data or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data, we may have substantial liabilities to our customers. Any incidents with respect to the handling of such information could subject us to litigation or indemnification claims with our customers and other parties. In addition, any breach or alleged breach of our confidentiality agreements with our customers may result in termination of their engagements, resulting in associated loss of revenue and increased costs. Our business is subject to applicable laws and regulations relating to foreign corrupt practices, the violation of which could adversely affect our operations. We must comply with all applicable anti-bribery laws and regulations of the U.S. and other jurisdictions where we operate. For example, we are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010 relating to corrupt and illegal payments to government officials and others. Although we have policies and controls in place that are designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, it is possible that an employee or an agent acting on our behalf could fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, and due to the complex nature of the risks, it may not always be possible for us to ascertain compliance with such laws and regulations. In such event, we could be exposed to civil penalties, criminal penalties and other sanctions, including fines or other unintended punitive actions, and we could incur substantial legal fees and related expenses. In addition, such violations could damage our business and/or our reputation. All of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. 23 Table of Contents Anti-outsourcing legislation, if adopted, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and impair our ability to service our customers. The issue of outsourcing of services abroad by U.S. companies is a topic of political discussion in the U.S. While no substantive anti-outsourcing legislation has been adopted to date, given the ongoing debate over this issue, the introduction of such legislation is possible. If introduced, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected and our ability to service our customers could be impaired. Our growth could be hindered by visa restrictions. Occasionally, we have employees from our other facilities visit or transfer to the U.S. to meet our customers or work on projects at a customer’s site. Any visa restrictions or new legislation putting a restriction on issuing visas could affect our business. Immigration and visa laws and regulations in the U.S. and other countries are subject to legislative and administrative changes, as well as changes in the application of standards. Immigration and visa laws and regulations can be significantly affected by political forces and levels of economic activity. Our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected if legislative or administrative changes to immigration or visa laws and regulations impair our ability to staff projects with our professionals who are not citizens of the country where the work is to be performed. New and changing corporate governance and public disclosure requirements add uncertainty to our compliance policies and increase our costs of compliance. Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to accounting, corporate governance and public disclosure, including SEC regulations and the Nasdaq Stock Market rules, create uncertainty for companies like ours. These laws, regulations and standards may lack specificity and are subject to varying interpretations. Their application in practice may evolve over time, as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs of compliance as a result of revisions to such corporate governance standards. Although we are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure, and complying with evolving laws, regulations and standards, if we fail to comply with new or changed laws, regulations or standards of corporate governance, our business and reputation may be harmed. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. None. Item 2. Properties. Our services are primarily performed from our Ridgefield Park, New Jersey headquarters and overseas delivery centers in the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka, Canada, the United Kingdom Israel and Germany all of which are leased. The square footage of all our leased properties totals approximately 179,000. Our leased properties in the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Germany and Israel are primarily used by our DDS segment; and our leased property in India is primarily used by our DDS and Synodex segments and our leased property in Canada and the United Kingdom is primarily used by our Agility segment. Our leased property in the United States is our corporate headquarters and is used by all segments. In addition, we may need to lease additional property in the future. We believe that we will be able to obtain suitable additional facilities on commercially reasonable terms on an “as needed” basis. Item 3. Legal Proceedings. Reference is made to Note 6, “Commitments and Contingencies - Litigation,” to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report, which is incorporated by reference herein. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures. Not applicable. 24 Table of Contents PART II Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Report. In addition to historical information, this discussion includes forward-looking information that involves risks and assumptions based upon management’s current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from the results referred to in any forward-looking statements. See “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” included elsewhere in this Report. Executive Overview We are a global data engineering company. We operate in three reporting segments: Digital Data Solutions (DDS), Synodex and Agility. The following table sets forth certain financial data for the two years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (Dollars in millions) ​ ​ Years Ended December 31, ​ 2022 % of revenue 2021 % of revenue Revenues ​ $ 79.0 100.0 % $ 69.7 100.0 % Direct operating costs ​ 51.5 65.1 % 43.5 62.4 % Selling and administrative expenses ​ 38.0 48.2 % 27.9 40.0 % Loss from operations ​ (10.5) (13.3) % (1.7) (2.4) % Interest income (expense) ​ 0.0 ​ 0.1 ​ Gain on loan forgiveness ​ - ​ 0.6 ​ Loss before provision for income taxes ​ (10.5) ​ (1.0) ​ Provision for income taxes ​ 1.5 ​ ​ 0.8 ​ Net Loss ​ $ (12.0) ​ $ (1.8) ​ ​ For a summary of our Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies, please refer to Note 1 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements, which are included elsewhere in this Report. Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to the financial information prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP (“GAAP”), we provide certain non-GAAP financial information. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures assist investors in making comparisons of period-to-period operating results. In some respects, management believes non-GAAP financial measures are more indicative of our ongoing core operating performance than their GAAP equivalents by making adjustments that management believes are reflective of the ongoing performance of the business. We believe that the presentation of this non-GAAP financial information provides investors with greater transparency by providing investors a more complete understanding of our financial performance, competitive position, and prospects for the future, particularly by providing the same information that management and our Board of Directors use to evaluate our performance and manage the business. However, the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have certain limitations in that they do not reflect all of the costs associated with the operations of our business as determined in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, investors should consider non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or as superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Further, the non-GAAP financial measures that we present may differ from similar non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) attributable to Innodata Inc. and its subsidiaries in accordance with U.S. GAAP before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization of intangible assets (which derives EBITDA), plus additional adjustments for loss on impairment of intangible assets and goodwill, stock-based compensation, income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests and other one-time costs. We use Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate core results of operations and trends between fiscal periods and believe that these measures are important components of our internal performance measurement process. 26 Table of Contents The following table contains a reconciliation of GAAP net income (loss) attributable to Innodata Inc. and its subsidiaries to Adjusted EBITDA (loss) for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands). ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Year Ended December 31, Consolidated ​ 2022 2021 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Net loss attributable to Innodata Inc. and Subsidiaries ​ $ (11,935) ​ $ (1,673) Provision for income taxes ​ 1,522 ​ 842 Interest expense (income), net ​ 11 ​ (108) Gain on loan forgiveness ​ - ​ (580) Depreciation and amortization ​ 3,889 ​ 2,869 Stock-based compensation ​ 3,283 ​ 1,750 Non-controlling interests ​ (70) ​ (132) Adjusted EBITDA / (loss) - Consolidated ​ $ (3,300) ​ $ 2,968 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Year Ended December 31, DDS Segment 2022 2021 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Net income (loss) attributable to DDS Segment ​ $ (711) ​ $ 4,989 Provision for income taxes ​ 1,423 ​ 958 Interest expense (income), net ​ 10 ​ (110) Gain on loan forgiveness ​ - ​ (580) Depreciation and amortization ​ 694 ​ 638 Stock-based compensation ​ 2,690 ​ 1,286 Non-controlling interests ​ 4 ​ - Adjusted EBITDA - DDS Segment ​ $ 4,110 ​ $ 7,181 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Year Ended December 31, Synodex Segment ​ 2022 2021 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Net loss attributable to Synodex Segment ​ $ (2,525) ​ $ (1,394) Depreciation and amortization ​ $ 656 ​ 62 Stock-based compensation ​ 258 ​ 98 Non-controlling interests ​ (74) ​ (132) Adjusted EBITDA (loss) - Synodex Segment ​ $ (1,685) ​ $ (1,366) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Year Ended December 31, Agility Segment ​ 2022 2021 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Net loss attributable to Agility Segment ​ $ (8,699) ​ $ (5,268) Provision for income taxes ​ 99 ​ (116) Interest expense, net ​ 1 ​ 2 Depreciation and amortization ​ 2,539 ​ 2,169 Stock-based compensation ​ 335 ​ 366 Adjusted EBITDA (loss) - Agility Segment ​ $ (5,725) ​ $ (2,847) ​ Results of Operations Amounts in the MD&A below are after elimination of any inter-segment profit and have been rounded. All percentages have been calculated using rounded amounts. 27 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2021 Revenues Total revenues were $79.0 million and $69.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, an increase of $9.3 million or approximately 13%. Revenues from the DDS segment were $56.5 million and $52.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, an increase of $3.9 million or approximately 8%. The net increase was due to higher volume from two customers, partially offset by lower volume from several customers. Revenues from the Synodex segment were $7.1 million and $4.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, an increase of $2.9 million or approximately 71%. The increase was primarily due to higher volume from three customers. Revenues from the Agility segment were $15.4 million and $13.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 respectively, an increase of $2.4 million or approximately 18%. The increase was attributable to higher volumes from subscriptions to our Agility AI-enabled industry platform and newswire product. One customer in the DDS segment generated approximately 11% of the Company’s total revenues in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. Another customer in the DDS segment generated approximately 11% of the Company’s total revenues in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of total revenues during these periods. Further, in the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, revenues from non-U.S. customers accounted for 38% and 45%, respectively, of the Company’s revenues. Direct Operating Costs Direct operating costs consist of direct and indirect labor costs, occupancy costs, data center hosting fees, cloud services, content acquisition costs, depreciation and amortization, travel, telecommunications, computer services and supplies, realized gain (loss) on forward contracts, foreign currency revaluation gain (loss), and other direct expenses that are incurred in providing services to our customers. Direct operating costs were $51.5 million and $43.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, an increase of $8.0 million or approximately 18%. These cost increases primarily supported our growth initiatives. The increase in Direct operating costs includes direct and indirect labor related costs primarily on account of higher headcount and salary increases of $5.6 million; depreciation and amortization of capitalized developed software of $1.0 million; cloud services of $0.4 million, content costs of $0.3 million, severance cost of $0.3 million, an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations of $0.3 million and other direct operating costs of $0.1 million. Direct operating costs as percentage of total revenues were approximately 65% and 62% for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in direct operating costs as a percentage of revenues during the year was primarily due to an increase in direct operating costs, offset in part by an increase in revenues. Direct operating costs for the DDS segment were $35.1 million and $31.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, an increase of $3.3 million or approximately 10%. These cost increases primarily supported our growth initiatives. The increase in Direct operating costs includes direct and indirect labor related costs primarily on account of higher headcount and salary increases of $2.4 million; severance cost of $0.3 million, cloud services of $0.2 million, an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations of $0.2 million and other direct operating costs of $0.2 million. Direct operating costs for the DDS segment as a percentage of DDS segment revenues were approximately 62% and 60% for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in direct operating costs of the DDS segment as a percentage of DDS segment revenues during the year was primarily due to an increase in direct operating costs, offset in part by an increase in revenues. Direct operating costs for the Synodex segment were approximately $8.0 million and $4.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, an increase of $3.6 million or approximately 82%. The cost increase primarily supported our growth initiatives combined with the timing of new technology roll-out. The increase in Direct operating costs was primarily due to an increase in direct labor costs on account of higher headcount and salary increases of $2.9 million, depreciation and amortization of capitalized developed software of $0.6 million, and cloud services of $0.2 million, offset in part by a decrease in other direct operating costs of $0.1 million. Direct operating costs for the Synodex segment as a percentage of segment revenues were approximately 113% and 105% for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in direct operating costs of the Synodex segment as a percentage of Synodex segment revenues during the year was primarily due to an increase in direct operating costs, offset in part by an increase in revenues. 28 Table of Contents Direct operating costs for the Agility segment were approximately $8.4 million and $7.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, an increase of $1.1 million or approximately 15%. The cost increase was primarily due to higher amortization of capitalized developed software of $0.4 million, content costs of $0.3 million, higher labor related costs of $0.3 million, and an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations of $0.1 million. Direct operating costs for the Agility segment as a percentage of Agility segment revenues were approximately 55% and 56% for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease in direct operating costs of the Agility segment as a percentage of Agility segment revenues during the year was primarily due to higher volumes from subscriptions to our Agility AI-enabled industry platform and newswire product, offset in part by an increase in direct operating costs. Selling and Administrative Expenses Selling and administrative expenses consist of sales, marketing, new services research and related software development, administrative payroll and related costs including commissions, bonuses, stock-based compensation, marketing costs, third-party software, advertising, trade conferences, professional fees and consultant costs, and other administrative overhead costs. Selling and administrative expenses were approximately $38.0 million and $27.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, an increase of $10.1 million or approximately 36%. The cost increase primarily supported our growth initiatives across all business segments. The selling and administrative cost increase includes payroll related costs for new hires, stock-based compensation, commissions, incentives, and bonuses of $6.3 million, marketing activity related costs of $1.6 million, recruitment and professional fees of $0.6 million, provisions for doubtful accounts of $0.4 million, severance costs of $0.3 million, leasehold improvement write-offs from lease terminations of $0.2 million, an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations of $0.1 million and other selling and administrative costs of $0.6 million. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues were approximately 48% and 40% for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues during the year was primarily due to increased selling and administrative costs, offset in part by an increase in revenues. Selling and administrative expenses for the DDS segment were approximately $20.7 million and $15.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 respectively, an increase of $5.2 million or approximately 32%. The cost increase primarily supported our growth initiatives. The selling and administrative cost increase includes payroll related costs for new hires, stock-based compensation, commissions, incentives, and bonuses of $2.9 million, marketing activity related costs of $0.9 million, recruitment and professional fees of $0.4 million, provisions for doubtful accounts of $0.3 million, leasehold improvement write-offs from lease terminations of $0.1 million, and other selling and administrative costs of $0.6 million. Selling and administrative expenses for the DDS segment as a percentage of DDS segment revenue were approximately 37% and 29% for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in selling and administrative expenses of the DDS segment as a percentage of DDS segment revenues was due to increased selling and administrative expenses, offset in part by an increase in revenues. Selling and administrative expenses for the Synodex segment were $1.7 million and $1.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 respectively, an increase of $0.4 million or approximately 31%. The cost increase was primarily attributable to payroll related costs and recruitment fees for new hires and other professional fees of $0.4 million to support our growth initiatives. Selling and administrative expenses for the Synodex segment as a percentage of Synodex segment revenues were approximately 24% and 31% for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease in selling and administrative expenses of the Synodex segment as a percentage of Synodex segment revenues was due to an increase in revenues, offset in part by an increase in selling and administrative expenses. Selling and administrative expenses for the Agility segment were $15.6 million and $11.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, an increase of $4.5 million or approximately 41%. The selling and administrative costs increase includes payroll related costs for new hires, stock-based compensation, commissions, incentives of $3.5 million, marketing activity related costs of $0.7 million, severance costs of $0.3 million, provisions for doubtful accounts of $0.1 million, leasehold improvement write-offs from lease terminations of $0.1 million, and an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations of $0.1 million; partly offset by decreases in recruitment and professional fees of $0.3 million. Selling and administrative expenses for the Agility segment as a percentage of Agility segment revenues were approximately 101% and 85% for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in selling and administrative expenses of the Agility segment as a percentage of Agility segment revenues was due to increased selling and administrative expenses, offset in part by an increase in revenues. 29 Table of Contents Goodwill and Intangible Asset Impairment As of September 30, 2022, we performed our annual goodwill impairment analysis on one of our reporting units, the Agility segment. We also tested the intangible assets of the Agility and Synodex segments for impairment. The impairment test involves estimating the fair value based on a combination of income (estimates of future discounted cash flows) and the market approach (market multiples for similar companies) using unobservable inputs (Level 3). The income approach uses a discounted cash flow (“DCF”) method that utilizes the present value of cash flows to estimate the segment’s fair value. The income approach uses a discounted cash flow (“DCF”) method that utilizes the present value of cash flows to estimate the segment's fair value. The future cash flows of the segment were projected based on our estimates of future revenue, operating income, and other factors such as working capital and capital expenditures. As part of the DCF analysis, we projected revenue and operating profits and assumed long-term revenue growth rates in the terminal year. The market approach utilizes multiples of revenues and earnings before interest expense, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (“EBITDA”) to estimate the segment’s fair value. The market multiples used for the segment were based on a group of comparable companies’ market multiples applied to our revenue. We concluded that there is no impairment of goodwill or intangible assets for the Agility segment, and no impairment of intangible assets for the Synodex segment. Gain on PPP Loan Forgiveness On May 4, 2020, we received loan proceeds of $579,700 under the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) which was established as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act of 2020, as amended. On May 21, 2021, our loan forgiveness application was approved for 100% of the amount loaned to the Company by the Small Business Administration (“SBA”). Income Taxes We recorded a provision for income taxes of approximately $1.5 million and $0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Tax-related charges primarily consisted of a provision for foreign taxes recorded in accordance with the local tax regulations by our foreign subsidiaries. Effective income tax rates are disproportionate primarily due to the valuation allowance recorded on the deferred taxes of the U.S., and Canadian, German and the United Kingdom subsidiaries. See Note 4, “Income Taxes” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. The reconciliation of the U.S. statutory rate with the Company’s effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 are summarized in the table below: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 2022 2021 Federal income tax expense (benefit) at statutory rate (21.0) % (21.0) % Effect of: ​ Change in valuation allowance 36.9 186.1 ​ Tax effects of foreign operations 2.5 2.0 ​ Foreign operations permanent differences - foreign exchange gains and losses 1.1 9.5 ​ Increase in unrecognized tax benefits (ASC 740) 0.7 (22.8) ​ State income tax net of federal benefit 0.2 1.9 ​ Return to provision true up 0.3 (2.3) ​ Effect of Section 162 (m) 0.0 29.90 ​ Change in rates - 12.2 ​ Effect of stock-based compensation (0.3) (72.1) ​ Deemed interest (1.9) (1.4) ​ Foreign rate differential (4.7) (31.8) ​ Other 0.7 (2.8) ​ Effective tax rate 14.5 % 87.4 % ​ Despite access to overseas earnings and the resulting toll charge, we intend to indefinitely reinvest earnings and profits in our foreign subsidiaries on account of the foreign jurisdiction withholding taxes that we would have to incur on the actual remittances. Unremitted foreign earnings and profits amounted to approximately $50.9 million at December 31, 2022. If such foreign earnings and profits are repatriated in the future, or are no longer deemed to be indefinitely reinvested, we would have to accrue the applicable amount of foreign jurisdiction withholding taxes associated with such remittances. 30 Table of Contents We have a valuation allowance on all of our U.S. deferred tax assets on account of continuing losses incurred by our U.S. entity. In addition, we also have a valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets of our Canadian, German and the United Kingdom subsidiaries. Our Canadian subsidiaries also have research and development credits available to reduce taxable income in future years, which may be carried forward indefinitely. The potential benefits from these balances have not been recognized for financial statement purposes. Tax Assessments In September 2015, our Indian subsidiary was subject to an inquiry by the Service Tax Department in India regarding the classification of services provided by this subsidiary, asserting that the services provided by this subsidiary fall under the category of online information and database access or retrieval services (OID Services), and not under the category of business support services (BS Services) that are exempt from service tax as historically indicated in the subsidiary’s service tax filings. We disagree with the Service Tax Department’s position. In November 2019, the Commissioner of Central Tax, GST & Central Excise issued an order confirming the Service Tax Department’s position. We are contesting this order in an appeal to the Customs, Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal. In the event the Service Tax Department is ultimately successful in proving that the services fall under the category of OID Services, the revenues earned by our Indian subsidiary for the period July 2012 through November 2016 would be subject to a service tax of between 12.36% and 15%, and this subsidiary may also be liable for interest and penalties. The revenue of our Indian subsidiary during this period was approximately $57.0 million. In accordance with new rules promulgated by the Service Tax Department, as of December 1, 2016 service tax is no longer applicable to OID or BS Services. Based on our assessment in consultation with our tax counsel, we have not recorded any tax liability for this case. In a separate action relating to service tax refunds, in October 2016, our Indian subsidiary received notices from the Indian Service Tax Department in India seeking to reverse service tax refunds of approximately $121,000 previously granted to our Indian subsidiary for three quarters in 2014, asserting that the services provided by this subsidiary fall under the category of OID Services and not BS Services. The appeal was determined in favor of the Service Tax Department. We disagree with the basis of this decision and is contesting it. We expect delays in our Indian subsidiary receiving further service tax refunds until this matter is adjudicated with finality, and currently have service tax credits of approximately $0.8 million recorded as a receivable. Based on our assessment in consultation with our tax counsel, we have not recorded any tax liability for this case. Substantial recovery against us in the above referenced 2015 Service Tax Department case could have a material adverse impact on us, and unfavorable rulings or recoveries in other tax proceedings could have a material adverse impact on the consolidated operating results of the period (and subsequent periods) in which the rulings or recovery occurs. Net Income (Loss) We had a net loss of $12.0 million and $1.8 million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The $10.2 million change was due to higher Direct operating costs and Selling and administrative expenses in all segments in the current fiscal year, offset in part by higher revenues in all segments, and a one-time gain on loan forgiveness amounting to $0.6 million recognized in 2021 for the DDS segment. Net loss for the DDS segment was $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to a net income of $5.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The $5.8 million change was due to higher Direct operating costs and Selling and administrative expenses offset in part by higher revenues in the current fiscal year, and a one-time gain on loan forgiveness amounting to $0.6 million recognized in 2021. Net loss for the Synodex segment was $2.6 million and $1.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The $1.1 million change was primarily due to higher Direct operating costs and Selling and administrative expenses, offset in part by higher revenues in the current fiscal year. Net loss for the Agility segment was $8.7 million and $5.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The $3.4 million change was primarily due to higher Direct operating costs and Selling and administrative expenses, offset in part by higher revenues in the current fiscal year. Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2022 was a loss of $3.3 million compared to an income of $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The $6.3 million change in Adjusted EBITDA was due to higher operating costs offset in part by higher revenues in all segments. 31 Table of Contents Adjusted EBITDA for the DDS segment was $4.1 million and $7.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The $3.0 million change in Adjusted EBITDA was due to higher operating costs offset in part by higher revenues in the current fiscal year. Adjusted EBITDA for the Synodex segment was a loss of $1.7 million and $1.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The $0.3 million change in Adjusted EBITDA was due to higher operating costs offset in part by higher revenues in the current fiscal year. Adjusted EBITDA for the Agility segment was a loss of $5.7 million and $2.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The $3.0 million change in Adjusted EBITDA was due to higher operating costs offset in part by higher revenues in the current fiscal year. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, please see the description of “Non-GAAP Financial Measures - Adjusted EBITDA” above. Liquidity and Capital Resources Selected measures of liquidity and capital resources, expressed in thousands, are as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ December 31, ​ 2022 2021 Cash and cash equivalents ​ $ 9,792 ​ $ 18,902 Short term investments - other ​ ​ 507 ​ ​ - Working capital ​ 2,869 ​ 12,658 ​ On December 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of $9.8 million and short-term investments of $0.5 million, of which $3.6 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries, and $6.2 million was held in the United States. The short-term investments of $0.5 million were held in the United States. Despite the passage of the new tax law under which we may repatriate funds from overseas after paying the toll charge, it is our intent, as of December 31, 2022, to indefinitely reinvest the overseas funds in our foreign subsidiaries due to the withholding tax that we would have to incur on the actual remittances. We have used, and plan to use, our cash and cash equivalents for (i) capital investments; (ii) the expansion of our other operations; (iii) technology innovation; (iv) product management and strategic marketing; (v) general corporate purposes, including working capital; and (vi) possible business acquisitions. As of December 31, 2022, we had working capital of approximately $2.9 million, as compared to working capital of approximately $12.7 million as of December 31, 2021. The decrease in working capital is due to cash used to finance capital expenditures, payment of long-term obligations and operating losses incurred in the current fiscal year. Gain on PPP Loan Forgiveness On May 4, 2020, we received loan proceeds of $579,700 under the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) which was established as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act of 2020, as amended. On May 21, 2021, the Company’s loan forgiveness application was approved for 100% of the amount loaned to the Company by the Small Business Administration (“SBA”). Proceeds from stock option exercises for the year ended December 31, 2022 were $0.3 million. We did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures as of December 31, 2022. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash flows from operations will provide sufficient sources of liquidity to satisfy our financial needs for at least 12 months from the date of issuance of these financial statements. However, as we have no bank facilities or lines of credit, reductions in our cash and cash equivalents from operating losses, capital expenditures, adverse legal decisions, acquisitions or otherwise could materially and adversely affect the Company. 32 Table of Contents Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Cash used in our operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $1.2 million and was the result of the net loss of $12.0 million, the effect of adjustments for non-cash items of $8.9 million and sources of working capital of $1.9 million. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of $3.9 million for depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation of $3.3 million, pension cost of $0.9 million, provision for doubtful accounts of $0.5 million, deferred income tax of $0.2 million, loss on lease termination of $0.1 million and other non-cash items of $0.1 million. Working capital activities primarily consisted of sources from a $1.3 million decrease in accounts receivable, a $0.8 million decrease in other assets, a $0.3 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other and a $0.1 million increase in other working capital, offset in part by a $0.3 million decrease in accrued salaries, wages and related benefits, a $0.3 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets. Refer to the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for further details. Cash provided by our operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $5.1 million and was the result of the net loss of $1.8 million, the effect of adjustments for non-cash items of $4.6 million and sources of working capital of $2.3 million. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of $2.9 million for depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation of $1.8 million, pension cost of $ 0.5 million, offset in part by a gain on loan forgiveness of $0.6 million. Working capital activities primarily consisted of sources from a $4.4 million increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other, a $0.7 million increase in accrued salaries, wages and related benefits, a $0.5 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets and a $0.3 million increase in other assets, offset by a $1.9 million increase in accounts receivable and $1.7 million decrease in income and other taxes. Refer to the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for further details. Our days’ sales outstanding were 48 days and 56 days for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We calculate DSO by first dividing the total revenues for the period by average net accounts receivable, which is the average of net accounts receivable at the beginning of the period and net accounts receivable at the end of the period, to yield an amount we refer to as the “accounts receivable turnover”. Then we divide the total number of days within the period reported by the accounts receivable turnover to yield DSO expressed in number of days. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities Cash used in our investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $7.0 million consisting of capital expenditures of $6.5 million and the purchase of short-term investments of $0.5 million. These capital expenditures were principally for the purchase of technology equipment including servers, network infrastructure and workstations, and expenditures for capitalized developed software. Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2022 amounting to $6.5 million consisted of $2.0 million for the Agility segment, $3.1 million for the DDS segment and $1.4 million for the Synodex segment. Cash used in our investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $4.4 million for capital expenditures. These capital expenditures were principally for the purchase of technology equipment including servers, network infrastructure and workstations, and expenditures for capitalized developed software. Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $2.1 million for the Agility segment, $1.7 million for the DDS segment and $0.6 million for the Synodex segment. For calendar year 2023, we anticipate that capital expenditures for ongoing technology, equipment, new platform development, and infrastructure upgrades will approximate to $6.0 million, a portion of which we may finance. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily for payments of long-term obligation of $0.6 million, reduced in part by proceeds from stock option exercises of $0.3 million. Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was proceeds from stock option exercises of $2.2 million. Cash paid for withholding taxes on net settlement exercises of stock options for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $0.8 million. Payments of long-term obligations were $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. 33 Table of Contents Inflation, Seasonality and Prevailing Economic Conditions Although most of our revenues are denominated in U.S. dollars, a significant portion of our revenues is denominated in Canadian dollars, Pound Sterling and Euros. In addition, a significant portion of our expenses, primarily labor expenses in the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka, Germany, Canada and Israel, are incurred in the local currencies of the countries in which we operate. For financial reporting purposes, we translate all non-U.S. denominated transactions into U.S. dollars in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Thus, we are exposed to the risk that fluctuations in the value of these currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could have a direct impact on our revenues and our results of operations. The Philippines and India have at times experienced high rates of inflation as well as major fluctuations in the exchange rate between the Philippine peso and the U.S. dollar and the Indian rupee and the U.S. dollar. As of December 31, 2022, the aggregate notional amount of our hedges was $14.2 million consisting of approximately $7.1 million against the Indian rupee, and $7.1 million against the Philippine peso. Fluctuations in exchange rates also affect the value of funds held by our foreign subsidiaries. We do not currently intend to hedge these assets. Our most significant costs are the salaries and related benefits of our employees in Asia. We are exposed to high inflation in wage rates in the countries in which we operate. We generally perform work for our customers under project-specific contracts, requirements-based contracts or long-term contracts. We must adequately anticipate wage increases, particularly on our fixed-price contracts. There can be no assurance that we will be able to recover cost increases through increases in the prices that we charge for our services to our customers. Our quarterly operating results are subject to certain fluctuations. We experience fluctuations in our revenue and earnings as we replace and begin new projects, which may have some normal start-up delays, or we may be unable to replace a project entirely. These and other factors may contribute to fluctuations in our operating results from quarter to quarter. In addition, as some of our Asian facilities are closed during holidays in the fourth quarter, we typically incur higher wages, due to overtime, that reduce our margins. Our Synodex subsidiary experiences seasonal fluctuations in revenues. Typically, revenue is lowest in the third quarter of the calendar year and highest in the fourth quarter of the calendar year. The seasonality is directly linked to the number of life insurance applications received by the insurance companies. Trends We view new customer acquisition as an indicator of our business momentum, sales and marketing efficiency, and competitive market positioning. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we added an average of 126 new customers per year. This is an 35% increase over the 93 new customers we added on average per year in 2021 and a 102% increase over the 62 new customers we added on average per year in 2020. Item 7A.

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and disposition of assets; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of company assets are made in accordance with management and director authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected. Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) - issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022.

Ridgefield Park, New Jersey Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Innodata Inc. (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operation and comprehensive loss, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 1. Measurement of the provision for income tax exposures Description of Matter The Company is subject to income taxes in multiple tax jurisdictions and during the ordinary course of business, there are many tax positions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain due to complexities of transfer pricing and changing tax laws, and is involved in various tax litigations with respective tax authorities. Uncertainties arise primarily from certain ongoing tax litigations and open tax years for its foreign subsidiaries. As described in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, at December 31, 2022, the Company has recorded unrecognized tax benefits of $1.7 million for uncertain tax positions. We identified measurement of accruals for the aforementioned income tax exposures as a critical audit matter, as the amounts involved are material, and the determination of provision for taxes requires the Company to make judgments on tax issues and develop F-2 Table of Contents estimates regarding the Company’s exposure to tax risks. Further, auditing management judgments on whether the tax positions are probable of being sustained in tax assessments involves a high degree of subjectivity. How the matter was addressed in our audit: The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included: /S/ BDO India LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2020.

AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Estimates and Policies Description of Business - Innodata Inc. (NASDAQ: INOD) (including its subsidiaries, the “Company”, “Innodata”, “we”, “us” or “our”) is a leading data engineering company. The Company’s mission is to help the world’s most prestigious companies deliver the promise of ethical, high-performing artificial intelligence (“AI”), which the Company believes will contribute to a safer and more prosperous world. The Company was founded on a simple idea: engineer the highest quality data so organizations across broad industry segments could make smarter decisions. Today, the Company believes it is delivering the highest quality data for some of the world’s most innovative technology companies to use to train the AI models of the future. AI holds the promise that computers can perceive and understand the world, enabling products and services that would have been previously unimaginable and impossible with traditional coding. AI learns from data, and the highest-performing AI will have learned from the highest-quality data. The Company believes that it can contribute meaningfully by harnessing its capabilities, honed over 30 years, in collecting and annotating data at scale with consistency and high accuracy. The Company is also helping companies deploy and integrate AI into their operations and products and providing innovative AI-enabled industry platforms, helping ensure that its customers’ businesses are prepared for a world in which machines augment human activity in ways previously unimaginable. The Company developed its capabilities and honed its approaches progressively over the last 30 years creating high-quality data for many of the world’s most demanding information companies. Approximately seven years ago, the Company formed Innodata Labs, a research and development center, to research, develop and apply machine learning and emerging AI to its large-scale, human-intensive data operations. In 2019, the Company began packaging the capabilities that emerged from its R&D efforts in order to align with several fast-growing new markets and help companies use AI/ML to drive performance benefits and business insights. The Company’s historical core competency in high-quality data, combined with these R&D efforts in applied AI, created the foundation for the evolution of the Company’s offerings, which include AI Data Preparation, AI Model Deployment and Integration, and AI-Enabled Industry Platforms. AI Data Preparation The Company collects or creates training data, annotates training data, and trains AI algorithms for social media companies, robotics companies, financial services companies, and many others, working with images, text, video and audio. The Company utilizes a variety of leading third-party image and video annotation tools. For text, the Company uses its proprietary data annotation platform that incorporates AI to reduce cost while improving consistency and quality of output. The Company’s proprietary data annotation platform features auto-tagging capabilities that apply to both classical and generative AI tasks. The platform encapsulates many of the innovations the Company has conceived of in the course of its 30-year history of creating high-quality data. In addition, because collecting real-world data is often impracticable (due to data privacy regulations or rarity of cohorts and outliers), the Company creates high-quality synthetic data that maintains all of the statistical properties of real-world data, using a combination of domain specialists and machine technologies that leverage large language models (LLMs). AI Model Deployment and Integration The Company helps businesses leverage the latest AI technologies to achieve their goals. The Company develops custom AI models (where it selects the appropriate algorithms, tunes hyperparameters, trains and validates the models, and updates the models as required). The Company also helps businesses fine-tune their own custom versions of the Company’s proprietary models and third-party foundation models to address domain-specific and customer-specific use cases. In addition to deploying and integrating AI models, the Company often provides a range of data engineering support services including data transformation, data curation, data hygiene, data consolidation, data extraction, data compliance, and master data management. The Company’s customers span a diverse range of industries and a wide range of AI use cases, benefiting from the short time-to-value and high economic returns of the Company’s AI solutions and platforms. F-8 Table of Contents INNODATA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AI-Enabled Industry Platforms The Company’s AI-enabled industry platforms address specific, niche market requirements the Company believes it can innovate with AI/ML technologies. The Company deploys these industry platforms as software-as-a-service (SaaS) and as managed services. These platforms benefit from the Company’s technology infrastructure, its industry-specific knowledge, its strong customer relationships and experience merging technology with the business processes of its customers. To date, the Company has built an industry platform for medical records data extraction and transformation (which the Company brands as “Synodex ® ”) and an industry platform for public relations (which the Company brands as “Agility PR Solutions”). The Company is in development with an additional AI-enabled industry platform to serve financial services institutions. The Company’s Synodex industry platform transforms medical records into useable digital data organized in accordance with its proprietary data models or customer data models. The Company’s Agility industry platform provides marketing communications and public relations professionals with the ability to target and distribute content to journalists and social media influencers world-wide and to monitor and analyze global news (print, web, radio and TV) and social media. The Company’s operations are presently classified and reported in three reporting segments: Digital Data Solutions (DDS), Synodex and Agility. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Principles of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Innodata Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, and docGenix, a limited liability company that is majority-owned by the Company. The non-controlling interests in the docGenix limited liability company have call and put options that can be settled in cash or stock. Accordingly, this is presented in temporary equity in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) non-controlling interest guidance. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Use of Estimates - In preparing consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management believes that the estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are reasonable, and management has made assumptions about the possible effects of the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic on critical and significant accounting estimates. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include those related to the allowance for doubtful accounts and billing adjustments, useful life of long-lived assets, useful life of intangible assets, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, valuation of deferred tax assets, valuation of stock-based compensation, pension benefit plan assumptions, litigation accruals and estimated accruals for various tax exposures. Revenue Recognition - The Company’s revenue is recognized when services are rendered or goods are delivered to a customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for those services or goods as per the agreement with the customer. In cases where there are agreements with multiple performance obligations, the Company identifies each performance obligation and evaluates whether the performance obligations are distinct within the context of the agreement at the agreement’s inception. Performance obligations that are not distinct at agreement inception are combined. For agreements with distinct performance obligations, the Company allocates the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation proportionately based on the estimated standalone selling price for each performance obligation, if any, and then evaluates how the services are performed for the customer to determine the timing of revenue recognition. For the Digital Data Solutions (DDS) segment, revenue is recognized primarily based on the quantity delivered or resources utilized in the period in which services are performed and performance conditions are satisfied as per the agreement. Revenue from agreements billed on a time-and-materials basis is recognized as services are performed. Revenue from fixed-fee agreements, which is not significant to overall revenues, is recognized based on the proportional performance method of accounting, as services are performed, or milestones are achieved. For the Synodex segment, revenue is recognized primarily based on the quantity delivered in the period in which services are performed and performance conditions are satisfied as per the agreement. A portion of the Synodex segment revenue is derived from licensing the Company’s functional software and providing access to the Company’s hosted software platform. Revenue from such F-9 Table of Contents INNODATA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS services is recognized monthly when all parties to the agreement have agreed to the agreement; each party’s rights are identifiable; the payment terms are identifiable; the agreement has commercial substance; access to the service is provided to the end user; and collection is probable. The Agility segment derives its revenue primarily from subscription arrangements and provision of enriched media analysis services. It also derives revenue as a reseller of corporate communication solutions. Revenue from subscriptions is recognized monthly when access to the service is provided to the end user; all parties to the agreement have agreed to the agreement; each party’s rights are identifiable; the payment terms are identifiable; the agreement has commercial substance; and collection is probable. Revenue from enriched media analysis services is recognized when the services are performed, and performance conditions are satisfied. Revenue from the reseller agreements is recognized at the gross amount received for the goods in accordance with the Company functioning as a principal due to the Company meeting the following criteria: the Company acts as the primary obligor in the sales transaction; assumes the credit risk; sets the price; can select suppliers; and is involved in the execution of the services, including after sales service. Revenue includes reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses, with the corresponding out-of-pocket expenses included in direct operating costs. Revenue associated with the services provided in one period and billed in a subsequent period is commonly referred to as unbilled revenues and is included under Accounts receivable. The Company considers U.S. GAAP criteria for determining whether to report gross revenue as a principal versus net revenue as an agent. The Company evaluates whether it is in control of the services before the same are transferred to the customer to assess whether it is principal or agent in the arrangement. Contract acquisition costs, which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets, are amortized over the term of a subscription agreement or contract that normally has a duration of 12 months or less. The Company reviews these prepaid acquisition costs on a periodic basis to determine the need to adjust the carrying values for early-terminated contracts. Foreign Currency Translation - The functional currency of the Company’s subsidiaries in the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka, Israel, Hong Kong and Canada (other than the Agility subsidiary) is the U.S. dollar. Transactions denominated in Philippine pesos, Indian and Sri Lankan rupees, Israeli shekels, and Hong Kong and Canadian dollars are translated to U.S. dollars at rates which approximate those in effect on the transaction dates. Monetary assets and all liabilities denominated in foreign currencies on December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 are translated at the exchange rate in effect as of those dates. Non-monetary assets and stockholders’ equity are translated at the appropriate historical rates. Included in direct operating costs were foreign exchange gains resulting from such translations of approximately $ 1.3 million and $ 0.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The functional currency for the Company’s subsidiaries in Germany, the United Kingdom and for the Company’s Agility subsidiary in Canada are the Euro, the Pound Sterling and the Canadian dollar, respectively. The financial statements of these subsidiaries are prepared in these respective currencies. Financial information is translated from the applicable functional currency to the U.S. dollar (the reporting currency) for inclusion in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Income, expenses, and cash flows are translated at weighted-average exchange rates prevailing during the fiscal period, and assets and liabilities are translated at fiscal period-end exchange rates. Resulting translation adjustments are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders’ equity. Foreign exchange transaction gains or losses are included in direct operating costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Derivative Instruments - The Company accounts for derivative transactions in accordance with the FASB’s Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 825, “Financial Instruments”. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the entire change in fair value of the hedging instrument is recorded in Other comprehensive income (loss). When the amounts recorded in Other comprehensive income (loss) are reclassified to earnings, they are included as part of Direct operating costs. For derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, any change in fair value is recorded directly in earnings as part of Direct operating costs. The total notional value of designated outstanding foreign currency forward contracts was $ 14.2 million and $ 19.7 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Cash Equivalents - For financial statement purposes, the Company considers all highly-liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. F-10 Table of Contents INNODATA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Short term Investments-other - For financial statement purposes, the Company considers investments made in time deposits and treasury bills having an original maturity of more than three months but less than one year under short term investments. Property and Equipment - Property and equipment are stated at cost and are depreciated on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which is generally two to ten years . Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the terms of the leases. Certain assets under capital leases are amortized over the lives of the respective leases or the estimated useful lives of the assets, whichever is shorter. Capitalized Developed Software - The Company incurs development costs related to software it develops for its internal use. Qualifying costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized. These costs primarily consist of internal labor and third-party development costs and are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the capitalized developed software, which generally ranges from three to ten years . All other research and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Capitalized developed software in progress as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 were $ 2.8 million and $ 0.6 million respectively. The cumulative completed capitalized developed software as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $ 11.3 million and $ 8.6 million respectively. Long-lived Assets - Management assesses the recoverability of its long-lived assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The following factors, if present, may trigger an impairment review: (i) significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results; (ii) significant negative industry or economic trends; (iii) significant decline in the Company’s stock price for a sustained period; and (iv) a change in the Company’s market capitalization relative to net book value. If the recoverability of these assets is unlikely because of the existence of one or more of the above-mentioned factors, an impairment analysis is performed, using undiscounted cash flow projections. Management makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of these respective assets. An impairment loss will be recognized only if the carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value and is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair value. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets - The Company performs a valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed on each acquisition accounted for as a business combination and allocates the purchase price of each acquired business to its respective net tangible and intangible assets and liabilities. Acquired intangible assets principally consist of technology, customer relationships, backlog and trademarks, having useful lives which range from ten to twelve years . Liabilities related to intangibles principally consist of unfavorable vendor contracts. The Company determines the appropriate useful life by performing an analysis of expected cash flows based on projected financial information of the acquired businesses. Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method, which approximates the pattern in which the majority of the economic benefits are expected to be consumed. Intangible assets are amortized into direct operating costs ratably over their expected related revenue streams over their useful lives. Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the fair value of the acquired net assets. The Company does not amortize goodwill but evaluates it for impairment at the reporting unit level annually during the third quarter of each fiscal year (as of September 30 of that year) or when an event occurs, or circumstances change, that indicates the carrying value may not be recoverable. The Company performed its annual goodwill assessment for the Agility segment as of September 30, 2022 and tested the intangible assets of the Agility and Synodex segments for impairment. The impairment test involves estimating the fair value based on a combination of income (estimates of future discounted cash flows) and the market approach (market multiples for similar companies) using unobservable inputs (Level 3). The Company concluded that there is no impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for the Agility and Synodex segments. Income Taxes - Estimated deferred taxes are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates, as well as any net operating loss or tax credit carryforwards expected to reduce taxes payable in future years. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the estimated deferred tax assets will not be realized. While the Company considers future taxable income in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event that the Company anticipates that it will be able to realize the estimated deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount, an adjustment to the provision for deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made. Similarly, in the event that the Company anticipates that it will not be able to realize the estimated deferred tax assets in the future considering future taxable income, an adjustment to the provision for deferred tax assets would decrease income in the period such determination was made. Changes in the valuation allowance from period to period are included in the Company’s tax provision in the period of change. The Company indefinitely reinvests the foreign earnings in its foreign subsidiaries. If such earnings are F-11 Table of Contents INNODATA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS repatriated in the future, or are no longer deemed to be indefinitely reinvested, the Company would have to accrue as a liability the applicable amount of foreign jurisdiction withholding taxes associated with such remittances. In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considered whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the U.S. and Canadian deferred tax assets will not be realizable. As the expectation of future taxable income resulting from the Synodex and Agility segments cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company maintains a valuation allowance against all the United States, Canadian and European (principally Germany and the United Kingdom net deferred tax assets. The Company accounts for income taxes regarding uncertain tax positions, and recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Accounting for Leases - Accounting Standards for Codifications (ASC 842 “Accounting for Leases”) requires lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets as liabilities, with corresponding “right-of-use” assets. The Company recognizes a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability for all its operating leases. See Note 7, Operating Leases. The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at the inception date and requires an assessment of whether the fulfillment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets, or the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset. A reassessment is made after inception of the lease only if one of the following applies: Whenever a reassessment is made, lease accounting shall commence or cease from the date when the change in circumstances gave rise to the reassessment for scenarios (a), (c) or (d) and at the date of renewal or extension period for scenario (b). Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as operating leases. As of December 31, 2022, all of the Company’s leases are classified under operating leases. Operating lease payments are recognized as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - The Company measures and recognizes stock-based compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors based on the estimated fair value at the grant date. The stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period. The fair value of stock option grants is determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and the fair value of restricted stock units is determined using the Binomial option pricing model. The stock-based compensation expense related to the Company’s stock plans were allocated as follows (in thousands): ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Year Ended December 31, ​ 2022 2021 Direct operating costs ​ $ 214 ​ $ 178 Selling and adminstrative expenses ​ 3,069 ​ 1,572 Total stock-based compensation ​ $ 3,283 ​ $ 1,750 ​ Fair Value of Financial Instruments - The carrying amounts of financial instruments approximated their fair value as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, because of the relative short maturity of these instruments. See Note 14, Derivatives. Fair value measurements and disclosures define fair value as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. F-12 Table of Contents INNODATA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The accounting standard establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels. The three levels are defined as follows: The Company’s forward contracts are at level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Accounts Receivable - The Company establishes credit terms for new customers based upon management’s review of their credit information and project terms, and performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers, adjusting credit terms when management believes appropriate based upon payment history and an assessment of the customer’s current creditworthiness. The Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. The Company determines its allowance by considering a number of factors, including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due (accounts outstanding longer than the payment terms are considered past due), the Company’s previous loss history, the customer’s current ability to pay its obligation to the Company, and the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole. This cannot guarantee that credit loss rates in the future will not be greater than those experienced in the past. In addition, there is credit exposure if the financial condition of one of the Company’s major customers were to deteriorate. In the event that the financial condition of one of the Company’s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be necessary. Concentration of Credit Risk - The Company maintains its cash with highly rated financial institutions, located in the United States and in foreign locations where the Company has its operations. At December 31, 2022, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $ 9.8 million, of which $ 3.6 million was held by its foreign subsidiaries with local banks located mainly in Asia and $ 6.2 million was held in the United States. In addition, we held short term investments of $ 0.5 million in the United States. To the extent that such cash exceeds the maximum insurance levels, the Company is uninsured. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts. Income (Loss) per Share - Income (loss) per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted income (loss) per share is computed by considering the impact of the potential issuance of common shares, using the treasury stock method, on the weighted average number of shares outstanding. For those securities that are not convertible into a class of common stock, the “two class” method of computing income (loss) per share is used. Pension - The Company records annual pension costs based on calculations, which include various actuarial assumptions including discount rates, compensation increases and other assumptions involving demographic factors. The Company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends. The Company believes that the assumptions used in recording its pension obligations are reasonable based on its experience, market conditions and inputs from its actuaries. Deferred Revenue - Deferred revenue represents payments received from customers in advance of providing services and amounts deferred if conditions for revenue recognition have not been met. Included in accrued expenses on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets is deferred revenue amounting to $ 4.4 million and $ 4.5 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We expect to recognize substantially all of these performance obligations over the next 12 months. F-13 Table of Contents INNODATA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Recent Accounting Pronouncements - In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, “Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Statements” (“ASU 2016-13”). ASU 2016-13 requires a financial asset (or a group of financial assets) measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation amount that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset(s) to present the net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected on the financial asset. In November 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-19, “Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses,” which clarifies ASC Topic 326, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses” and corrects unintended application of the guidance, and in November 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-11, “Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses,” which clarifies or addresses specific issues about certain aspects of ASU 2016-13. In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-03, “Codification Improvements to Financial Instruments,” which modifies the measurement of expected credit losses of certain financial instruments. ASU 2016-13 is effective for certain smaller reporting companies for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022 and interim periods within those fiscal years, which will be fiscal 2023 for the Company if it continues to be classified as a smaller reporting company, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect that the adoption of the new guidance will have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. ​ ​ 2. Property and equipment Property and equipment, which include amounts recorded under capital leases, are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization (in thousands), and consist of the following: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ December 31, ​ 2022 2021 Equipment ​ $ 12,391 ​ $ 12,834 Computer software ​ 4,447 ​ 4,399 Furniture and equipment ​ 1,163 ​ 1,397 Leasehold improvements ​ 2,554 ​ 3,287 Total ​ 20,555 ​ 21,917 Less: accumulated depreciation and amortization ​ ( 18,044 ) ​ ( 18,970 ) ​ ​ $ 2,511 ​ $ 2,947 ​ The estimated useful lives of the property and equipment range between two years and ten years . Depreciation and amortization expense of property and equipment were approximately $ 1.2 and $ 0.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. ​ 3. Goodwill and Intangible Assets The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2022 were as follows (in thousands): ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Balance as of January 1, 2022 $ 2,143 Foreign currency translation adjustment ​ ( 105 ) Balance as of December 31, 2022 ​ $ 2,038 ​ As of September 30, 2022, the Company performed its annual goodwill impairment analysis on one of its reporting units, the Agility segment. The Company also tested the intangible assets of the Agility and Synodex segments for impairment. The impairment test involves estimating the fair value based on a combination of income (estimates of future discounted cash flows) and the market approach (market multiples for similar companies) using unobservable inputs (Level 3). The income approach uses a discounted cash flow (“DCF”) method that utilizes the present value of cash flows to estimate the segment’s fair value. The future cash flows of the segment were projected based on the Company’s estimates of future revenue, operating income, and other factors such as working capital and capital expenditures. As part of the DCF analysis, the Company projected revenue and operating profits and assumed long-term revenue growth rates in the terminal year. The market approach utilizes multiples of revenues and earnings before interest expense, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (“EBITDA”) to estimate the segment’s fair value. The market multiples used for the segment were based on a group of comparable companies’ market multiples applied to the Company’s revenue. The Company concluded that there is no impairment of goodwill or intangible assets for the Agility segment, and no impairment of intangible assets for the Synodex segments. F-14 Table of Contents INNODATA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The fair value measurement of goodwill for the Agility segment was classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy because the Company used the income approach, which utilizes significant inputs that are unobservable in the market and the market multiple approaches using comparable entities to further validate the carrying values. The Company believes it made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of the reporting unit as of the impairment test measurement date. The carrying value of Goodwill was $ 2.0 and $ 2.1 million as of December 31, 2022, and 2021.

The ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences are deductible and net operating losses are available. As of December 31, 2022, the Company continues to maintain a valuation allowance on all of the Company’s United States, Canadian, German and United Kingdom subsidiaries’ deferred tax assets. The Company maintained a valuation allowance of approximately $ 13.0 million and $ 9.1 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The valuation allowance relates to United States, and the Company’s Canadian, German and the United Kingdom subsidiaries’ deferred tax assets. The net change in the total valuation allowance was an increase of $ 3.9 million and $ 1.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Despite the access to the overseas earnings and the resulting toll charge, the Company intends to indefinitely reinvest the foreign earnings in our foreign subsidiaries on account of the foreign jurisdiction withholding tax that the Company has to incur on the actual remittances. Unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries amounted to approximately $ 50.9 million at December 31, 2022. If such earnings are repatriated in the future, or are no longer deemed to be indefinitely reinvested, the Company would have to accrue the applicable amount of foreign jurisdiction withholding taxes associated with such remittances.

AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS At December 31, 2022, the Company had available U.S. federal net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards of approximately $ 20.5 million. These NOL carryforwards expire at various times through the year 2035. The potential benefits from these balances have not been recognized for financial statement purposes. Under the CARES Act, the Internal Revenue Code was amended to allow for federal NOL carrybacks for five years to offset previous years’ taxable income or for the NOL to be carried forward indefinitely to offset 80% of taxable income for tax years 2021 and thereafter. As of the date the financial statements were issued, the state NOL carryforwards, if not utilized, will expire beginning in 2031. On December 31, 2022, the Company’s Canadian subsidiaries had available Canadian NOL carryforwards of approximately $ 28.3 million which will begin to expire in 2036. The potential benefits from these balances have not been recognized for financial statement purposes. On December 31, 2022, the Company’s German and the United Kingdom subsidiaries had available NOL carryforwards of approximately $ 2.2 million. The potential benefits from these balances have not been recognized for financial statement purposes. The Company had unrecognized tax benefits of $ 1.7 million and $ 1.8 million as of December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The decrease in unrecognized tax benefits resulted from the reversal of a prior year’s accrual due to tax settlements. The Company expects that unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, if recognized, would have a material impact on the Company’s effective tax rate. The Company is subject to Federal income tax, as well as income tax in various states and foreign jurisdictions. The Company has open tax years for U.S. Federal and state taxes from 2017 through 2021. Various foreign subsidiaries have open tax years from 2004 through 2022, some of which are under audit by local tax authorities. The Company believes that its accruals for uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2022 under ASC 740, Income Taxes are adequate to cover the Company’s income tax exposures.

The Company disagrees with the Service Tax Department’s position. In November 2019, the Commissioner of Central Tax, GST & Central Excise issued an order confirming the Service Tax Department’s position. The Company is contesting this order in an appeal to the Customs, Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal. In the event the Service Tax Department is ultimately successful in proving that the services fall under the category of OID Services, the revenues earned by the Company’s Indian subsidiary for the period July 2012 through November 2016 would be subject to a service tax of between 12.36 % and 15 %, and this subsidiary may also be liable for interest and penalties. The revenue of the Company’s Indian subsidiary during this period was approximately $ 57.0 million. In accordance with new rules promulgated by the Service Tax Department, as of December 1, 2016 service tax is no longer applicable to OID or BS Services. Based on the Company’s assessment in consultation with the Company’s tax counsel, the Company has not recorded any tax liability for this case. F-18 Table of Contents INNODATA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS In a separate action relating to service tax refunds, in October 2016, the Company’s Indian subsidiary received notices from the Indian Service Tax Department in India seeking to reverse service tax refunds of approximately $ 121,000 previously granted to the Company’s Indian subsidiary for three quarters in 2014, asserting that the services provided by this subsidiary fall under the category of OID Services and not BS Services. The appeal was determined in favor of the Service Tax Department. The Company disagrees with the basis of this decision and is contesting it. The Company expects delays in its Indian subsidiary receiving further service tax refunds until this matter is adjudicated with finality, and currently has service tax credits of approximately $ 0.8 million recorded as a receivable. Based on the Company’s assessment in consultation with the Company’s tax counsel, the Company has not recorded any tax liability for this case. Substantial recovery against the Company in the above referenced 2015 Service Tax Department case could have a material adverse impact on the Company, and unfavorable rulings or recoveries in other tax proceedings could have a material adverse impact on the consolidated operating results of the period (and subsequent periods) in which the rulings or recovery occurs. ​ 5.

Commitments and contingencies Litigation - In 2008, a judgment was rendered in the Philippines against a Philippine subsidiary of the Company that is no longer active and purportedly also against Innodata Inc., in favor of certain former employees of the Philippine subsidiary. The potential payment amount aggregates to approximately $ 5.9 million, plus legal interest that accrued at 12% per annum from August 13, 2008 to June 30, 2013, and thereafter accrued and continues to accrue at 6% per annum . The potential payment amount as expressed in U.S. dollars varies with the Philippine peso to U.S. dollar exchange rate. In December 2017, a group of 97 of the former employees of the Philippine subsidiary indicated that they proposed to record the judgment as to themselves in New Jersey. In January 2018, in response to an action initiated by Innodata Inc., the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey (“USDC”) entered a preliminary injunction that enjoins these former employees from pursuing or seeking recognition or enforcement of the judgment against Innodata Inc. in the U.S. during the pendency of the action and until further order of the USDC. In June 2018, the USDC entered a consent order administratively closing the action subject to return of the action to the active docket upon the written request of Innodata Inc. or the former employees, with the USDC retaining jurisdiction over the matter and the preliminary injunction remaining in full force and effect. The Company is also subject to various other legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. While management currently believes that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position or overall trends in consolidated results of operations, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties. Substantial recovery against the Company in the above-referenced Philippine action could have a material adverse impact on the Company, and unfavorable rulings or recoveries in the other proceedings could have a material adverse impact on the consolidated operating results in the period in which the ruling or recovery occurs. In addition, the Company’s estimate of the potential impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position or overall consolidated results of operations for the above referenced legal proceedings could change in the future. F-19 Table of Contents INNODATA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Company’s legal accruals related to legal proceedings and claims are based on the Company’s determination of whether or not a loss is probable. The Company reviews outstanding proceedings and claims with external counsel to assess probability and estimates of loss. The accruals are adjusted if necessary. While the Company intends to defend these matters vigorously, adverse outcomes that it estimates could reach approximately $ 450,000 in the aggregate beyond recorded amounts are reasonably possible. If circumstances change, the Company may be required to record adjustments that could be material to its reported consolidated financial condition and results of operations. Foreign Currency - To the extent that the currencies of the Company’s production facilities located in the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka and Israel fluctuate, the Company is subject to risks of changing costs of production after pricing is established for certain customer projects. In addition, the Company is exposed to the risk of foreign currency fluctuation on the non-U.S. dollar denominated revenues, and on the monetary assets and liabilities held by its foreign subsidiaries that are denominated in local currency. Indemnifications - The Company is obligated under certain circumstances to indemnify directors, officers and certain employees against costs and liabilities incurred in actions or threatened actions brought against such individuals because such individuals acted in the capacity of director, officer or fiduciary of the Company. In addition, the Company has contracts with certain customers pursuant to which the Company has agreed to indemnify the customer for certain specified and limited claims. These indemnification obligations occur in the ordinary course of business and, in many cases, do not include a limit on potential maximum future payments. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has not recorded a liability for any obligations arising as a result of these indemnification obligations. ​ 7. Operating Leases The Company has various lease agreements for its offices and service delivery centers. The Company has determined that the risks and benefits related to the leased properties are retained by the lessors. Accordingly, these are accounted for as operating leases. These lease agreements are for terms ranging from two to eleven years and, in most cases, provide for rental escalations ranging from 1.75 % to 10 %. Most of these agreements are renewable at the mutual consent of the parties to the contract. The Company recognizes an operating lease liability and right-of-use asset in compliance with current lease accounting standard ASC 842. The amount of right-of use asset is equal to the present value of the remaining lease payments discounted using the incremental borrowing rate of each respective country. Modifications, if any are recalculated and corresponding adjustments are made to the carrying values of both the lease liability and right-of-use assets. A right-of-use asset is measured as the amount of the lease liability adjusted for the amount of deferred straight-line rent, prepaid rent and lease incentive allowances previously recognized. ​ The table below summarizes the amounts recognized in the financial statements related to operating leases for the years presented (in thousands): ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Year Ended ​ December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Rent expense for long-term operating leases ​ $ 1,336 ​ $ 1,560 Rent expense for short-term leases ​ 502 ​ 229 Total rent expense ​ $ 1,838 ​ $ 1,789 ​ F-20 Table of Contents INNODATA INC.

Pension Benefits U.S. Defined Contribution Pension Plan - The Company has a defined contribution plan qualified under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, pursuant to which substantially all of its U.S. employees are eligible to participate after completing six months of service. Participants may elect to contribute a portion of their compensation to the plan. Under the plan, the Company has the discretion to match a portion of participants’ contributions. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company did not make any matching contributions. Most of the non-U.S. subsidiaries provide for government-mandated defined pension benefits. For certain of these subsidiaries, vested eligible employees are provided a lump sum payment upon retiring from the Company at a defined age. The lump sum amount is based on the salary and tenure as of retirement date. Other non-U.S. subsidiaries provide for a lump sum payment to vested employees on retirement, death, incapacitation or termination of employment, based upon the salary and tenure as of the date employment ceases. The liability for such defined benefit obligations is determined and provided on the basis of actuarial valuations. As of December 31, 2022, these plans were unfunded. Pension expense for foreign subsidiaries totaled approximately $ 1.1 million and $ 0.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The following tables set out the status of the non-U.S. pension benefits and the amounts recognized in the Company’s consolidated financial statements and the components of pension costs as of and for each of the two years in the period ended December 31 (in thousands): F-21 Table of Contents INNODATA INC.

This was mainly due to changes in the discount rates used. Actuarial (gains) losses are recorded as part of other comprehensive income and is not reflected as part of net periodic pension cost. ​ Components of Net Periodic Pension Cost: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 2022 2021 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Service cost ​ $ 592 ​ $ 572 Interest cost ​ 352 ​ 247 Curtailment ​ ( 16 ) ​ - Actuarial loss recognized ​ 210 ​ 47 Net periodic pension cost ​ $ 1,138 ​ $ 866 ​ The accumulated benefit obligation, which represents benefits earned to date, was approximately $ 3.2 and $ 3.7 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.

Stock Options On June 7, 2016, stockholders of the Company approved amendments to the Innodata Inc. 2013 Stock Plan (as amended, the “2013 Plan”). The number of shares of common stock of Innodata Inc. that may be delivered, purchased or used for reference purposes (with respect to stock appreciation rights or stock units) for awards granted under the 2013 Plan after June 7, 2016 is 5,858,892 (the “Share Reserve”). Shares subject to an option or stock appreciation right granted under the 2013 Plan after June 7, 2016 count against the Share Reserve as one share for every share granted, and shares subject to any other type of award granted under the 2013 Plan after June 7, 2016 count against the Share Reserve as two shares for every share granted. Any award, or portion of an award, under the 2013 Plan or under the Company’s 2009 Stock Plan (as amended and restated (the Prior Plan)) that expires or terminates unexercised, becomes unexercisable or is forfeited or otherwise terminated, surrendered or canceled as to any shares without delivery of shares or other consideration will be added back to the Share Reserve as one share for each such share that was subject to an option or stock appreciation right granted under the 2013 Plan or the Prior Plan, and two shares for each such share that was subject to an award other than an option or stock appreciation right granted under the 2013 Plan or the Prior Plan. If any shares are withheld, tendered or exchanged by a participant in the 2013 Plan as full or partial payment to Innodata of the exercise price under an option under the 2013 Plan or the Prior Plan or in satisfaction of a participant’s tax withholding obligations with respect to any award under the 2013 Plan or the Prior Plan, there will be added back to the Share Reserve one share for each such share that was withheld, tendered or exchanged in respect of an option or stock appreciation right granted under the 2013 Plan or the Prior Plan, and two shares for each such share that was withheld, tendered or exchanged in respect of an award other than an option or stock appreciation right granted under the 2013 Plan or the Prior Plan. F-23 Table of Contents INNODATA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS On June 9, 2022, stockholders of the Company approved amendments to the Innodata Inc. 2021 Equity Compensation Plan (as amended, the “2021 Plan”). The number of shares of common stock of Innodata Inc. that may be delivered, purchased or used for reference purposes (with respect to stock appreciation rights or stock units) for awards granted under the 2021 Plan is 4,000,000 (the “Share Reserve”). Shares subject to an option or stock appreciation right granted under the 2021 Plan count against the Share Reserve as one share for every share granted, and shares subject to any other type of award granted under the 2021 Plan count against the Share Reserve as two shares for every share granted for awards granted prior to April 11, 2022, and one and a half shares for every share granted for awards granted on or after April 11, 2022. Any shares withheld, tendered or exchanged by a participant in the 2021 Plan as full or partial payment to Innodata of the exercise price under an option under the 2021 Plan or in satisfaction of a participant’s tax withholding obligations with respect to any award under the 2021 Plan, will not be added back to the Share Reserve. The fair value of stock options is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The weighted-average fair value of the options granted, and weighted-average assumptions were as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ For the Years Ended December 31, ​ ​ 2022 ​ 2021 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Weighted average fair value of options granted $ 2.67 $ 3.73 ​ Risk-free interest rate ​ 1.94 % - 4.09 % 0.22 % - 0.82 % Expected life (years) ​ 3 - 6.42 ​ 3 - 6 ​ Expected volatility factor ​ 62 %- 79 % 58 % - 68 % Expected dividends ​ None ​ None ​ ​ The Company estimates the risk-free interest rate using the U.S. Treasury yield curve for periods equal to the expected term of the options in effect at the time of grant. The expected term of options granted is based on a combination of vesting schedules, term of the options and historical experience. Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the Company’s common stock. The Company uses an expected dividend yield of zero since it has never declared or paid any dividends on its capital stock.

Each RSU has vesting conditions based on both the achievement of performance-based metrics and the continuation of employment over a defined period. The level of performance determines the number of RSUs that performance-vest, and performance vested RSUs must also time-vest in order to be fully vested. Each fully vested RSU represents the right to receive one share of the Company’s common stock or the fair market value of one share of common stock, at the Company’s discretion, and is classified as an equity award. Each RSU vests pursuant to the vesting schedule found in the respective RSU agreement. RSUs are generally subject to graduated vesting schedules and stock-based compensation expense is computed by tranche and recognized on a straight-line basis over the tranches’ applicable vesting period based on the expected achievement level. The fair value of restricted stock units is estimated on the date of grant using the Binomial option pricing model. ​ F-25 Table of Contents INNODATA INC.

Loss per Share ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ For the Years Ended ​ ​ December 31, ​ 2022 2021 Net loss attributable to Innodata Inc. and Subsidiaries ​ $ ( 11,935 ) $ ( 1,673 ) Weighted average common shares outstanding ​ 27,278 ​ 26,630 Dilutive effect of outstanding options ​ - ​ ​ - Adjusted for dilutive computation ​ 27,278 ​ 26,630 ​ Basic loss per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted income per share is computed by considering the impact of the potential issuance of common shares, using the treasury stock method, on the weighted average number of shares outstanding. For those securities that are not convertible into a class of common stock, the two-class method of computing loss per share is used. Options to purchase 5.3 million shares of common stock for the year ended December 31, 2022 were outstanding but not included in the computation of diluted loss per share because the exercise price of the options were greater than the average market price of the common shares and therefore have not been considered as potential equity shares. ​ Options to purchase 5.5 million shares of common stock for the year ended December 31, 2021, were outstanding but not included in the computation of diluted income per share because the exercise price of the options were greater than the average market price of the common shares and therefore have not been considered as potential equity shares. ​ 14. Derivatives The Company conducts a large portion of its operations in international markets which subject it to foreign currency fluctuations. The most significant foreign currency exposures occur when revenue and associated accounts receivable are collected in one currency and expenses to generate that revenue are incurred in another currency. The Company is also subject to wage inflation and other government mandated increases and operating expenses in Asian countries where the Company has the majority of its operations. The Company’s primary inflation and exchange rate exposure relates to payroll, other payroll costs and operating expenses in the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka and Israel. In addition, although most of the Company’s revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars, a significant portion of total revenues is denominated in Canadian dollars, Pound Sterling and Euros. The Company’s policy is to enter derivative instrument contracts with terms that coincide with the underlying exposure being hedged for a period up to 12 months. As such, the Company’s derivative instruments are expected to be highly effective. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the entire change in fair value of the hedging instrument is recorded to Other comprehensive income (loss). Upon settlement of these contracts, the change in the fair value recorded in Other comprehensive income (loss) are reclassified to earnings and included as part of Direct operating costs. For derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, any change in fair value is recorded directly in earnings as part of Direct operating costs. The Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking hedge transactions. The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. All derivatives are recognized at their fair value and classified based on the instrument’s maturity date. The total notional amount for outstanding derivatives designated as hedges was $ 14.2 million as of December 31, 2022. F-30 Table of Contents INNODATA INC.

The Company accounted for the transaction in accordance with ASC Topic 810, “Consolidation,” which discusses the proper accounting treatment of the carrying value for the non-controlling interest. Under the standard, any change in ownership that does not result in a loss of control must be accounted for as an equity transaction. ​ 16.

Business. Business Overview Innodata Inc. (NASDAQ: INOD) (including its subsidiaries, the “Company”, “Innodata”, “we”, “us” or “our”) is a global data engineering company. Our mission is to deliver the promise of AI to the world’s most prestigious companies. We provide AI-enabled software platforms and managed services to companies that require high-quality data for training AI and machine learning (ML) algorithms. We also provide AI digital transformation solutions and platforms to help companies apply AI/ML to real-world problems relating to analyzing and deriving insights from documents. For industry-specific, document-intensive industry business processes, we provide AI-augmented software-as-a-service (SaaS) platforms and discrete managed services. Our platforms and services are powered by Goldengate, our proprietary AI/ML platform, as well as other technologies we have developed. In addition, we bring to bear more than 4,500 employees spanning eight countries with expertise in data pertaining to many professional fields. Our hybrid approach of using AI/ML in conjunction with human experts enables us to deliver superior data quality with even the most complex and sensitive data. We developed our capabilities and honed our customer- and quality-centric culture progressively over the last 30 years creating high-quality data for many of the world’s most demanding information companies. Approximately six years ago, we formed Innodata Labs, a research and development center, to research, develop and apply machine learning and emerging AI to our large-scale, human-intensive data operations. In 2019, we began packaging the capabilities that emerged from our R&D efforts in order to align with several fast-growing new markets and help companies use AI/ML to drive performance benefits and business insights. We anticipate this strategy will enable us to accelerate growth. Market Opportunities AI Data Annotation Companies across industry verticals are increasingly seeking to develop AI-based applications for an ever-increasing variety of use cases such as self-driving cars, surveillance systems, automated medical diagnostics, digital assistants and chatbots, content moderation, robotics and contract review. These applications depend upon high-performing AI algorithms in areas such as speech recognition, image recognition, and text recognition. Unlike traditional computer applications that are programmed in languages like Python and Java to tell computers what to do, AI applications can be created with little to no programming. Instead, AI applications are trained with large quantities of input data and expected output data. Leveraging such data, the AI application learns on its own from the data itself through a series of regressions. Developing high-quality training data is critical for the AI to perform correctly, but often requires technology and skilled human resources that data science teams lack. Moreover, developing high-quality data takes up 80% of the time for most AI and ML projects. 1 We train AI algorithms for social media companies, robotics companies, financial services companies, and many others, working with images, text, video and audio. Data sciences teams seek partners that can perform data preparation functions for them at large-scale and at high quality, while using automated tools to minimize cost. Moreover, as AI projects become more specialized and mission-critical, data preparation is becoming increasingly complex, requiring deep domain knowledge and an infrastructure in which data security is assured. We believe that Innodata is ideally situated to be such a partner. We utilize a variety of leading third-party image and video annotation tools. For text, we use our proprietary data annotation platform that incorporates AI to reduce cost while improving consistency and quality of output. Our proprietary text annotation platform features auto-tagging capabilities that apply to both classical and generative AI tasks. It also encapsulates many of the innovations we have conceived of in the course of our 30-year history of creating high-quality data. In November 2021 we announced the general availability of our text annotation platform for customer use which we anticipate will be a source of competitive differentiation and SaaS licensing revenue. The AI data training market is expected to grow to $3.5 billion by the end of 2024, 2 essentially proxying the enormous growth expected in AI system spending overall ($85.3 billion in 2021, $204 billion in 2025, a 24.5% CAGR). 3 Similarly, the global data annotation tools market was valued at $695 million in 2019, projected to reach $6.5 billion by 2027, which is a CAGR of 33%. 4 1 Data Preparation & Labeling for AI 2020 , Cognilytica Research (Jan. 31, 2020) 2 Data Preparation & Labeling for AI 2020 , Cognilytica Research (Jan. 31, 2020) 3 Worldwide Artificial Intelligence Systems Spending Guide, IDC (Aug. 30, 2021) 4 Data Annotation Tools Market to 2027 - Global Analysis and Forecasts by Type; Annotation Type; End-user , ReportLinker , (Mar. 2020) 4 Table of Contents AI Digital Transformation We also provide AI solutions and platforms to companies that intensively process textual data and seek to obtain the benefits of AI/ML technologies without having to develop AI/ML engineering capabilities in-house. For such companies, we often integrate one or more of our pre-trained text processing algorithms as a foundation for an overall solution. Our algorithms are accessible as microservices via application programming interfaces (APIs), enabling easy integration. In conjunction with AI digital transformation, we often provide a range of data engineering support services, including data transformation, data curation, data hygiene, data consolidation, data compliance, and master data management. Our customers span a diverse range of industries and a wide range of AI use cases, benefiting from the short time-to-value and high economic returns our AI digital transformation solutions and platforms offer. The document analytics market - a subset of the overall AI market - is expected to grow at a CAGR of 48.1% from 2020 to 2027, reaching $12.45 billion by 2027. 5 Meanwhile, overall enterprise AI spend is projected to reach $53.06 billion by 2026, registering a CAGR of 35.4% from 2019 to 2026. 6 Industry AI Platforms Our industry platforms address specific, niche market requirements that we believe we can fulfill in large part with our AI/ML technologies. We deploy these industry platforms as software-as-a-service (SaaS) and as managed services. To date, we have built an industry platform for medical records data extraction and transformation (which we brand as “Synodex ® ”) and an industry platform for public relations (which we brand as “Agility PR Solutions”). Our Synodex industry platform transforms medical records into useable digital data organized in accordance with our proprietary data models or customer data models. At the end of 2021, we had 18 customers utilizing our Synodex platform, including John Hancock Insurance, the insurance operating unit of John Hancock Financial (a division of Manulife) and one of the largest life insurers in the United States. As we further integrate AI into the platform, we aim to address the needs of the healthcare sector, which is increasingly seeking to search, analyze, and interpret vast volumes of patient data, improve clinical documentation and make computer-assisted coding more efficient. The global artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare market is forecast to reach a market size of $67.4 billion by 2027, up from $6.9 billion in 2021, with a CAGR of 46.2%. 7 Our Agility industry platform provides marketing communications and public relations professionals with the ability to target and distribute content to journalists and social media influencers world-wide and to monitor and analyze global news (print, web, radio and TV) and social media. Agility is now ranked by software review site G2 Crowd as meeting the requirements of customers better than its two largest competitors that have combined revenues of over $1 billion. 8 Agility operates in the $4.8 billion media intelligence solutions market. 9 The Company’s operations are presently classified and reported in three reporting segments: Digital Data Solutions (DDS), Synodex and Agility. 5 Document Analytics Market by Product Type (Solution and Services), Deployment Type, Industry Vertical (BFSI, Government, Healthcare, Retail and ecommerce, Manufacturing, Transportation), Organization Size, and Region - Global Forecast to 2027 , Meticulous Research ® , (Mar. 2021) 6 Enterprise Artificial Intelligence (AI) Market Outlook-2026 , Allied Market Research (2020) 7 Artificial Intelligence In Healthcare Market By Offering (Hardware, Software), By Technology (Machine Learning, Context-Aware Computing, Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision), By End-Use (Hospitals & Healthcare Providers), and Region Forecast To 2027 , Markets and Markets Research Private Ltd .(Oct. 2021) 8 https://www.agilitypr.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/G2-Comparison.pdf 9 Strong Growth in Spending on Media Intelligence Software & Information – Burton-Taylor Report , Burton-Taylor International Consulting , (Apr. 27, 2021) ​ 5 Table of Contents Competitive Strengths Our Data Quality We believe we achieve industry-leading data quality by leveraging our technology, our large staff of human experts, and the culture we have cultivated over many years of providing high-quality data to the most demanding customers. For the past six years, we have been designing and refining our approach for combining human experts and AI to produce large-scale, highly accurate data. In our approach, AI networks automatically perform much of the required processing and human experts perform processing that the AI cannot perform at a high level of confidence. The human output is fed back into the AI networks, which, as a result, “learn” and become “smarter” over time, achieving progressively greater levels of automation while maintaining the highest levels of quality. ( See “Our Technology”, below .) Our 4,000+ experts have deep domain knowledge in a wide diversity of data domains. They are selected on the basis of data acumen, analytical ability, and deep domain proficiency. ( See “Our Domain Experts”, below .) Our culture of quality is critical to achieving and sustaining high data quality. Our culture has been cultivated over our decades of experience performing data-related tasks for leading global companies, including the four largest global information companies with which we have 10-plus year relationships building and maintaining many of their leading data products. We maintain independent quality assurance centers that comply with the ISO 9001:2008 quality management system standards. Our Domain Experts We have over 4,000 employees with deep data domain expertise in various fields, including law, sciences, health, finance, and technology. Many of them hold advanced degrees. They process data in over 25 languages. For annotating complex or sensitive data, our expert staff provides an attractive alternative to the crowdsourced labor pools utilized by many of our competitors typically for mundane tasks. They are especially well-suited for high-context data, such as legal contract classification, medical images, medical records, and scientific and legal literature. Our Technology Over the past five years, we have built a technology infrastructure that automates complex data annotation and other data engineering tasks. Our technology infrastructure combines advanced dataflow, deep learning (a branch of AI), and purpose-built applications used by human experts, which we refer to as “workbenches”. This infrastructure enables us to perform data annotation and other data engineering tasks at progressively higher levels of efficiency without compromising quality as it continuously learns from human experts. Our proprietary, state-of-the-art Goldengate platform is our core AI technology stack. Goldengate accepts a wide range of documents – including images, PDFs, and web copy – and performs a series of cognitive tasks to extract intelligence and create analytical data that people can use for generating inferences and powering analytical applications. It serves up no-code AI with transfer learning built on generative language models we have developed over the past six years of deploying industrial deep neural networks. Goldengate serves as the foundational technology for the AI projects we perform for customers, as well as the AI-under-the-hood that powers our data annotation platform and our industry platforms. One of the main benefits of the platform is that it’s “no-code”, so it doesn’t require a large number of data scientists to build models or require a data science platform to orchestrate models and update models. Using Goldengate in combination with our SMEs, we are able to build high-performing, cutting-edge models that address real-world problems. In 2021 we further AI-enabled Synodex, Agility and our data annotation platform using Goldengate; in 2022, we intend to commercialize it further as both a customer-facing technology and as the engine under other potential industry solutions. Goldengate functionality can be consumed as domain-specific and task-specific microservices each of which performs a discrete data-related task automatically. Each AI microservice may be invoked by the dataflow via a RESTful API. Many complex data problems can be solved with a combination of these microservices. Capabilities include deep sequence labelling, categorization, segmentation and sequence-to-sequence mapping. For each cognitive task an AI microservice performs, it provides a confidence score. A confidence score at or above an established accuracy threshold means no human expert review is required. A confidence score below an established accuracy threshold means human expert review is required. When expert review is required, the dataflow automatically routes data to an appropriate human expert. Our human experts use workbenches that enable them to quickly and efficiently review the data and make judgements. The workbenches then retroactively feed 6 Table of Contents back the expert-reviewed work into Goldengate’s deep neural network, enabling it to learn and become smarter. This feature is commonly known as “human-in-the-loop”. It results in continuous, predictable improvement and progressively greater levels of automation. To support our Agility industry platform, we have built a fully scalable, cloud-based infrastructure that powers a SaaS experience for global customers on a 24/7 basis. It includes (i) an AI/ML-powered big data media intelligence platform that indexes two billion media items per year, powering media monitoring, media enrichment, and media database APIs; (ii) a full targeting workflow platform that integrates media targeting, content curation, content distribution, integrated newswires, and a newsroom; (iii) a comprehensive database of more than one million global media influencers and journalists; (iv) a media monitoring and analytics engine; and (v) a workflow platform for media database research combining AI and machine learning to streamline research workflows for discovery and maintenance of our database. To support our Synodex industry platform, we have built technologies for transforming imaged medical records and HL7/FHIR electronic health records (EHR) systems into digital data conforming to proprietary insurance medical data dictionaries that span diseases and impairments, diagnostic tests, pharmacology and support industry standard codes such as ICD-10 as well as rules engines for processing, analyzing and displaying the digital data. Our Infrastructure Our infrastructure supports a range of strategies to suit our customers’ requirements for data security, compliance, scalability and reliability. Our user endpoints are secured with cloud-managed security solutions consisting of firewall, IDS/IPS, vulnerability scanning and patch management engines. We host data and applications in our own data centers at our operations centers, in our customers’ data centers, and on third-party cloud services that provide the benefit of “infinite scalability” of hardware resources. Our data operations are linked by multiple redundant network connections. Our Wide Area Network – along with our Local Area Networks, Storage Area Networks, Network Attached Storage and data centers – are configured with industry standard redundancy, often with more than one backup to establish 24x7 availability. In 2021, our Wide Area Network had 99.96% uptime excluding scheduled maintenance. We encrypt all sensitive information, both at rest and in transit, to the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 256 or similar standard, and we employ a range of security features, including industry-leading managed firewalls and intrusion detection and prevention services. ( See “Information Security”, below. ) Our Breath of Capabilities We are able to address customers at their highest point of need. For example, we may provide data annotation for a data sciences team at a bank that is building an AI application to manage complex loan agreements. For another banking customer with the same requirement but without a sophisticated data sciences team, we might provide a full AI/ML solution built on our proprietary Goldengate AI platform that extracts key data points from the loan agreements and outputs normalized digital data via an API to the bank’s existing application. For still another banking customer that also lacked such an application, we might provide a data analytics platform. Data science teams that utilize our data annotation services also often have other related needs that include data transformation, data curation, data hygiene, data consolidation, data compliance, and master data management. Unlike many of our data annotation competitors – that are essentially staffing companies – as a full-service data engineering company we are able to address these attendant requirements. Our Outcomes Orientation We have developed a strong customer-centric culture and a set of values designed around achieving promised outcomes for our customers. This includes proactive communication, innovation, transparency, and empathy. Growth Strategy Our strategy for growth is to align to and serve large, dynamic and rapidly growing markets related to the deployment of AI/ML in businesses. Our solutions and platforms leverage the technology, human resources, and culture of fanaticism for data quality that we have developed over the past 30 years, as well as the AI/ML research and development we have invested in over the past six years. We intend to invest significantly in scaling our sales and marketing. In 2021 we expanded our sales force by close to 400%, ending 2021 with a sales team of 115. We expect this will deliver significant returns in future years. 7 Table of Contents We also plan to continue to invest in our proprietary Goldengate AI/ML platform and in the continued development of new SaaS platforms as sources of competitive advantage. We have also invested in building a proprietary resource management platform geared specifically to managing remote staff and freelancers. Prior to the global pandemic, our operating model was to almost exclusively use full-time employees working from large production centers. Propelled by the need to shift to remote working, we are presently near 100% cloud-based and remote, which has enabled us to lower fixed operating costs and achieve greater scalability. We expect to fully fund these investments for growth from our internal resources without need for outside financing. Our Customers Our customers include leading businesses across multiple verticals including banking, insurance, financial services, technology, digital retailing and information/media. One customer in the DDS segment generated approximately 11% and 14% of the Company’s total revenues in the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of total revenues during these periods. Further, in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, revenues from non-U.S. customers accounted for 45% and 54%, respectively, of the Company’s revenues. We have long-standing relationships with many of our customers, and we have provided services to the customer referenced in the preceding paragraph for over ten years. Our track record of delivering high-quality services helps us to solidify customer relationships. Many of our customers are recurring customers, meaning that they have continued to provide additional projects to us after our initial engagement with them. Our agreements with our customers are in many cases terminable on 30 to 90 days’ notice. A substantial portion of the services we provide to our customers is subject to their requirements. Sales and Marketing We market and sell our solutions and platforms directly through our professional staff, senior management and direct sales personnel operating primarily from various locations in the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom and Europe. In addition, we are increasingly developing and expanding our use of strategic partnerships and channel relationships for the establishment and development of new and existing customers. In addition to our executive-level business development professionals and sales and marketing personnel, we also deploy solutions architects, technical support experts and consultants who support the development of new customers and new customer engagements. These resources work within teams (both permanent and ad hoc) that provide support to customers. Our marketing department and sales professionals work together to generate leads. Our sales professionals identify and qualify prospects, securing direct personal access to decision makers at existing and prospective customers. They facilitate interactions between customer personnel and our service teams to define ways in which we can assist customers with their goals. For each prospective customer engagement, we assemble a team of our senior employees drawn from various disciplines within our Company. The team members assume assigned roles in a formalized process, using their combined knowledge and experience to understand the customer’s goals and collaborate with the customer on a solution. Our marketing organization is responsible for developing and increasing the visibility and awareness of our brand and our service offerings, defining and communicating our value proposition, generating qualified, early-stage leads and furnishing effective sales support tools. As part of our marketing strategy, we partner with media organizations to build awareness, establish a reputation as an industry thought leader and generate leads. Media partners include trade associations and publications, trade show producers and consulting organizations. These partnerships are particularly valuable in enterprise industries as we build our presence among digital content leaders and decision makers. Primary marketing outreach activities include content marketing, event marketing (including exhibiting at trade shows, virtual summits, conferences and seminars), direct and database marketing, public and media relations (including speaking engagements), and web marketing (including integrated marketing campaigns, search engine optimization, search engine marketing and the maintenance and continued development of external websites). 8 Table of Contents Sales activities include lead generation, nurturing leads, engaging in discussions with prospective customers to understand their needs, demonstrating our products, designing solutions, responding to requests for proposals, and managing account and customer relationships and activities. Personnel from our solutions analysis group, our customer services group and our engineering services group closely support our direct sales effort. These individuals assist the sales force in understanding the technical needs of customers and providing responses to these needs, including demonstrations, prototypes, pricing quotations and time estimates. In addition, account managers from our customer service group support our direct sales effort by providing ongoing project-level support to our customers. Competition Major competitors across industry verticals include Amazon Sagemaker Ground Truth, Appen, CloudFactory, Defined Crowd, Deepen.ai, Lionbridge, Samasource, Scale AI, several of which are large firms with established client bases, as well as technology service providers such as Cognizant Technology Solutions, ExlService Holdings, Inc., Genpact Limited, Infosys, and Tata Consultancy Services. We compete in the data engineering market by offering high-quality services and competitive pricing that leverage our technical platforms, IT infrastructure, offshore domain experts and economies of scale. Our competitive advantages are especially attractive to customers for undertakings that are complex, mission-critical, sizable in scope or scale, or that require high levels of information security. Each of our industry platforms has its discrete set of competitors. Major competitors for our Synodex industry platform are Risk Righter, eNoah, Parameds, Aosta and a few BPO companies, several of which are large firms with established customer bases. We also compete with in-house personnel at existing or prospective customers who may attempt to duplicate our services in-house or use alternative approaches to fulfill their needs. Our Agility industry platform competes with Meltwater, Cision, Kantar, and Intrado, several of which are large firms with established customer bases, as well as PR firms that provide media monitoring and analysis services and journalist and influencer databases. Our competitors also include social media listening companies and start-ups offering platforms to amplify messages by targeting social media influencers.

Innodata enters into confidentiality agreements with its employees, contractors and customers, and limits access to and distribution of Innodata’s and Innodata’s customers’ proprietary information. Innodata cannot assure that these arrangements will be adequate to deter misappropriation of its proprietary information or that it will be able to detect unauthorized use and take appropriate steps to enforce its intellectual property rights. Information Security Our operations facilities in Asia and our data centers are certified to information security management standard - ISO27001:2013. We have deployed multi-layered security consisting of a wide range of security controls and measures such as two-factor authentication, patch management, full disk encryption system, anti-virus with firewall and IDS/IPS capability, redundant next generation firewalls with intrusion detection and prevention feature sets, and we utilize appropriately certified cloud resources. When we are processing personally identifiable information covered by HIPAA, we utilize U.S.-based, co-located data centers or HIPAA compliant cloud computing services with advanced data encryption (AES 256 or comparable) applied to data at rest and in motion. Government Regulation We are subject to a number of U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations that relate to our business, including those governing privacy and data protection. We comply with the requirements of the United States Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 as amended (including by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Data 9 Table of Contents (HITECH)) (HIPAA), the United Kingdom’s General Data Protection Regulation as tailored by the Data Protection Act 2018, the EU General Data Protection Regulation, and local laws regulating data privacy, as applicable. Research and Development Our Innodata Labs researches and develops AI-based technologies that we utilize in our operations and with our customers. The Innodata Labs team is comprised of data scientists, including data scientists who have published leading papers on discrete topics in data science and have earned PhD degrees in fields such as data entity extraction. Environmental, Social, and Governance We are values-driven company, committed to continuously improving how we perform as a steward of nature, manage relationships with our employees, suppliers, customers and communities, and conduct our business. While we are driven by the vision of ushering in the promise of digital data and ubiquitous AI, we are cognizant that the disruption AI will inevitably cause will not be equitably distributed. Ironically, many of the communities in which we source human capital for AI projects – communities in India, the Philippines, and Sri Lanka – are also more heavily dependent on manual labor and face greater potential disruption as a result of AI. Therefore, as we set out on our AI journey six years ago, we made a concomitant commitment to do our part to help economically disadvantaged youth (especially young women) in these communities become technology-savvy. It was our aspiration that they become empowered beneficiaries of an AI-enabled world rather than its victims. From 2016 to 2021, our employees have contributed over 1,600 person days to our I-Hope program. I-Hope has built 14 fully-functional computer labs at schools across India, the Philippines, and Sri Lanka, and has donated over 110,000 books and other educational materials to schools and a public library. We believe these efforts stand to benefit approximately 70,000 students, teachers and the members of the general public. As a direct result of our work, we believe approximately 5,700 more children are now technology proficient and ready to take on challenges of navigating an increasingly AI-enabled world. In 2021, we were the proud recipients of the Corporate Excellence Awards in CSR Programs and Health, Safety, and Environment Programs 2020-2021 issued by Cebu IT-BTM Organization (CIB.O), and the DSWD Philippines (Department of Social Welfare & Development) Regional Citation Award. Our goal is to technology-enable 24,000 children by 2025, and we will be devoting a portion of our revenue to this worthy goal. Employees As of December 31, 2021, we employed 225 persons in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, and 4,706 persons in the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka, Canada, Germany, and Israel, and we had 4,878 full-time employees. Many of our employees hold advanced degrees in specialized fields such as law, business, technology, medicine, and social sciences. No employees are currently represented by a labor union, and we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory. Corporate Offices Our principal executive offices are located at 55 Challenger Road, Ridgefield Park, New Jersey 07660, just outside New York City, and our telephone number is (201) 371-8000. We were founded in 1988. Our website is www.innodata.com; information contained on our website is not included as a part of, or incorporated by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K. There we make available, free of charge, our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file that material with, or furnish it to, the SEC. Our SEC reports can be obtained through the Investor Relations section of our website or from the Securities and Exchange Commission at www.sec.gov. Item 1A. Risk Factors. The risk factors set forth below describe what the Company believes to be the material factors, risks, and uncertainties related to our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The risks and uncertainties set forth below, as well as other factors described elsewhere in this Form 10-K or in other filings by the Company with the SEC, could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to the Company or that are not currently believed by the Company to be material may also harm the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. 10 Table of Contents Risks Related to Our Business and Operations We have historically relied on a limited number of clients that have accounted for a significant portion of our revenues, and our results of operations could be adversely affected if we were to lose one or more of these significant clients . We have historically relied on a limited number of clients that have accounted for a significant portion of our revenues. One client in the DDS segment generated approximately 11% and 14% of the Company’s total revenues in the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. No other client accounted for 10% or more of total revenues during these periods. Further, in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, revenues from non-U.S. clients accounted for 45% and 54%, respectively, of the Company’s revenues. We may lose one or more of these clients, or our other major clients, as a result of our failure to meet or satisfy our client’s requirements, the completion or termination of a project or engagement, or the client’s selection of another service provider. In addition, the volume of work performed for our major clients may vary from year to year, and services they require from us may change from year to year. They may also request that we modify certain key terms of our agreements with them as a condition of continuing to do business with us. If the volume of work performed for our major clients varies, if the services they require from us change, or if they require price concessions, our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected, and we may incur a loss from operations. If certain key terms of our agreements with our major clients are modified, our revenues and results of operations may be adversely affected. Our services are typically subject to client requirements, and in many cases are terminable upon 30 to 90 days’ notice. The loss of these clients or a significant variation in the volume of work performed for these clients may have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition and results of operations. A portion of our services is provided on a non-recurring basis for specific projects, and our inability to replace large projects when they are completed or otherwise terminated has adversely affected, and could in the future adversely affect, our revenues and results of operations. We provide a portion of our services for specific projects that generate revenues that terminate on completion of a defined task. While we seek, whenever possible, on completion or termination of large projects, to counterbalance periodic declines in revenues with new arrangements to provide services to the same client or others, our inability to obtain sufficient new projects to counterbalance any decreases in such work may adversely affect our future revenues and results of operations. New acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic investments or partnerships could harm our operating results. We may pursue acquisitions, joint ventures or engage in strategic investments or partnerships to grow and enhance our capabilities. There can be no assurance that we will successfully consummate any acquisitions or joint ventures, or realize profit from strategic investments, or achieve desired financial and operating results. Further, such activities involve a number of risks and challenges, including proper evaluation, diversion of management’s attention and proper integration with our current business. Accordingly, we might fail to realize the expected benefits or strategic objectives of any such venture we undertake. If we are unable to complete the kind of acquisitions for which we plan, we may not be able to achieve our planned rates of growth, profitability or competitive position in specific markets or services. Our new clients may sunset their products because of lack of sufficient revenues or declining revenues, and this may result in termination of our work for these clients. As we obtain new opportunities and win new business, our clients may not generate the level of revenues that we initially anticipated at the time of signing a contract with them, or our clients may experience declining revenues with their existing products. This could be due to various reasons beyond our or their control, and it could lead to termination of projects or contracts. As we normally invest in people and technology and incur other costs in anticipation of revenues, any such deviation from our expected plan or anticipated results could impact our margins and earnings. Our success is dependent on our ability to successfully develop new services, platforms and solutions and enhance our existing services, platforms and solutions, and market acceptance of these offerings and our ability to compete with new vendors with lean cost and flexible cost models. The information technology and artificial intelligence (AI) industries are characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, changing client preferences, new product and service introductions and the emergence of new vendors with lean cost and flexible cost models. Our future success will depend on our ability to successfully develop services, platforms and solutions that keep pace with changes in our addressable markets, and the acceptance of these services, platforms and solutions by our existing and target clients. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in developing new services, platforms and solutions, addressing evolving 11 Table of Contents technologies on a timely or cost-effective basis or, if these services, platforms and solutions are developed, that we will be successful in the marketplace. We also cannot guarantee that we will be able to compete effectively with new vendors offering lean cost and flexible cost models, or that products, services or technologies developed by others will not render our services, platforms and solutions non-competitive or obsolete. Our failure to address these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We operate in highly competitive markets. While we invest in developing and pursuing new services, platforms and solutions, our profitability could be reduced if these services, platforms and solutions do not yield the profit margins we expect, or if the new offerings do not generate the planned revenues. The markets for our services, platforms and solutions are highly competitive. Some of our competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, human, technical and other resources and greater name recognition than we do. There are relatively few barriers preventing companies from entering the markets in which we operate. As a result, new market entrants also pose a threat to our business. We also compete with in-house personnel at current and prospective clients who may attempt to duplicate our offerings using their own personnel. We have made and continue to make significant investments towards building-out new capabilities to pursue growth. These investments increase our costs, and if these new capabilities do not yield the revenues or profit margins we expect, and we are unable to grow our business and revenue proportionately, our profitability may be reduced, or we may incur losses. If we are not able to compete effectively in the markets we serve or if we are not able to successfully develop new services, platforms and solutions, our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected. We depend on third-party technology in the provision of our services. We rely upon certain software that we license from third parties, including software integrated with our internally developed software used in the provision of our services. These third-party software licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable or competitive terms, if at all. The loss of, or inability to maintain or obtain any of these software licenses, could result in delays in the provision of our services until we develop, identify, license and integrate equivalent software. Any delay in the provision of our services could damage our business and adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, our Company utilizes third party data centers to serve our clients and generate revenue. Any disruption in the provision of services from these data centers could result in loss of revenue, client dissatisfaction and loss of clients. Our Agility segment relies on third parties to provide certain content and data for our solutions. The cessation by third parties to provide their content has adversely affected, and could in the future adversely affect, our revenue and results of operations. Our Agility segment relies on third parties to provide or make available certain data for our information databases and our news and social media monitoring service. These third parties, in the past, have restricted access to certain content and may not renew agreements to provide content to us or may increase the price they charge for their content. Additionally, the quality of the content provided to us may not be acceptable to us and we may need to enter into agreements with additional third parties. In the event we are unable to use or have access to such third-party content or are unable to enter into agreements with new third parties, current clients may discontinue their relationship with us, and it may be difficult to acquire new clients. Our businesses are reliant on key employees, and we may face high attrition in our talent. We may not be able to replace displaced talent with new talent on a timely basis or with equivalent skill sets. We are, to a considerable degree, reliant on the continuing leadership of our Chief Executive Officer and would be materially and adversely affected should he unexpectedly cease to be employed by us. In addition, our businesses are subject to fierce competition for talent, which could result in high attrition of our employees, or we may not be able to find the requisite talent to operate our businesses. A significant increase in the attrition rate among employees with specialized skills could decrease our operating efficiency and productivity. Our failure to attract, train and retain personnel with the qualifications necessary to fulfill the needs of our existing and future clients or to assimilate new employees successfully could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, fluctuations in our business may require that we lay off employees with possible negative effects on employee morale. We try to minimize these risks by actively promoting employee relationships and offering competitive salaries, but if we cannot mitigate these risks, our business and our operating performance could be adversely affected. 12 Table of Contents We operate from multiple locations and our employees are very diverse, so we have significant coordination risks. We are headquartered in Ridgefield Park, New Jersey, just outside New York City, and our Agility business is headquartered in Ottawa, Canada. We have delivery centers in the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka, Canada, the United Kingdom, Israel, and Germany. Our employees are geographically dispersed, as well as culturally diverse. Our personnel need to work together to successfully execute our business plans and we invest in various measures to improve coordination and teamwork. Should we fail in these efforts, our ability to execute our business plans may be adversely affected. Our intellectual property rights are valuable and if we are unable to protect them or are subject to intellectual property rights claims, our business may be harmed. Our intellectual property rights include certain trademarks, trade secrets, domain name registrations, a patent and patent applications. Although we take precautions to protect our intellectual property rights, these efforts may not be sufficient or effective. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, we may experience difficulties in achieving and maintaining brand recognition. Disruptions in telecommunications, system failures, data corruption or virus attacks could harm our ability to execute our global resource model, which could result in client dissatisfaction and a reduction of our revenues. We use a distributed global resource model. Our North American workforce provides services from the U.S. and Canada, and the balance of our workforce provides services from the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka, the United Kingdom, Israel and Germany. Our global facilities are linked with a telecommunications network that uses multiple service providers. We may not be able to maintain active voice and data communications between our various facilities and our clients’ sites at all times due to disruptions in these networks, system failures, data corruption or virus attacks. Any significant failure in our ability to communicate, or the availability of our platforms, could result in a disruption in our business, which could hinder our performance, or our ability to complete client projects on time, or provide services to our clients. This, in turn, could lead to client dissatisfaction and an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Even though we have implemented network security measures, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to computer viruses, cyber-attacks, break-ins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering or intentional and unintentional disclosure of sensitive and /or confidential personal information by employees and non-employees. Additionally, the Company may not be able to effectively identify and resolve such issues on a timely basis. The occurrence of any of the events described above could result in interruptions, delays, the loss or corruption of data, cessations in the availability of systems or liability under privacy laws or contracts, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. Our international operations subject us to risks inherent in doing business on an international level, any of which could increase our costs and hinder our growth. The major part of our operations is carried on in the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka, Canada, the United Kingdom, Israel, and Germany, while our headquarters are in the U.S., and our clients are primarily located in North America and Europe. While we do not depend on significant revenues from sources internal to the Asian countries in which we operate, we are nevertheless subject to certain adverse economic factors relating to overseas economies generally, including inflation, external debt, a negative balance of trade and underemployment. In certain of the countries in which we operate, tax authorities have exercised, and may continue to exercise, significant discretionary and arbitrary powers to make tax demands or decline to refund payments that may be due to us as per tax returns. Other risks associated with our international business activities include: 13 Table of Contents One or more of these factors could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Political uncertainty, political unrest, terrorism, and natural calamities in the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka and Israel could adversely affect business conditions in those countries, which in turn could disrupt our business and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. Our operations located in the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka and Israel are in countries that remain vulnerable to disruptions from political uncertainty, political unrest, terrorist acts, and natural calamities. Any damage to our network and/or information systems would damage our ability to provide services, in whole or in part, and/or otherwise damage our operations and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Further, political tensions and escalation of hostilities in any of these countries could adversely affect our operations in these countries and therefore adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. Our global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises. We use a distributed global resource model, which exposes us to risks associated with public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics. A public health crisis in one or more of the geographic areas in which we operate could affect our ability to provide services to our clients and adversely affect our results of operations. The continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (“COVID-19”), which the World Health Organization declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020, continues to spread throughout the world. COVID-19 has created significant global economic downturn, disrupted global trade and supply chains, adversely impacted many industries, and contributed to significant volatility in financial markets. In response to COVID-19, countries and local governments have at times imposed restrictions on the operations of non-essential businesses and services, imposed travel restrictions and implemented societal lockdowns. Additionally, companies are taking precautions, such as requiring employees to work remotely and temporarily closing businesses. All of these factors have had, and are likely to continue to have, a severe adverse effect on global economic conditions, underemployment and unemployment, consumer spending and reductions in non-essential spending by governments and private companies, as well as uncertainty in financial markets. We have experienced limited operational disruptions and declines in customer demand for services to date; however, depending upon the extent duration and evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the introduction of new COVID-19 variants or the spread of existing COVID-19 variants, we may experience a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition as a result of the effects of COVID-19. In response to the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 we triggered our Business Continuity Plan for our global delivery centers and offices, enabling us to continue operations while safeguarding the health and welfare of our employees. While the pandemic presented, and may in the future present, new risks to our business and there have been logistical and other challenges, there was no material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021. The COVID-19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition by, among others, customers with at-will contracts, particularly in our DDS segment, reducing, delaying or cancelling orders; reduced spending by customers on third-party service providers as part of cost-rationalization efforts or otherwise; or customers determining to bring services in-house and/or customers delaying or postponing data engineering needs. Additionally, the effects of COVID-19 could exacerbate any 14 Table of Contents other risks or uncertainties to which we are subject. Lastly, should we experience material adverse effects on our results of operations or financial condition, we may not be able to access additional sources of liquidity at rates that are acceptable to us, if at all. The situation surrounding COVID-19 crisis remains fluid and the extent and duration of its impact to the economy remains unclear. For this reason, we cannot reasonably estimate with any degree of certainty the future impact to our results of operations and financial condition. The potential for a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition increases the longer the virus affects the level of economic activity in the United States and globally. In the event we experience a significant or prolonged reduction in revenues, the likelihood of which is uncertain, we would seek to manage our liquidity by reducing capital expenditures, deferring investment activities, and reducing operating costs as we would likely have no other source of liquidity to support ongoing operations in a manner that is not significantly detrimental to the business. Terrorist attacks or a war could adversely affect our results of operations. Terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war could affect us or our clients by disrupting normal business practices for extended periods of time and reducing business confidence. In addition, acts of violence or war may make travel more difficult and may effectively curtail our ability to serve our clients’ needs, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations. We may face various risks associated with shareholder activists or shareholder demands for better performance . There is no assurance that we will not be subject to shareholder activism or demands. Such activities could interfere with our ability to execute our strategic plan, be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations, and divert the attention of management and our employees. We are the subject of continuing litigation, including litigation by certain of our former employees. In 2008, a judgment was rendered in the Philippines against a Philippine subsidiary of the Company that is no longer active and purportedly also against Innodata Inc., in favor of certain former employees of the Philippine subsidiary. The potential payment amount aggregates to approximately $6.4 million, plus legal interest that accrued at 12% per annum from August 13, 2008 to June 30, 2013, and thereafter accrued and continues to accrue at 6% per annum. The potential payment amount as expressed in U.S. dollars varies with the Philippine peso to U.S. dollar exchange rate. In December 2017, a group of 97 of the former employees of the Philippine subsidiary indicated that they proposed to record the judgment as to themselves in New Jersey. In January 2018, in response to an action initiated by Innodata Inc., the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey (“USDC”) entered a preliminary injunction that enjoins these former employees from pursuing or seeking recognition or enforcement of the judgment against Innodata Inc. in the U.S. during the pendency of the action and until further order of the USDC. In June 2018, the USDC entered a consent order administratively closing the action subject to return of the action to the active docket upon the written request of Innodata Inc. or the former employees, with the USDC retaining jurisdiction over the matter and the preliminary injunction remaining in full force and effect. The principal relevant cases in the Philippines are Court of Appeals Case Nos. CA-G.R. SP No. 93295 Innodata Employees Association (IDEA), Eleanor Tolentino, et al. vs. Innodata Philippines, Inc., et al., and CA-G.R. SP No. 90538 Innodata Philippines, Inc. vs. Honorable Acting Secretary Manuel G. Imson, et al. (28 June 2007), the Department of Labor and Employment National Labor Relations Commission, Republic of the Philippines (NLRC-NCR-Case No.07-04713-2002, et al., Innodata Employees Association (IDEA) and Eleanor A. Tolentino, et al. vs. Innodata Philippines, Inc., et al), and the Department of Labor and Employment Office of the Secretary of Labor and Employment, Republic of the Philippines (Case No. OS-AJ-0015-2001, In Re: Labor Dispute at Innodata Philippines, Inc.). The U.S. District Court action is Civil Action No.: 2:17-cv-13268-SDW-LDW Innodata Inc. v. Myrna C. Augustin-Simon; et al. We are also subject to various other legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. While we believe that we have adequate reserves for those losses that we believe are probable and can be reasonably estimated, the ultimate results of legal proceedings and claims cannot be predicted with certainty. While we currently believe that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or overall trends in our consolidated results of operations, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties. Substantial recovery against us in the above- referenced Philippines action could have a material adverse impact on us, and unfavorable rulings or recoveries in the other proceedings could have a material adverse impact on the consolidated operating results of the period in which the ruling or recovery occurs. In addition, our estimate of potential impact on our consolidated financial position or overall consolidated results of operations for the above referenced legal proceedings could change in the future. See “Legal Proceedings”. 15 Table of Contents Our reputation could be damaged, or our profitability could suffer if we do not meet the controls and procedures in respect of the services and solutions we provide to our clients, or if we contribute to our clients’ internal control deficiencies. Our clients may perform audits or require us to perform audits, provide audit reports or obtain certifications with respect to the controls and procedures that we use in the performance of services for such clients, especially when we process data or information belonging to them. Our ability to acquire new clients and retain existing clients may be adversely affected and our reputation could be harmed if we receive a qualified opinion, or if we cannot obtain an appropriate certification or opinion with respect to our controls and procedures in connection with any such audit in a timely manner. Additionally, our profitability could suffer if our controls and procedures were to fail or to impair our client’s ability to comply with its own internal control requirements. Our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2021, and as a result, it is possible that our disclosure controls and procedures will not prevent or detect all errors and all instances of fraud. The ineffective disclosure controls and procedures could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and have a negative effect on the market prices for our common stock. We are required to maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that material information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that the information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We performed an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as December 31, 2021 and concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2021. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures could restrict our ability to access the capital markets, require significant resources to correct, subject us to fines, penalties or judgments, harm our reputation or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence and cause a decline in the market price of our common stock. Risks Related to Our Contracts A portion of our revenue is generated from projects that we characterize as recurring in nature. Projects that we characterize as recurring are nevertheless subject to termination. Our operating performance is materially dependent on the continuation of these projects. However, we are exposed to the risks that these projects may not be renewed by our clients or they could be terminated by our clients and we may not be able to replace these terminated projects with new recurring projects with similar profitability or clients may ask for a price reduction, which could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations. Our solutions for the Agility segment are sold pursuant to subscription agreements, and if subscription clients elect either not to renew these agreements, or to renew these agreements for less expensive services, our revenues and results of operations will be adversely affected. Our Agility segment derives its revenues primarily from subscription arrangements. Our clients may choose not to renew subscription agreements when they expire or may renew them at lower prices or for a significantly narrower scope of work. If large numbers of existing subscription clients do not renew these agreements or renew these agreements on terms less favorable to us, and if we cannot replace or supplement those non-renewals with new subscription agreements generating the same or greater levels of revenue, our revenues and results of operations will be adversely affected. If our clients are not satisfied with our services, they may terminate our contracts with them or our services and we may suffer reputational damage, which could have an adverse impact on our business. Our business model depends in large part on our ability to attract additional work from our base of existing clients. Our business model also depends on relationships our account teams develop with our clients so that we can understand our clients’ needs and deliver solutions and services that are tailored to those needs. If a client is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us, or with the type of services or solutions delivered, then we could incur additional costs to address the situation, the profitability of that work might be impaired, and the client’s dissatisfaction with our services could damage our ability to obtain additional work from that client. In particular, clients that are not satisfied might seek to terminate existing contracts, which could mean that we could incur costs for the services performed with no associated revenue upon termination of a contract. This could also direct future business to our competitors. 16 Table of Contents In addition, negative publicity related to our client services or relationships, regardless of its accuracy, may further damage our business by affecting our reputation and our ability to compete for new contracts with current and prospective clients. Risks Related to Financial Performance or General Economic Conditions We have no bank facilities or line of credit. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash flows from operations will provide sufficient sources of liquidity to satisfy our financial needs for the next 12 months. However, we have no bank facilities or lines of credit, and reductions in our cash and cash equivalents from operating losses, capital expenditures, adverse legal decisions, acquisitions or other events affecting our access to capital could materially and adversely affect the Company. See “Management Discussion and Analysis – Liquidity and Capital Resources” for additional information. A large portion of our accounts receivable is payable by a limited number of clients; the inability of any of these clients to pay its obligations could adversely affect our results of operations. Several significant clients account for a large percentage of our accounts receivable. If any of these clients were unable, or refused, for any reason, to pay our accounts receivable, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. As of December 31, 2021, 57% or $6.3 million, of our accounts receivable was due from six clients. In addition, we evaluate the financial condition of our clients prior to extending credit to them. We maintain specific allowances against doubtful receivables. Actual losses on client balances could differ from those that we currently anticipate and, as a result, we might need to adjust our allowances. There is no guarantee that we will accurately assess the creditworthiness of our clients. Macroeconomic conditions could also result in financial difficulties, including limited access to the credit markets, insolvency or bankruptcy, for our clients, and, as a result, could cause clients to delay payments to us, request modifications to their payment arrangements that could increase our receivables balance, or default on their payment obligations to us. If we are unable to timely collect from our clients, our cash flows could be adversely affected. Quarterly fluctuations in our revenues and results of operations could make financial forecasting difficult and could negatively affect our stock price. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, significant fluctuations in our quarterly revenues and results of operations. During the past eight quarters, our net income ranged from income of approximately $1.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 to a loss of approximately $1.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. We experience fluctuations in our revenue and results of operations as we replace and begin new projects, which may have some normal start-up delays, or we may be unable to replace a project entirely or on terms that are as attractive to us as the project that is being replaced. These and other factors may contribute to fluctuations in our results of operations from quarter to quarter. A high percentage of our operating expenses, particularly personnel and rent, are relatively fixed in advance of any particular quarter. As a result, unanticipated variations in the number and timing of our projects, or in employee wage levels and utilization rates, may cause us to significantly underutilize our production capacity and employees, resulting in significant variations in our operating results in any particular quarter, and have resulted in losses. The economic environment and pricing pressures could negatively impact our revenues and operating results. Due to the intense competition involved in outsourcing and information technology services, we generally face pricing pressures from our clients due to competition from other companies in our markets. Our ability to maintain or increase pricing is restricted as clients generally expect to receive volume discounts or special pricing incentives as we do more business with them; moreover, our large clients may exercise pressure for discounts outside of agreed terms. 17 Table of Contents Our profitability could suffer if we are not able to maintain pricing on our existing projects and win new projects at appropriate margins. If our pricing structures do not accurately anticipate the cost and complexity of performing our work, then our contracts could be unprofitable. Our profit margin, and therefore our profitability, is dependent on the rates we are able to charge for our services measured against the costs of providing the services. If we are not able to maintain pricing on our existing services and win new projects at profitable margins, or if we underestimate the costs or complexities of new projects and incur losses, our profitability could suffer. The amounts we are able to recover for our services are affected by a number of factors, including competition, volume fluctuations, productivity of employees and processes, the value our client derives from our services and general economic and political conditions. Furthermore, we provide services either on a time-and-materials basis or on a fixed-price basis. Our pricing is highly dependent on our internal forecasts and predictions about our projects, which might be based on limited data and could turn out to be inaccurate. If we do not accurately estimate the costs and timing for completing projects, our contracts could prove unprofitable for us or yield lower profit margins than anticipated. We may not be able to obtain price or volume increases that are necessary to offset the effect of wage inflation and other government mandated cost increases. We have experienced wage inflation and other government mandated cost increases in the Asian countries where we have the majority of our operations. In addition, we may experience adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. These global events have put pressure on our profitability and our margins. Although we have tried to partially offset wage increases, foreign currency fluctuations and other such increases through price increases and improving our efficiency, we cannot ensure that we will be able to continue to do so in the future, which could negatively impact our results of operations. Our international operations subject us to currency exchange fluctuations, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Although most of our revenues are denominated in U.S. dollars, a significant portion of our revenues are denominated in Canadian dollars, Pound Sterling and Euros. In addition, a significant portion of our expenses, primarily labor expenses in the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka, Germany, Canada, the United Kingdom and Israel, are incurred in the local currencies of the countries in which we operate. For financial reporting purposes, we translate all non-U.S. denominated transactions into U.S. dollars in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP). Fluctuations in the value of these currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could have a direct impact on our revenues and our results of operations. The Philippines, India and Sri Lanka have, at times, experienced high rates of inflation, as well as major fluctuations in the exchange rate between such foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar. We are also subject to fluctuations in exchange rates that affect the value of funds held by our foreign subsidiaries. Although we selectively undertake hedging activities to mitigate certain of these risks, our hedging activities may not be effective and may result in losses. See Note 14, “Derivatives,” to the consolidated financial statements. In the event that the governments of India or the Philippines or the government of another country changes its tax policies, rules and regulations, our tax expense may increase and affect our effective tax rates. We are subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. We are subject to the continual examination by tax authorities in India and in the Philippines, and the Company assesses the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits could be materially different from what is reflected in historical income tax and indirect tax provisions and accruals, and could result in a material effect on the Company’s income tax provision, indirect tax expenses, net income or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made. If additional taxes are assessed, it could have an adverse impact on our financial results. In addition, changes in the tax rates, tax laws or the interpretation of tax laws in the jurisdictions where we operate, could affect our future results of operations. In September 2015, the Company’s Indian subsidiary was subject to an inquiry by the Service Tax Department in India regarding the classification of services provided by this subsidiary, asserting that the services provided by this subsidiary fall under the category of online information and database access or retrieval services (“OID Services”), and not under the category of business support services (“BS Services”) that are exempt from service tax as historically indicated in the subsidiary’s service tax filings. Our management 18 Table of Contents disagrees with the Service Tax Department’s position. In November 2019, the Commissioner of Central Tax, GST & Central Excise issued an order confirming the Service Tax Department’s position. The Company is contesting this order in an appeal to the Customs, Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal. In the event the Service Tax Department is ultimately successful in proving that the services fall under the category of OID Services, the revenues earned by the Company’s Indian subsidiary for the period July 2012 through November 2016 would be subject to a service tax of between 12.36% and 15%, and this subsidiary may also be liable to pay interest and penalties. The revenue of our Indian subsidiary during this period was approximately $63.0 million. In accordance with new rules promulgated by the Service Tax Department, as of December 1, 2016 service tax is no longer applicable to OID or BS Services. Based on the Company’s assessment, in consultation with the Company’s tax counsel, the Company has not recorded any tax liability for this case. In a separate action relating to service tax refunds, in October 2016, the Company’s Indian subsidiary received notices from the Indian Service Tax Department in India seeking to reverse service tax refunds of approximately $160,000 previously granted to our Indian subsidiary for three quarters in 2014, asserting that the services provided by this subsidiary fall under the category of OID Services and not BS Services. The appeal was determined in favor of the Service Tax Department. Management disagrees with the basis of this decision and is contesting it. The Company expects delays in its Indian subsidiary receiving further service tax refunds until this matter is adjudicated with finality, and currently has service tax credits of approximately $1.0 million recorded as a receivable. Based on the Company’s assessment, in consultation with the Company’s tax counsel, the Company has not recorded any tax liability for this case. Substantial recovery against us in the above referenced 2015 Service Tax Department case could have a material adverse impact on us, and unfavorable rulings or recoveries in other tax proceedings could have a material impact on the consolidated operating results of the period in which the rulings or recovery occurs. If tax authorities in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate contest the manner in which we allocate our profits, our net loss could be higher. A significant portion of the services we provide to our clients are provided by our Asian subsidiaries located in different jurisdictions. Tax authorities in some of these jurisdictions have from time to time challenged the manner in which we allocate our profits among our subsidiaries, and we may not prevail in any future challenge of this type. If such a challenge were successful, our worldwide effective tax rate could increase, thereby decreasing our profitability. An expiration or termination of our preferential tax rate incentives could adversely affect our results of operations. Two of our foreign subsidiaries are subject to preferential tax rates. This tax incentive provides that we pay reduced income taxes with respect to those jurisdictions for a fixed period of time. An expiration or termination of these incentives could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, or increase our tax expense, thereby decreasing our net income and adversely affecting our results of operations. Our earnings may be adversely affected if we change our intent not to repatriate our foreign earnings and profits or if such earnings and profits become subject to U.S. tax on a current basis. A significant portion of our operations are conducted outside the U.S. Despite our access to the overseas earnings and the resulting toll charge, we intend to indefinitely reinvest the foreign earnings in our foreign subsidiaries on account of the foreign jurisdiction withholding tax that the Company has to incur on the actual remittances. Unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries amounted to approximately $50.0 million at December 31, 2021. If such earnings are repatriated in the future, or are no longer deemed to be indefinitely reinvested, the Company would have to accrue as a liability the applicable amount of foreign jurisdiction withholding taxes associated with such remittances. It is unlikely that we will pay dividends. We have not paid any cash dividends since our inception and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We expect that our earnings, if any, will be used to finance our growth. 19 Table of Contents Risks Related to Laws and Regulations Governmental and client focus on data security could increase our costs of operations. In addition, any incident in which we fail to protect our client’s information against security breaches may result in monetary damages against us, and termination of our engagement by our client, and may adversely impact our results of operations. Certain laws and regulations regarding data privacy and security affecting our clients impose requirements regarding the privacy and security of information maintained by these clients, as well as notification to persons whose personal information is accessed by an unauthorized third party. As a result of any continuing legislative initiatives and client demands, we may have to modify our operations with the goal of further improving data security. The cost of compliance with these laws and regulations is high and is likely to increase in the future. Any such modifications may result in increased expenses and operating complexity, and we may be unable to increase the rates we charge for our services sufficiently to offset these increases. In addition, as part of the services we perform, we have access to confidential client data, including sensitive personal data. As a result, we are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect this information. We may also be bound by certain client agreements to use and disclose the confidential client information in a manner consistent with the privacy standards under regulations applicable to such client. Any failure on our part to comply with these laws and regulations can result in negative publicity and diversion of management’s time and effort and may subject us to significant liabilities and other penalties. If client confidential information is inappropriately disclosed due to a breach of our computer systems, system failures or otherwise, or if any person, including any of our employees, negligently disregards or intentionally breaches controls or procedures with which we are responsible for complying with respect to such data or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data, we may have substantial liabilities to our clients. Any incidents with respect to the handling of such information could subject us to litigation or indemnification claims with our clients and other parties. In addition, any breach or alleged breach of our confidentiality agreements with our clients may result in termination of their engagements, resulting in associated loss of revenue and increased costs. Our business is subject to applicable laws and regulations relating to foreign corrupt practices, the violation of which could adversely affect our operations. We must comply with all applicable anti-bribery laws and regulations of the U.S. and other jurisdictions where we operate. For example, we are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010 relating to corrupt and illegal payments to government officials and others. Although we have policies and controls in place that are designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, it is possible that an employee or an agent acting on our behalf could fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, and due to the complex nature of the risks, it may not always be possible for us to ascertain compliance with such laws and regulations. In such event, we could be exposed to civil penalties, criminal penalties and other sanctions, including fines or other unintended punitive actions, and we could incur substantial legal fees and related expenses. In addition, such violations could damage our business and/or our reputation. All of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. Anti-outsourcing legislation, if adopted, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and impair our ability to service our clients. The issue of outsourcing of services abroad by U.S. companies is a topic of political discussion in the U.S. While no substantive anti-outsourcing legislation has been introduced to date, given the ongoing debate over this issue, the introduction of such legislation is possible. If introduced, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected and our ability to service our clients could be impaired. Our growth could be hindered by visa restrictions. Occasionally, we have employees from our other facilities visit or transfer to the U.S. to meet our clients or work on projects at a client’s site. Any visa restrictions or new legislation putting a restriction on issuing visas could affect our business. Immigration and visa laws and regulations in the U.S. and other countries are subject to legislative and administrative changes, as well as changes in the application of standards. Immigration and visa laws and regulations can be significantly affected by political forces and levels of economic activity. Our international expansion strategy and our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected if legislative or administrative changes to immigration or visa laws and regulations impair our ability to staff projects with our professionals who are not citizens of the country where the work is to be performed. 20 Table of Contents New and changing corporate governance and public disclosure requirements add uncertainty to our compliance policies and increase our costs of compliance. Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to accounting, corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, other SEC regulations, and the Nasdaq Stock Market rules, create uncertainty for companies like ours. These laws, regulations and standards may lack specificity and are subject to varying interpretations. Their application in practice may evolve over time, as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs of compliance as a result of revisions to such corporate governance standards. Although we are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure, and complying with evolving laws, regulations and standards, if we fail to comply with new or changed laws, regulations or standards of corporate governance, our business and reputation may be harmed. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. None. Item 2. Properties. Our services are primarily performed from our Ridgefield Park, New Jersey headquarters and overseas delivery centers in the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka, Canada, the United Kingdom, Israel and Germany all of which are leased. The square footage of all our leased properties totals approximately 163,500. Our leased properties in the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Germany and Israel are primarily used by our DDS segment; our leased property in India is primarily used by our DDS and Synodex segments; and our leased property in Canada and the United Kingdom is primarily used by our Agility segment. Our leased property in the United States is our corporate headquarters and is used by all segments. In addition, we may need to lease additional property in the future. We believe that we will be able to obtain suitable additional facilities on commercially reasonable terms on an “as needed” basis. Item 3. Legal Proceedings.

The following table sets forth certain financial data for the two years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (Dollars in millions) ​ ​ Years Ended December 31, ​ 2021 % of revenue 2020 % of revenue Revenues ​ $ 69.7 100.0 % $ 58.2 100.0 % Direct operating costs ​ 43.5 62.4 % 38.4 66.0 % Selling and administrative expenses ​ 27.9 40.0 % 18.7 32.0 % Income (loss) from operations ​ (1.7) (2.4) % 1.1 2.0 % Interest income (expense) ​ 0.1 ​ (0.1) ​ Gain on loan forgiveness ​ 0.6 ​ - ​ Income (loss) before provision for income taxes ​ (1.0) ​ 1.0 ​ Provision for income taxes ​ 0.8 ​ 0.4 ​ Net income (loss) ​ $ (1.8) ​ $ 0.6 ​ ​ For a summary of our Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies, please refer to Note 1 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements, which are included elsewhere in this Report. Results of Operations Amounts in the MD&A below have been rounded. All percentages have been calculated using rounded amounts. Year Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2020 Revenues Total revenues were $69.7 million and $58.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, an increase of $11.5 million or approximately 20%. Revenues from the DDS segment were $52.6 million and $42.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, an increase of $10.6 million or approximately 25%. The increase was due to higher volume from one client, partially offset by lower volume from two clients. Revenues from the Synodex segment were $4.2 million and $4.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, a decrease of $0.6 million or approximately 13%. The decrease was primarily due to lower volume from three clients. Revenues from the Agility segment were $13.0 million and $11.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 respectively, an increase of $1.6 million or approximately 14%. The increase was attributable to higher revenues from subscriptions to our Agility media database. One client in the DDS segment generated approximately 11% and 14% of the Company’s total revenues in the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. No other client accounted for 10% or more of total revenues during these periods. Further, in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, revenues from non-U.S. clients accounted for 45% and 54% of the Company’s revenues respectively. 23 Table of Contents Direct Operating Costs Direct operating costs consist of direct and indirect labor costs, occupancy costs, data center hosting fees, content acquisition costs, depreciation and amortization, travel, telecommunications, computer services, and supplies, realized gain (loss) on forward contracts, foreign currency remeasurement gain (loss), and other direct expenses that are incurred in providing services to our clients. Direct operating costs were $43.5 million and $38.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, an increase of $5.1 million or approximately 13%. These cost increases primarily supported our current and growth initiatives. Direct operating costs increases include labor related costs of $5.6 million, higher amortization of capitalized developed software and depreciation of $0.8 million, and a reversal of a one-time charge of $0.4 million in the prior year for an assessment of retroactive foreign social security contributions that was successfully adjudicated. These cost increases were offset in part by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations of $0.6 million, and continuing cost optimizations resulting in a reduction of occupancy and technology related costs of $1.1 million. Direct operating costs as percentage of total revenues were approximately 62% and 66% for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease in direct operating costs as a percentage of revenues during the year was primarily due to increased revenue, offset in part by an increase in direct operating costs. Direct operating costs for the DDS segment were $31.8 million and $28.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, an increase of $3.3 million or approximately 12%. These cost increases primarily supported our current and growth initiatives. Direct operating costs increases include labor related costs of $4.1 million, a reversal of a one-time charge of $0.4 million in the prior year for an assessment of retroactive foreign social security contributions that was successfully adjudicated, and other increases of $0.3 million. These cost increases were offset in part by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations of $0.6 million, and continuous cost optimization resulting in a reduction of occupancy and technology related costs of $0.9 million. Direct operating costs for the DDS segment as a percentage of DDS segment revenues were approximately 60% and 68% for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease in direct operating costs of the DDS segment as a percentage of DDS segment revenues during the year was primarily due to increased revenue, offset in part by an increase in direct operating costs. Direct operating costs for the Synodex segment were approximately $4.4 million and $3.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, an increase of $1.0 million or approximately 29%. The increase was primarily due to labor-related costs supporting current and future growth initiatives. Direct operating costs for the Synodex segment as a percentage of segment revenues were approximately 105% and 71% for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in direct operating costs of the Synodex as a percentage of Synodex segment revenues during the year was primarily due to decreased revenues and increased direct operating costs. Direct operating costs for the Agility segment were approximately $7.3 million and $6.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, an increase of $0.8 million or approximately12%. This increase was primarily due to higher depreciation and amortization of capitalized developed software of $0.7 million and an increase in labor related costs of $0.1million. Direct operating costs for the Agility segment as a percentage of Agility segment revenues were approximately 56% and 57% for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease in direct operating costs of the Agility as a percentage of Agility segment revenues during the year was primarily due to higher revenue from subscriptions to our Agility intelligent data platform and newswire products, offset in part by an increase in direct operating costs. Selling and Administrative Expenses Selling and administrative expenses consist of management and administrative payroll and related costs including, commissions, bonuses and stock-based compensation, marketing costs, new services research and related software development, third-party software, advertising and trade conferences, professional fees and consultant costs, and other administrative overhead costs. Selling and administrative expenses were approximately $27.9 million and $18.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, an increase of $9.2 million or approximately 49%. These cost increases supported our business growth strategies for sales expansion and product expansion. Selling and administrative cost increases include payroll-related costs for new hires, including commissions, incentives and stock-based compensation to promote retention, and recruiting fees, of $7.5 million; marketing programs and activities to improve our visibility in the market of $1.6 million, and other increases of $0.1 million. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues were approximately 40% and 32% for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues during the year was primarily due to increased selling and administrative costs, offset in part by an increase in revenues. Selling and administrative expenses for the DDS segment were approximately $15.5 million and $12.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 respectively, an increase of $3.1 million or approximately 25%. These cost increases supported our 24 Table of Contents business growth strategies for sales expansion and product expansion. Selling and administrative cost increases include payroll-related costs for new hires, including commission, incentives and stock-based compensation to promote retention, and recruiting fees, of $2.6 million; marketing programs and activities to improve our visibility in the market of $0.6 million, offset in part by other decreases of $0.1 million. Selling and administrative expenses for the DDS segment as a percentage of DDS segment revenue were approximately 29% and 30% for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues was due to increased selling and administrative expenses, offset by an increase in revenues. Selling and administrative expenses for the Synodex segment were $1.3 million and $0.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021 respectively, an increase of $0.4 million or approximately 44%. This increase was primarily due to payroll related costs of new hires. Selling and administrative expenses for the Synodex segment as a percentage of Synodex segment revenues were approximately 31% and 19% for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues was due to increased selling and administrative expenses and a decrease in revenues. Selling and administrative expenses for the Agility segment were $11.1 million and $5.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, an increase of $5.7 million or approximately 106%. These cost increases supported our business growth strategies for sales expansion and product expansion. Selling and administrative cost increases include payroll-related costs for new hires, including commission, incentives and stock-based compensation to promote retention, and recruiting fees, of $4.5 million; marketing programs and activities to improve our visibility in the market of $1.0 million, and other increases of $0.2 million. Selling and administrative expenses for the Agility segment as a percentage of Agility segment revenues were approximately 85% and 47% for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues was due to increased selling and administrative expenses, offset in part by increased revenues. Goodwill Impairment On September 30, 2021, we performed our annual goodwill assessment for the Agility segment in accordance with the provisions of the FASB’s Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2017-04, “Intangibles – Goodwill and Other (Topic 350)”, by using a single-step approach that evaluates the carrying value of the reporting unit and compares it against the reporting unit’s fair value. The Company determined that there was no impairment of long-lived intangible assets as of September 30, 2021. Gain on PPP Loan Forgiveness On May 4, 2020, we received loan proceeds of $579,700 under the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) which was established as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act of 2020, as amended (“CARES Act”). On May 21, 2021, the Small Business Administration approved our loan forgiveness application for 100% of the loan proceeds. Income Taxes We recorded a provision for income taxes of approximately $0.8 million and $0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Tax-related charges primarily consisted of a provision for foreign taxes recorded in accordance with the local tax regulations by our foreign subsidiaries. Effective income tax rates are disproportionate primarily due to the valuation allowance recorded on the deferred taxes on the U.S. and Canadian entities. See Note 4, “Income Taxes” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 25 Table of Contents The reconciliation of the U.S. statutory rate with the Company’s effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 are summarized in the table below: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 2021 2020 Federal income tax expense (benefit) at statutory rate (21.0) % 21.0 % Effect of: ​ Change in valuation allowance 186.1 137.7 ​ Effect of Section 162 (m) 29.9 - ​ Change in rates 12.2 (172.7) ​ Foreign operations permanent differences - foreign exchange gains and losses 9.5 (1.3) ​ State income tax net of federal benefit 1.9 (4.3) ​ Withholding tax - 1.5 ​ Deemed interest (1.4) (2.1) ​ Return to provision true up (2.3) (10.8) ​ Tax effects of foreign operations 2.0 57.7 ​ Increase in unrecognized tax benefits (ASC 740) (22.8) 31.5 ​ Foreign rate differential (31.8) (8.6) ​ Effect of stock-based compensation (72.1) (10.9) ​ Other (2.8) (0.3) ​ Effective tax rate 87.4 % 38.4 % ​ Despite access to overseas earnings and the resulting toll charge, we intend to indefinitely reinvest earnings and profits in our foreign subsidiaries on account of the foreign jurisdiction withholding taxes that we would have to incur on the actual remittances. Unremitted foreign earnings and profits amounted to approximately $50.0 million at December 31, 2021. If such foreign earnings and profits are repatriated in the future, or are no longer deemed to be indefinitely reinvested, we would have to accrue the applicable amount of foreign jurisdiction withholding taxes associated with such remittances. We have a valuation allowance on all of our U.S. deferred tax assets on account of continuing losses incurred by our U.S. entity. In addition, we also have a valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets of our Canadian subsidiaries. Our Canadian subsidiaries also have research and development credits available to reduce taxable income in future years, which may be carried forward indefinitely. The potential benefits from these balances have not been recognized for financial statement purposes. Tax Assessments In September 2015, our Indian subsidiary was subject to an inquiry by the Service Tax Department in India regarding the classification of services provided by this subsidiary, asserting that the services provided by this subsidiary fall under the category of online information and database access or retrieval services (OID Services), and not under the category of business support services (BS Services) that are exempt from service tax as historically indicated in the subsidiary’s service tax filings. We disagree with the Service Tax Department’s position. In November 2019, the Commissioner of Central Tax, GST & Central Excise issued an order confirming the Service Tax Department’s position. We are vigorously contesting this order in an appeal to the Customs, Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal. In the event the Service Tax Department is ultimately successful in proving that the services fall under the category of OID Services, the revenues earned by our Indian subsidiary for the period July 2012 through November 2016 would be subject to a service tax of between 12.36% and 15%, and this subsidiary may also be liable to pay interest and penalties. The revenue of our Indian subsidiary during this period was approximately $63.0 million. In accordance with new rules promulgated by the Service Tax Department, as of December 1, 2016 service tax is no longer applicable to OID or BS Services. Based on our assessment, in consultation with our tax counsel, we have not recorded any tax liability for this case. In a separate action relating to service tax refunds, in October 2016, our Indian subsidiary received notices from the Indian Service Tax Department in India seeking to reverse service tax refunds of approximately $160,000 previously granted to our Indian subsidiary for three quarters in 2014, asserting that the services provided by this subsidiary fall under the category of OID Services and not BS Services. The appeal was determined in favor of the Service Tax Department. We disagree with the basis of this decision and are contesting it vigorously. We expect delays in our Indian subsidiary receiving further service tax refunds until this matter is adjudicated with finality, and currently have service tax credits of approximately $1.0 million recorded as a receivable. Based on our assessment, in consultation with our tax counsel, we have not recorded any tax liability for this case. 26 Table of Contents Net Income (Loss) We had a net loss of $1.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to a net income of $0.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. The $2.4 million change was due to higher operating expenses of $14.3 million and an increase in tax provision of $0.4 million, partially offset by higher revenues of $11.6 million, gain on loan forgiveness of $0.6 million and net interest income of $0.1 million. Net income for the DDS segment was $5.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to a net income of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The $4.7 million improvement was due to higher revenues of $10.6 million, a gain on loan forgiveness of $0.6 million and net interest income of $0.1 million, partially offset by higher operating expenses of $6.4 million and tax provision of $0.2 million. Net loss for the Synodex segment was $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to net income of $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The $2.0 million change was primarily due to higher operating expenses of $1.4 million and lower revenue of $0.6 million. Net loss for the Agility segment was $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to a net loss of $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The $5.1 million increase in loss was primarily due to higher operating costs of $6.5 million and an increase in tax provision of $0.2 million, partially offset by an increase in revenues of $1.6 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources Selected measures of liquidity and capital resources, expressed in thousands, are as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ December 31, ​ 2021 2020 Cash and cash equivalents ​ $ 18,902 ​ $ 17,573 Working capital ​ 12,658 ​ 13,515 ​ On December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $18.9 million, of which $12.6 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries, and $6.3 million was held in the U.S. Despite the passage of the new tax law under which we may repatriate funds from overseas after paying the toll charge, it is our intent, as of December 31, 2021, to indefinitely reinvest the overseas funds in our foreign subsidiaries due to the withholding tax that we would have to incur on the actual remittances. We have used, and plan to use, our cash and cash equivalents for (i) capital investments; (ii) the expansion of our other operations; (iii) technology innovation; (iv) product management and strategic marketing; (v) general corporate purposes, including working capital; and (vi) possible business acquisitions. As of December 31, 2021, we had working capital of approximately $12.7 million, as compared to working capital of approximately $13.5 million as of December 31, 2020. The decrease in working capital is due to higher liabilities associated with payroll-related accruals. Gain on PPP Loan Forgiveness On May 4, 2020, we received loan proceeds of $579,700 under the PPP which was established as part of the CARES Act. On May 21, 2021, the Small Business Administration approved our loan forgiveness application for 100% of the loan proceeds. Proceeds from stock option exercises for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $2.2 million. We did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures as of December 31, 2021. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash flows from operations will provide sufficient sources of liquidity to satisfy our financial needs for at least 12 months from the date of issuance of these financial statements. However, as we have no bank facilities or lines of credit, reductions in our cash and cash equivalents from operating losses, capital expenditures, adverse legal decisions, acquisitions or otherwise could materially and adversely affect the Company. Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Cash provided by our operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $5.1 million and was the result of the net loss of $1.8 million, the effect of adjustments for non-cash items of $4.6 million and sources of working capital of $2.3 million. 27 Table of Contents Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of $2.9 million for depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation of $1.8 million, pension cost of $ 0.5 million, offset in part by a gain on loan forgiveness of $0.6 million. Working capital activities primarily consisted of sources from a $4.4 million increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other, a $0.7 million increase in accrued salaries, wages and related benefits, a $0.5 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets and a $0.3 million increase in other assets, offset by a $1.9 million increase in accounts receivable and $1.7 million decrease in income and other taxes. Refer to the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for further details. Cash provided by our operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $5.7 million and was the result of the net income of $0.6 million, the effect of adjustments for non-cash items of $3.4 million and sources of working capital of $1.6 million. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of $2.3 million for depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation of $0.9 million and $0.2 million for other non-cash items. Working capital activities primarily consisted of sources from a $1.4 million increase in accrued salaries, wages and related benefits, a $0.8 million increase in income and other taxes, offset by a $0.6 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets. Refer to the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for further details. Our days’ sales outstanding were 56 days and 62 days December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We calculate DSO by first dividing the total revenues for the period by average net accounts receivable, which is the sum of net accounts receivable at the beginning of the period and net accounts receivable at the end of the period, to yield an amount we refer to as the “accounts receivable turnover”. Then we divide the total number of days within the period reported by the accounts receivable turnover to yield DSO expressed in number of days. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities Cash used in our investing activities was $4.4 million and $1.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These capital expenditures were principally for the purchase of technology equipment including servers, network infrastructure and workstations, and expenditures for capitalized developed software. Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2021 amounting to $4.4 million consisted of $2.1 million for the Agility segment, $1.7 million for the DDS segment and $0.6 million for the Synodex segment. For calendar year 2022, we anticipate that capital expenditures for ongoing technology, equipment, new platform development, and infrastructure upgrades will approximate to $11.0 million, a portion of which we may finance. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was proceeds from stock option exercises of $2.2 million. Cash paid for withholding taxes on net settlement exercises of stock options for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $0.8 million. Payments of long-term obligations were $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was proceeds from stock option exercises of $2.6 million and PPP loan proceeds of $0.6 million. Payments of long-term obligations were $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Inflation, Seasonality and Prevailing Economic Conditions Although most of our revenues are denominated in U.S. dollars, a significant portion of our revenues is denominated in Canadian dollars, Pound Sterling and Euros. In addition, a significant portion of our expenses, primarily labor expenses in the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka, Germany, Canada and Israel, are incurred in the local currencies of the countries in which we operate. For financial reporting purposes, we translate all non-U.S. denominated transactions into U.S. dollars in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Thus, we are exposed to the risk that fluctuations in the value of these currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could have a direct impact on our revenues and our results of operations. The Philippines and India have at times experienced high rates of inflation as well as major fluctuations in the exchange rate between the Philippine peso and the U.S. dollar and the Indian rupee and the U.S. dollar. As of December 31, 2021, the aggregate notional amount of our hedges against the Indian rupee was approximately $9.7 million, and against the Philippine peso was approximately $10.0 million. Fluctuations in exchange rates also affect the value of funds held by our foreign subsidiaries. We do not currently intend to hedge these assets. 28 Table of Contents Our most significant costs are the salaries and related benefits of our employees in Asia. We are exposed to high inflation in wage rates in the countries in which we operate. We generally perform work for our clients under project-specific contracts, requirements-based contracts or long-term contracts. We must adequately anticipate wage increases, particularly on our fixed-price contracts. There can be no assurance that we will be able to recover cost increases through increases in the prices that we charge for our services to our clients. Our quarterly operating results are subject to certain fluctuations. We experience fluctuations in our revenue and earnings as we replace and begin new projects, which may have some normal start-up delays, or we may be unable to replace a project entirely. These and other factors may contribute to fluctuations in our operating results from quarter to quarter. In addition, as some of our Asian facilities are closed during holidays in the fourth quarter, we typically incur higher wages, due to overtime, that reduce our margins. Our Synodex subsidiary experiences seasonal fluctuations in revenues. Typically, revenue is lowest in the third quarter of the calendar year and highest in the fourth quarter of the calendar year. The seasonality is directly linked to the number of life insurance applications received by the insurance companies. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Not applicable to smaller reporting companies. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. See Financial Statement Index and Financial Statements commencing on page F-1, which are incorporated by reference herein. Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure. None. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based upon the most recent evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2021, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. We are in the process of implementing measures designed to improve our disclosure controls and procedures, including hiring a third-party consultant, more thoroughly documenting our policies and procedures, and conducting a more efficient review process. We expect to complete these remediation efforts in the second quarter of 2022. Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and disposition of assets; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of company assets are made in accordance with management and director authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected. Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) - issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 29 Table of Contents (COSO). Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2021. This Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management’s report was not subject to attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only management’s report in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the three months ended December 31, 2021 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Innodata Inc. (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income/(loss), stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 1. Measurement of the provision for income tax exposures Description of Matter The Company operates in various countries and is subject to income taxes in multiple tax jurisdictions, with complexities of transfer pricing and changing tax laws, and is involved in various tax cases with respective tax authorities. Uncertainties arise primarily from certain ongoing tax litigations and open tax years for its foreign subsidiaries. As described in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, at December 31, 2021, the Company has recorded unrecognized tax benefits of $1.8 million for uncertain tax positions. We identified measurement of accruals for the aforementioned income tax exposures as a critical audit matter, as the amounts involved are material, and the determination of provision for taxes requires the Company to make judgments on tax issues and develop estimates regarding the Company’s exposure to tax risks. Further, auditing management judgments on whether the tax positions are probable of being sustained in tax assessments involves a high degree of subjectivity.

AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Estimates and Policies Description of Business - Innodata Inc. (including its subsidiaries, the “Company”, “Innodata”, “we”, “us” or “our”) is a global data engineering company. The Company’s mission is to deliver the promise of AI to the world’s most prestigious companies. The Company provides AI-enabled software platforms and managed services to companies that require high-quality data for training AI and machine learning (ML) algorithms. The Company also provides AI digital transformation solutions and platforms to help companies apply AI/ML to real-world problems relating to analyzing and deriving insights from documents. For industry-specific, document-intensive industry business processes, the Company provides AI-augmented software-as-a-service (SaaS) platforms and discrete managed services. The Company’s platforms and services are powered by Goldengate, its proprietary AI/ML platform, as well as other technologies it has developed. In addition, the Company brings to bear more than 4,500 employees spanning eight countries with expertise in data pertaining to many professional fields. The Company’s hybrid approach of using AI/ML in conjunction with human experts enables the Company to deliver superior data quality with even the most complex and sensitive data. The Company developed its capabilities and honed its customer- and quality-centric culture progressively over the last 30 years creating high-quality data for many of the world’s most demanding information companies. Approximately six years ago, the Company formed Innodata Labs, a research and development center, to research, develop and apply machine learning and emerging AI to its large-scale, human-intensive data operations. In 2019, the Company began packaging the capabilities that emerged from its R&D efforts in order to align with several fast-growing new markets and help companies use AI/ML to drive performance benefits and business insights. The Company anticipates this strategy will enable it to accelerate growth. AI Data Annotation The Company trains AI algorithms for social media companies, robotics companies, financial services companies, and many others, working with images, text, video and audio. Data sciences teams seek partners that can perform data preparation functions for them at large-scale and at high quality, while using automated tools to minimize cost. Moreover, as AI projects become more specialized and mission-critical, data preparation is becoming increasingly complex, requiring deep domain knowledge and an infrastructure in which data security is assured. The Company utilizes a variety of leading third-party image and video annotation tools. For text, the Company uses its proprietary data annotation platform that incorporates AI to reduce cost while improving consistency and quality of output. The Company’s proprietary text annotation platform features auto-tagging capabilities that apply to both classical and generative AI tasks. It also encapsulates many of the innovations the Company has conceived of in the course of its 30-year history of creating high-quality data. AI Digital Transformation The Company also provides AI solutions and platforms to companies that intensively process textual data and seek to obtain the benefits of AI/ML technologies without having to develop AI/ML engineering capabilities in-house. For such companies, the Company often integrates one or more of its pre-trained text processing algorithms as a foundation for an overall solution. The Company’s algorithms are accessible as microservices via application programming interfaces (APIs), enabling easy integration. In conjunction with AI digital transformation, the Company often provides a range of data engineering support services, including data transformation, data curation, data hygiene, data consolidation, data compliance, and master data management. The Company’s customers span a diverse range of industries and a wide range of AI use cases, benefiting from the short time-to-value and high economic returns of the Company’s AI digital transformation solutions and platforms. Industry AI Platforms The Company’s industry platforms address specific, niche market requirements that the Company believes it can fulfill in large part with its AI/ML technologies. The Company deploys these industry platforms as software-as-a-service (SaaS) and as managed services. To date, the Company has built an industry platform for medical records data extraction and transformation (which the Company brands as “Synodex ® ”) and an industry platform for public relations (which the Company brands as “Agility PR Solutions”). F-8 Table of Contents INNODATA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Company’s Synodex industry platform transforms medical records into useable digital data organized in accordance with its proprietary data models or customer data models. The Company’s Agility industry platform provides marketing communications and public relations professionals with the ability to target and distribute content to journalists and social media influencers world-wide and to monitor and analyze global news (print, web, radio and TV) and social media. Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies Principles of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Innodata Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, and the Synodex and docGenix limited liability companies that are majority-owned by the Company. The non-controlling interests in the Synodex and docGenix limited liability companies have call and put options that can be settled in cash or stock accordingly is presented in temporary equity in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) non-controlling interest guidance. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Use of Estimates - In preparing consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management believes that the estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are reasonable, and management has made assumptions about the possible effects of the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic on critical and significant accounting estimates. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include those related to the allowance for doubtful accounts and billing adjustments, useful life of long-lived assets, useful life of intangible assets, impairment of goodwill, valuation of deferred tax assets, valuation of stock-based compensation, pension benefit plan assumptions, litigation accruals and estimated accruals for various tax exposures. Revenue Recognition – The Company’s revenue is recognized when services are rendered or goods are delivered to a customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for those services or goods as per the agreement with the customer. In cases where there are agreements with multiple performance obligations, the Company identifies each performance obligation and evaluates whether the performance obligations are distinct within the context of the agreement at the agreement’s inception. Performance obligations that are not distinct at agreement inception are combined. For agreements with distinct performance obligation, the Company allocates the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation proportionately based on the estimated standalone selling price for each performance obligation, if any, and then evaluates how the services are performed for the customer to determine the timing of revenue recognition. For the Digital Data Solutions (DDS) segment, revenue is recognized primarily based on the quantity delivered or resources utilized in the period in which services are performed and performance conditions are satisfied as per the agreement. Revenues for agreements billed on a time-and-materials basis are recognized as services are performed. Revenues under fixed-fee agreements, which are not significant to overall revenues, are recognized based on the proportional performance method of accounting, as services are performed, or milestones are achieved. For the Synodex segment, revenue is recognized primarily based on the quantity delivered in the period in which services are performed and performance conditions are satisfied as per the agreement. A portion of the Synodex segment revenue is derived from licensing our functional software and providing access to the Company’s hosted software platform. Revenue from such services is recognized monthly when all parties to the agreement have agreed to the agreement; each party’s rights are identifiable; the payment terms are identifiable; the agreement has commercial substance; access to the service is provided to the end user; and collection is probable. F-9 Table of Contents INNODATA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Agility segment derives its revenue primarily from subscription arrangements and provision of enriched media analysis services. It also derives revenue as a reseller of corporate communication solutions. Revenue from subscriptions is recognized monthly when access to the service is provided to the end user; all parties to the agreement have agreed to the agreement; each party’s rights are identifiable; the payment terms are identifiable; the agreement has commercial substance; and collection is probable. Revenue from enriched media analysis services is recognized when the services are performed, and performance conditions are satisfied. Revenues from the reseller agreements are recognized at the gross amount received for the goods in accordance with our functioning as a principal due to our meeting the following criteria: the Company acts as the primary obligor in the sales transaction; assumes the credit risk; sets the price; can select suppliers; and is involved in the execution of the services, including after sales service. Revenues include reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses, with the corresponding out-of-pocket expenses included in direct operating costs. The Company considers U.S. GAAP criteria for determining whether to report gross revenue as a principal versus net revenue as an agent. The Company evaluates whether it is in control of the services before the same are transferred to the customer to assess whether it is principal or agent in the arrangement. Revenues are recognized on a gross basis if the Company is in the capacity of principal and on a net basis if it falls in the capacity of an agent. Contract acquisition costs, which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets are amortized over the term of a subscription agreement or contract that normally has a duration of 12 months or less. The Company reviews these prepaid acquisition costs on a periodic basis to determine the need to adjust the carrying values for early terminated contracts. Foreign Currency Translation - The functional currency of the Company’s locations in the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka, Israel and Hong Kong is the U.S. dollar. Transactions denominated in Philippine pesos, Indian and Sri Lankan rupees, Israeli shekels and Hong Kong dollars are translated to U.S. dollars at rates which approximate those in effect on the transaction dates. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at December 31, 2021 and 2020 are translated at the exchange rate in effect as of those dates. Nonmonetary assets, liabilities, and stockholders’ equity are translated at the appropriate historical rates. Included in direct operating costs were exchange (gains) losses resulting from such transactions of approximately $( 533,000 ) and $ 108,000 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The functional currency for the Company’s subsidiaries in Germany, the United Kingdom and Canada are the Euro, the Pound Sterling and the Canadian dollar, respectively. The financial statements of these subsidiaries are prepared in these respective currencies. Financial information is translated from the applicable functional currency to the U.S. dollar (the reporting currency) for inclusion in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Income, expenses and cash flows are translated at weighted average exchange rates prevailing during the fiscal period, and assets and liabilities are translated at fiscal period-end exchange rates. Resulting translation adjustments are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders’ equity. Foreign exchange transaction gains or losses are included in direct operating costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Derivative Instruments - The Company accounts for derivative transactions in accordance with the FASB’s Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 825, “Financial Instruments”. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the entire change in fair value of the hedging instrument is recorded in Other comprehensive income (loss). When the amounts recorded in Other comprehensive income (loss) are reclassified to earnings, they are included as part of Direct operating costs. For derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, any change in fair value is recorded directly in earnings as part of Direct operating costs. The total notional value of designated outstanding foreign currency forward contracts at December 31, 2021 was $ 19.7 million. There were no non-designated hedges as of December 31, 2021. The total notional value of non-designated outstanding foreign currency forward contracts at December 31, 2020 was $ 6.9 million. There were no designated hedges as of December 31, 2020. Cash Equivalents - For financial statement purposes, the Company considers all highly-liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Property and Equipment - Property and equipment are stated at cost and are depreciated on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which is generally two to ten years . Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the terms of the leases. Certain assets under capital leases are amortized over the lives of the respective leases or the estimated useful lives of the assets, whichever is shorter. F-10 Table of Contents INNODATA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Capitalized Developed Software - the Company incurs development costs related to its internal use software. Qualifying costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized. These costs primarily consist of internal labor and third-party development costs and are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, which is generally ranges between three and ten years . All other research and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Capitalized developed software in progress as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $ 0.6 million and $ 1.4 million respectively. The cumulative completed capitalized developed software as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $ 8.6 million and $ 5.5 million respectively. Long-lived Assets - Management assesses the recoverability of its long-lived assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The following factors, if present, may trigger an impairment review: (i) significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results; (ii) significant negative industry or economic trends; (iii) significant decline in the Company’s stock price for a sustained period; and (iv) a change in the Company’s market capitalization relative to net book value. If the recoverability of these assets is unlikely because of the existence of one or more of the above-mentioned factors, an impairment analysis is performed, using undiscounted cash flow projections. Management makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of these respective assets. An impairment loss will be recognized only if the carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value, and is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair value. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets – The Company performs a valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed on each acquisition accounted for as a business combination and allocates the purchase price of each acquired business to its respective net tangible and intangible assets and liabilities. Acquired intangible assets principally consist of technology, client relationships, backlog and trademarks. Liabilities related to intangibles principally consist of unfavorable vendor contracts. The Company determines the appropriate useful life by performing an analysis of expected cash flows based on projected financial information of the acquired businesses. Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method, which approximates the pattern in which the majority of the economic benefits are expected to be consumed. Intangible assets are amortized into direct operating costs ratably over their expected related revenue streams over their useful lives. Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the fair value of the acquired net assets. The Company does not amortize goodwill but evaluates it for impairment at the reporting unit level annually during the third quarter of each fiscal year (as of September 30 of that year) or when an event occurs, or circumstances change, that indicates the carrying value may not be recoverable. The Company performed its annual goodwill assessment for the Agility segment as of September 30, 2021. In performing the assessment, the Company adhered to the provisions of ASU 2017-04 by using a single step approach that determines the carrying value of goodwill and comparing it against the excess of the reporting unit’s fair value. Based on the Company’s assessment, the Company reached the conclusion that there was no goodwill impairment because the fair value of the Agility segment’s goodwill exceeded its carrying value. Income Taxes – Estimated deferred taxes are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates, as well as any net operating loss or tax credit carryforwards expected to reduce taxes payable in future years. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the estimated deferred tax assets will not be realized. While the Company considers future taxable income in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event that the Company anticipates that it will be able to realize the estimated deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount, an adjustment to the provision for deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made. Similarly, in the event that the Company anticipates that it will not be able to realize the estimated deferred tax assets in the future considering future taxable income, an adjustment to the provision for deferred tax assets would decrease income in the period such determination was made. Changes in the valuation allowance from period to period are included in the Company’s tax provision in the period of change. The Company indefinitely reinvests the foreign earnings in its foreign subsidiaries. If such earnings are repatriated in the future, or are no longer deemed to be indefinitely reinvested, the Company would have to accrue as a liability the applicable amount of foreign jurisdiction withholding taxes associated with such remittances. In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considered whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the U.S. and Canadian deferred tax assets will not be realizable. As the expectation of future taxable income resulting from the Synodex and Agility segments cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company maintains a valuation allowance against all the U.S. and Canadian net deferred tax assets. F-11 Table of Contents INNODATA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Company accounts for income taxes regarding uncertain tax positions, and recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Accounting for Leases - In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842),” as modified (“ASU 2016-02”), which replaced existing leasing rules with a comprehensive lease measurement and recognition standard and expanded disclosure requirements. ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets as liabilities, with corresponding “right-of-use” assets and is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Upon adoption, the Company recognized a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability. See Note 7, Operating Leases. The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at the inception date and requires an assessment of whether the fulfillment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets or the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset. A reassessment is made after inception of the lease only if one of the following applies: Whenever a reassessment is made, lease accounting shall commence or cease from the date when the change in circumstances gave rise to the reassessment for scenarios (a), (c) or (d) and at the date of renewal or extension period for scenario (b). Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as operating leases. As of December 31, 2021, all of the Company’s leases are classified under operating leases. Operating lease payments are recognized as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - The Company measures and recognizes stock-based compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors based on the estimated fair value at the grant date. The stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period. The fair value is determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The stock-based compensation expense related to the Company’s stock plans were allocated as follows (in thousands): ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Year Ended December 31, ​ 2021 2020 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Direct operating costs ​ $ 178 ​ $ 158 Selling and adminstrative expenses ​ 1,572 ​ 755 Total stock-based compensation ​ $ 1,750 ​ $ 913 ​ Fair Value of Financial Instruments - The carrying amounts of financial instruments approximated their fair value as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, because of the relative short maturity of these instruments. See Note 14, Derivatives. Fair value measurements and disclosures define fair value as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The accounting standard establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels. The three levels are defined as follows: F-12 Table of Contents INNODATA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Company’s forward contracts are at level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Accounts Receivable - The Company establishes credit terms for new clients based upon management’s review of their credit information and project terms, and performs ongoing credit evaluations of its clients, adjusting credit terms when management believes appropriate based upon payment history and an assessment of the client’s current creditworthiness. The Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its clients to make required payments. The Company determines its allowance by considering a number of factors, including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due (accounts outstanding longer than the payment terms are considered past due), the Company’s previous loss history, the client’s current ability to pay its obligation to the Company, and the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole. This cannot guarantee that credit loss rates in the future will not be greater than those experienced in the past. In addition, there is credit exposure if the financial condition of one of the Company’s major clients were to deteriorate. In the event that the financial condition of one of the Company’s clients were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be necessary. Concentration of Credit Risk - The Company maintains its cash with highly rated financial institutions, located in the United States and in foreign locations where the Company has its operations. At December 31, 2021, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $ 18.9 million, of which $ 12.6 million was held by its foreign subsidiaries with local banks located mainly in Asia and $ 6.3 million was held in the United States. To the extent that such cash exceeds the maximum insurance levels, the Company is uninsured. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts. Income (Loss) per Share – Income (loss) per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted income (loss) per share is computed by considering the impact of the potential issuance of common shares, using the treasury stock method, on the weighted average number of shares outstanding. For those securities that are not convertible into a class of common stock, the “two class” method of computing income (loss) per share is used. Pension - The Company records annual pension costs based on calculations, which include various actuarial assumptions including discount rates, compensation increases and other assumptions involving demographic factors. The Company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends. The Company believes that the assumptions used in recording its pension obligations are reasonable based on its experience, market conditions and inputs from its actuaries. Deferred Revenue - Deferred revenue represents payments received from clients in advance of providing services and amounts deferred if conditions for revenue recognition have not been met. Included in accrued expenses on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets is deferred revenue amounting to $ 4.5 million and $ 1.2 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 , respectively. We expect to recognize substantially all of these performance obligations over the next 12 months. Recent Accounting Pronouncements – In December 2019, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2019-12, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes” as part of its initiative to reduce complexity in the accounting standards. The standard eliminates certain exceptions related to the approach for intra-period tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. The standard also clarifies and simplifies other aspects of the accounting for income taxes. The standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020. The Company adopted the standard on January 1, 2021 and it had no material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. F-13 Table of Contents INNODATA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, “Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Statements” (“ASU 2016-13”). ASU 2016-13 requires a financial asset (or a group of financial assets) measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation amount that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset(s) to present the net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected on the financial asset. In November 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-19, “Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses,” which clarifies ASC Topic 326, “Financial Instruments – Credit Losses” and corrects unintended application of the guidance, and in November 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-11, “Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses,” which clarifies or addresses specific issues about certain aspects of ASU 2016-13. In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-03, “Codification Improvements to Financial Instruments,” which modifies the measurement of expected credit losses of certain financial instruments. ASU 2016-13 is effective for certain smaller reporting companies for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022 and interim periods within those fiscal years, which will be fiscal 2023 for the Company if it continues to be classified as a smaller reporting company, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect that the adoption of the new guidance will have a material impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements. ​ ​ 2. Property and equipment Property and equipment, which include amounts recorded under capital leases, are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization (in thousands), and consist of the following: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ December 31, ​ 2021 2020 Equipment ​ $ 12,834 ​ $ 11,199 Computer software ​ 4,399 ​ 5,186 Furniture and equipment ​ 1,397 ​ 1,437 Leasehold improvements ​ 3,287 ​ 3,267 Total ​ 21,917 ​ 21,089 Less: accumulated depreciation and amortization ​ ( 18,970 ) ​ ( 19,237 ) ​ ​ $ 2,947 ​ $ 1,852 ​ The estimated useful lives of the property and equipment range between two years and ten years .

Goodwill and Intangible Assets The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2021 was as follows (in thousands): ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Balance as of January 1, 2021 $ 2,150 Foreign currency translation adjustment ​ ( 7 ) Balance as of December 31, 2021 ​ $ 2,143 ​ On September 30, 2021, The Company performed its annual goodwill assessment for the Agility segment in accordance with the provisions of ASU 2017-04, by using a single-step approach that determines the carrying value of the reporting unit and compares it against the reporting unit’s fair value. The Company determined that there was no impairment of long-lived assets, tangible or intangible, in any reporting units as of September 30, 2021. The fair value measurement of goodwill for the Agility segment was classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy because the Company used the income approach, which utilizes significant inputs that are unobservable in the market and the market multiple approaches using comparable entities to further validate the carrying values. The Company believes it made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of the reporting unit as of the impairment test measurement date. The carrying value of Goodwill was $2.1 million as of December 31, 2021, and 2020. F-14 Table of Contents INNODATA INC.

The ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences are deductible and net operating losses are available. As of December 31, 2021, the Company continues to maintain a valuation allowance on all U.S. and Canadian net deferred tax assets. The Company maintained a valuation allowance of approximately $ 9.1 million and $ 7.9 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The valuation allowance relates to U.S. and the Company’s Canadian subsidiaries deferred tax assets. The net change in the total valuation allowance was an increase of $ 1.2 million and $ 1.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Despite the access to the overseas earnings and the resulting toll charge, the Company intends to indefinitely reinvest the foreign earnings in our foreign subsidiaries on account of the foreign jurisdiction withholding tax that the Company has to incur on the actual remittances. Unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries amounted to approximately $ 50.0 million at December 31, 2021. If such earnings are repatriated in the future, or are no longer deemed to be indefinitely reinvested, the Company would have to accrue the applicable amount of foreign jurisdiction withholding taxes associated with such remittances. United States and foreign components of income (loss) before provision for income taxes for each of the two years ended December 31, were as follows (in thousands): ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 2021 ​ 2020 United States ​ $ ( 261 ) ​ $ 930 Foreign ​ ( 702 ) ​ 115 Totals ​ $ ( 963 ) ​ $ 1,045 ​ At December 31, 2021, the Company had available U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $ 17.9 million. These net operating loss carryforwards expire at various times through the year 2035. F-17 Table of Contents INNODATA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS On March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was signed into law in response to U.S. businesses’ economic challenges. Under the CARES Act, the Internal Revenue Code was amended to allow for federal NOL carrybacks for five years to offset previous years taxable income or for the NOL to be carried forward indefinitely to offset 100% of taxable income for the tax year 2020 and 80% of taxable income for tax years 2021 and thereafter. As of the date the financial statements were issued, the state NOL carryforwards, if not utilized, will expire beginning in 2022. On December 31, 2021, the Company’s Canadian subsidiaries had available net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $ 20.6 million in Canada, which will begin to expire in 2028. The potential benefits from these balances have not been recognized for financial statement purposes. The Company had unrecognized tax benefits of $ 1.8 million and $ 3.2 million as of December 31, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The decrease in unrecognized tax benefits resulted from the reversal of a prior year’s accrual due to tax settlements. The Company expects that unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, if recognized, would have a material impact on the Company’s effective tax rate. The Company is subject to Federal income tax, as well as income tax in various states and foreign jurisdictions. The Company has open tax years for U.S. Federal and state taxes from 2016 through 2020. Various foreign subsidiaries have open tax years from 2003 through 2020, some of which are under audit by local tax authorities. The Company believes that its accruals for uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2021 under ASC 740, Income Taxes are adequate to cover the Company’s income tax exposures. The following table represents a roll forward of the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits and associated interest for the years ended in thousands: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Unrecognized Tax ​ ​ Benefits ​ ​ December 31, ​ 2021 2020 Balance at January 1 ​ $ 3,231 ​ $ 2,957 Decrease (increase) for prior year tax positions ​ ( 1,713 ) ​ 308 Increase (decrease) for current year tax positions ​ 156 ​ ( 161 ) Interest accrual ​ 111 ​ 199 Foreign currency remeasurement ​ ( 32 ) ​ ( 72 ) Balance at December 31 ​ $ 1,753 ​ $ 3,231 ​ Tax Assessments In September 2015, the Company’s Indian subsidiary was subject to an inquiry by the Service Tax Department in India regarding the classification of services provided by this subsidiary, asserting that the services provided by this subsidiary fall under the category of online information and database access or retrieval services (OID Services), and not under the category of business support services (BS Services) that are exempt from service tax as historically indicated in the subsidiary’s service tax filings. The Company disagrees with the Service Tax Department’s position. In November 2019, the Commissioner of Central Tax, GST & Central Excise issued an order confirming the Service Tax Department’s position. The Company is contesting this order in an appeal to the Customs, Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal. In the event the Service Tax Department is ultimately successful in proving that the services fall under the category of OID Services, the revenues earned by the Company’s Indian subsidiary for the period July 2012 through November 2016 would be subject to a service tax of between 12.36 % and 15 %, and this subsidiary may also be liable for interest and penalties. The revenue of the Company’s Indian subsidiary during this period was approximately $ 63.0 million. In accordance with new rules promulgated by the Service Tax Department, as of December 1, 2016 service tax is no longer applicable to OID or BS Services. Based on the Company’s assessment, in consultation with the Company’s tax counsel, the Company has not recorded any tax liability for this case. F-18 Table of Contents INNODATA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS In a separate action relating to service tax refunds, in October 2016, the Company’s Indian subsidiary received notices from the Indian Service Tax Department in India seeking to reverse service tax refunds of approximately $ 160,000 previously granted to our Indian subsidiary for three quarters in 2014, asserting that the services provided by this subsidiary fall under the category of OID Services and not BS Services. The appeal was determined in favor of the Service Tax Department. The Company disagrees with the basis of this decision and is contesting it. The Company expects delays in its Indian subsidiary receiving further service tax refunds until this matter is adjudicated with finality, and currently has service tax credits of approximately $ 1.0 million recorded as a receivable. Based on the Company’s assessment, in consultation with the Company’s tax counsel, the Company has not recorded any tax liability for this case. Substantial recovery against the Company in the above referenced 2015 Service Tax Department case could have a material adverse impact on the Company, and unfavorable rulings or recoveries in other tax proceedings could have a material adverse impact on the consolidated operating results of the period (and subsequent periods) in which the rulings or recovery occurs. ​ 5. Long-term obligations Total long-term obligations as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 consisted of the following (in thousands): ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ December 31, ​ 2021 2020 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Pension obligations - accrued pension liability ​ $ 6,839 ​ $ 5,940 Settlement agreement ​ ​ 272 ​ ​ 518 Capital lease obligations ​ ​ - ​ 209 Microsoft licenses ​ 385 ​ 747 Bank loans payable ​ - ​ 580 ​ ​ ​ 7,496 ​ 7,994 Less: Current portion of long-term obligations ​ 1,279 ​ 1,712 Totals ​ $ 6,217 ​ $ 6,282 ​ ​ 6. Commitments and contingencies Litigation – In 2008, a judgment was rendered in the Philippines against a Philippine subsidiary of the Company that is no longer active and purportedly also against Innodata Inc., in favor of certain former employees of the Philippine subsidiary. The potential payment amount aggregates to approximately $ 6.4 million, plus legal interest that accrued at 12% per annum from August 13, 2008 to June 30, 2013, and thereafter accrued and continues to accrue at 6% per annum . The potential payment amount as expressed in U.S. dollars varies with the Philippine peso to U.S. dollar exchange rate. In December 2017, a group of 97 of the former employees of the Philippine subsidiary indicated that they proposed to record the judgment as to themselves in New Jersey. In January 2018, in response to an action initiated by Innodata Inc., the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey (USDC) entered a preliminary injunction that enjoins these former employees from pursuing or seeking recognition or enforcement of the judgment against Innodata Inc. in the United States during the pendency of the action and until further order of the USDC. In June 2018, the USDC entered a consent order administratively closing the action subject to return of the action to the active docket upon the written request of Innodata Inc. or the former employees, with the USDC retaining jurisdiction over the matter and the preliminary injunction remaining in full force and effect. The Company is also subject to various other legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. While management currently believes that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position or overall trends in consolidated results of operations, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties. Substantial recovery against the Company in the above-referenced Philippine action could have a material adverse impact on the Company, and unfavorable rulings or recoveries in the other proceedings could have a material adverse impact on the consolidated operating results of the period in which the ruling or recovery occurs. In addition, the Company’s estimate of the potential impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position or overall consolidated results of operations for the above referenced legal proceedings could change in the future. F-19 Table of Contents INNODATA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Company’s legal accruals related to legal proceedings and claims are based on the Company’s determination of whether or not a loss is probable. The Company reviews outstanding proceedings and claims with external counsel to assess probability and estimates of loss. The accruals are adjusted if necessary. While the Company intends to defend these matters vigorously, adverse outcomes that it estimates could reach approximately $ 350,000 in the aggregate beyond recorded amounts are reasonably possible. If circumstances change, the Company may be required to record adjustments that could be material to its reported consolidated financial condition and results of operations. Foreign Currency - To the extent that the currencies of the Company’s production facilities located in the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka and Israel fluctuate, the Company is subject to risks of changing costs of production after pricing is established for certain client projects. In addition, the Company is exposed to the risk of foreign currency fluctuation on the non-U.S. dollar denominated revenues, and on the monetary assets and liabilities held by its foreign subsidiaries that are denominated in local currency. Indemnifications - The Company is obligated under certain circumstances to indemnify directors, officers and certain employees against costs and liabilities incurred in actions or threatened actions brought against such individuals because such individuals acted in the capacity of director, officer or fiduciary of the Company. In addition, the Company has contracts with certain clients pursuant to which the Company has agreed to indemnify the client for certain specified and limited claims. These indemnification obligations occur in the ordinary course of business and, in many cases, do not include a limit on potential maximum future payments. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has not recorded a liability for any obligations arising as a result of these indemnification obligations. ​ 7. Operating Leases The Company has various lease agreements for its offices and service delivery centers. The Company has determined that the risks and benefits related to the leased properties are retained by the lessors. Accordingly, these are accounted for as operating leases. These lease agreements are for terms ranging from two to eleven years and, in most cases, provide for rental escalations ranging from 1.75 % to 10 %. Most of these agreements are renewable at the mutual consent of the parties to the contract. The Company adopted ASU 2016-02 , effective January 1, 2019, and applied the practical expedients consistently for all of its leases. Accordingly, the Company: In addition, the Company elected to retrospectively determine the lease term and assess impairment of the right-of-use asset. Under the standard, the Company recognizes an operating lease liability and right-of-use asset. The amount of right-of use asset is equal to the present value of the remaining lease payments discounted using the incremental borrowing rate of each respective country. Modifications, if any are recalculated and corresponding adjustments are made to the carrying values of both the lease liability and right-of-use assets. A right-of-use asset is measured as the amount of the lease liability adjusted for the amount of deferred straight-line rent, prepaid rent and lease incentive allowances previously recognized. The table below summarizes the amounts recognized in the financial statements related to operating leases for the years presented (in thousands): ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Year Ended ​ December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Rent expense for long-term operating leases ​ $ 1,560 ​ $ 1,667 Rent expense for short-term leases ​ 229 ​ 619 Total rent expense ​ $ 1,789 ​ $ 2,286 ​ F-20 Table of Contents INNODATA INC.

Pension Benefits U.S. Defined Contribution Pension Plan – The Company has a defined contribution plan qualified under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, pursuant to which substantially all of its U.S. employees are eligible to participate after completing six months of service. Participants may elect to contribute a portion of their compensation to the plan. Under the plan, the Company has the discretion to match a portion of participants’ contributions. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company did not make any matching contributions. Most of the non-U.S. subsidiaries provide for government-mandated defined pension benefits. For certain of these subsidiaries, vested eligible employees are provided a lump sum payment upon retiring from the Company at a defined age. The lump sum amount is based on the salary and tenure as of retirement date. Other non-U.S. subsidiaries provide for a lump sum payment to vested employees on retirement, death, incapacitation or termination of employment, based upon the salary and tenure as of the date employment ceases. The liability for such defined benefit obligations is determined and provided on the basis of actuarial valuations. As of December 31, 2021, these plans were unfunded. Pension expense for foreign subsidiaries totaled approximately $ 0.9 million and $ 0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Stock Options On June 7, 2016, stockholders of the Company approved amendments to the Innodata Inc. 2013 Stock Plan (as amended, the “Plan”). The number of shares of common stock of Innodata Inc. that may be delivered, purchased or used for reference purposes (with respect to stock appreciation rights or stock units) for awards granted under the Plan after June 7, 2016 is 5,858,892 (the Share Reserve). Shares subject to an option or stock appreciation right granted under the Plan after June 7, 2016 count against the Share Reserve as one share for every share granted, and shares subject to any other type of award granted under the Plan after June 7, 2016 count against the Share Reserve as two shares for every share granted. Any award, or portion of an award, under the Plan or under the Company’s 2009 Stock Plan (as amended and restated (the Prior Plan)) that expires or terminates unexercised, becomes unexercisable or is forfeited or otherwise terminated, surrendered or canceled as to any shares without delivery of shares or other consideration will be added back to the Share Reserve as one share for each such share that was subject to an option or stock appreciation right granted under the Plan or the Prior Plan, and two shares for each such share that was subject to an award other than an option or stock appreciation right granted under the Plan or the Prior Plan. If any shares are withheld, tendered or exchanged by a participant in the Plan as full or partial payment to Innodata of the exercise price under an option under the Plan or the Prior Plan or in satisfaction of a participant’s tax withholding obligations with respect to any award under the Plan or the Prior Plan, there will be added back to the Share Reserve one share for each such share that was withheld, tendered or exchanged in respect of an option or stock appreciation right granted under the Plan or the F-23 Table of Contents INNODATA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Prior Plan, and two shares for each such share that was withheld, tendered or exchanged in respect of an award other than an option or stock appreciation right granted under the Plan or the Prior Plan. On June 8, 2021, stockholders of the Company approved the Innodata Inc. 2021 Equity Compensation Plan (the “2021 Plan”). The number of shares of common stock of Innodata Inc. that may be delivered, purchased or used for reference purposes (with respect to stock appreciation rights or stock units) for awards granted under the 2021 Plan is 1,800,000 (the “Share Reserve”). Shares subject to an option or stock appreciation right granted under the 2021 Plan count against the Share Reserve as one share for every share granted, and shares subject to any other type of award granted under the 2021 Plan count against the Share Reserve as two shares for every share granted. Any shares withheld, tendered or exchanged by a participant in the 2021 Plan as full or partial payment to Innodata of the exercise price under an option under the 2021 Plan or in satisfaction of a participant’s tax withholding obligations with respect to any award under the 2021 Plan, will not be added back to the Share Reserve. The fair value of stock options is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The weighted-average fair value of the options granted and weighted-average assumptions were as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ For the Years Ended December 31, ​ ​ 2021 ​ 2020 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Weighted average fair value of options granted $ 3.73 $ 0.61 ​ Risk-free interest rate ​ 0.22 % - 0.82 % 0.29 %- 0.56 % Expected life (years) ​ 3 - 6 ​ 5 - 6 ​ Expected volatility factor ​ 58 % - 68 % 46.75 %- 50.09 % Expected dividends ​ None ​ None ​ ​ The Company estimates the risk-free interest rate using the U.S. Treasury yield curve for periods equal to the expected term of the options in effect at the time of grant. The expected term of options granted is based on a combination of vesting schedules, term of the options and historical experience. Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the Company’s common stock. The Company uses an expected dividend yield of zero since it has never declared or paid any dividends on its capital stock.

Diluted income per share is computed by considering the impact of the potential issuance of common shares, using the treasury stock method, on the weighted average number of shares outstanding. For those securities that are not convertible into a class of common stock, the two-class method of computing loss per share is used. Options to purchase 5.5 million shares of common stock for the year ended December 31, 2021 were outstanding but not included in the computation of diluted loss per share because the effect would have been anti-dilutive. Options to purchase 1.6 million shares of common stock for the year ended December 31, 2020, were outstanding but not included in the computation of diluted income per share because the exercise price of the options were greater than the average market price of the common shares and therefore have not been considered as potential equity shares. ​ 14. Derivatives The Company conducts a large portion of its operations in international markets which subject it to foreign currency fluctuations. The most significant foreign currency exposures occur when revenue and associated accounts receivable are collected in one currency and expenses to generate that revenue are incurred in another currency. The Company is also subject to wage inflation and other government mandated increases and operating expenses in Asian countries where the Company has the majority of its operations. The Company’s primary inflation and exchange rate exposure relates to payroll, other payroll costs and operating expenses in the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka and Israel. In addition, although most of the Company’s revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars, a significant portion of total revenues is denominated in Canadian dollars, Pound Sterling and Euros. The Company’s policy is to enter derivative instrument contracts with terms that coincide with the underlying exposure being hedged for a period up to 12 months. As such, the Company’s derivative instruments are expected to be highly effective. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the entire change in fair value of the hedging instrument is recorded to Other comprehensive income (loss). Upon settlement of these contracts, the change in the fair value recorded in Other comprehensive income (loss) are reclassified to earnings and included as part of Direct operating costs. For derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, any change in fair value is recorded directly in earnings as part of Direct operating costs. The Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking hedge transactions. The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. All derivatives are recognized at their fair value and classified based on the instrument’s maturity date.

Business. Business Overview Innodata Inc. (NASDAQ: INOD) (including its subsidiaries, the “Company”, “Innodata”, “we”, “us” or “our”) is a global data engineering company. We solve complex data challenges using artificial intelligence (AI) and human expertise. We provide large-scale data annotation services and platforms to companies who require high-quality data for training AI and machine learning (ML) algorithms. We also provide AI/ML-based solutions to help companies apply AI/ML to real-world problems relating to analyzing and deriving insights from documents. For industry-specific, document-intensive industry use cases, we provide AI-augmented software-as-a-service (SaaS) platforms and discrete managed services. Our platforms and services are powered by Goldengate, our proprietary AI/ML platform, as well as other technologies we have developed. In addition, we bring to bear 3,500 + employees spanning nine countries with expertise in data pertaining to many professional fields. Our hybrid approach of using AI/ML in conjunction with human experts enables us to deliver superior data quality with even the most complex and sensitive data. We developed our capabilities and honed our customer- and quality-centric culture progressively over the last 30 years creating high-quality data for many of the world’s most demanding information companies. Approximately five years ago, we formed Innodata Labs, a research and development center, to research, develop and apply machine learning and emerging AI to our large-scale, human-intensive data operations. In 2019, we began packaging the capabilities that emerged from our R&D efforts in order to align with several fast-growing new markets and help companies use AI/ML to drive performance benefits and business insights. We anticipate this strategy will enable us to accelerate growth. Market Opportunities Data Annotation Companies across industry verticals are increasingly seeking to develop AI-based applications for an ever-increasing variety of use cases such as self-driving cars, surveillance systems, automated medical diagnostics, digital assistants and chatbots and contract review. These applications depend upon high-performing AI algorithms in areas such as speech recognition, image recognition, and text recognition. Unlike traditional computer applications that are programmed in languages like Python and Java to tell computers what to do, AI applications can be created with little to no programming. Instead, AI applications are trained with large quantities of input data and expected output data. Leveraging such data, the AI application learns on its own from the data itself through a series of regressions. Developing high-quality training data is critical for the AI to perform correctly, but often requires technology and skilled human resources that data science teams lack. Moreover, developing high-quality data takes up 80% of the time for most AI and ML projects. 1 We train AI algorithms for social media companies, robotics companies, financial services companies, and many others, working with images, text, video and audio. Data sciences teams seek partners that can perform data preparation functions for them at large-scale and at high quality, while using automated tools to minimize cost. Moreover, as AI projects become more specialized and mission-critical, data preparation is becoming increasingly complex, requiring deep domain knowledge and an infrastructure in which data security is assured. We believe that Innodata is ideally situated to be such a partner. 1 Cognilytica Research, Data Engineering, Preparation, and Labeling for AI in 2019 (January 31, 2019) 4 We utilize a variety of leading third-party image and video annotation tools. For text, we use our proprietary text annotation platform that incorporates AI to reduce cost while improving consistency and quality of output. Our proprietary text annotation platform features auto-tagging capabilities that apply to both classical and generative AI tasks. It also encapsulates many of the innovations we have conceived of in the course of our 30-year history of creating high-quality data. We are developing a new version of our text annotation platform for customer use which we anticipate will be a source of competitive differentiation and potential SaaS licensing revenue. The AI data training market is estimated at $1.9 billion this year and is expected to grow to $3.2 billion by 2023, 2 essentially proxying the enormous growth expected in AI overall ($18 billion in 2020, $44 billion in 2024, a 24% CAGR). 3 Similarly, the global data annotation tools market was valued at $695 million in 2019, projected to reach $6.5 billion by 2027, which is a CAGR of 33%. 4 AI/ML Solutions We also provide AI/ML solutions to companies that intensively process textual data and seek to obtain the benefits of AI/ML technologies without having to develop AI/ML engineering capabilities in-house. For such companies, we often integrate one or more of our pre-trained text processing algorithms as a foundation for an overall solution. Our algorithms are accessible as microservices via application programming interfaces (APIs), enabling easy integration. In conjunction with AI/ML solutions, we often provide a range of data engineering support services, including data transformation, data curation, data hygiene, data consolidation, data compliance, and master data management. Our customers span a diverse range of industries and a wide range of AI use cases, benefiting from the short time-to-value and high economic returns our AI/ML solutions provide. The AI solutions market is expected to grow at a 24% CAGR reaching $44 billion in 2024. The document analytics market - a subset of the overall AI solutions market - is also fast-moving and dynamic, expected to grow at a CAGR of 48% from 2020 to 2027, reaching $12 billion by 2027. 5 Meanwhile, overall enterprise AI spend that is projected to reach $53.06 billion by 2026, registering a CAGR of 35.4% from 2019 to 2026. 6 AI/ML Industry Platforms Our industry platforms address specific, niche market requirements that we believe we can fulfill in large part with our AI/ML technologies. We deploy these industry platforms as software-as-a-service (SaaS) and as managed services. To date, we have built an industry platform for medical records data extraction and transformation (which we brand as “Synodex ® ”) and for marketing communications/public relations news distribution and monitoring (which we brand as “Agility PR Solutions”). 2 Cognilytica Research, Data Engineering, Preparation, and Labeling for AI 2020 (January 31, 2020) 3 IDC, Worldwide Artificial Intelligence Systems Spending Guide, September 2019. 4 ""Data Annotation Tools Market to 2027 - Global Analysis and Forecasts by Type ; Annotation Type ; End-user"" (ReportLinker, March 2020). 5 “Document Analytics Market by Product Type (Solution and Services), Deployment Type, Industry Vertical (BFSI, Government, Healthcare, Retail and ecommerce, Manufacturing, Transportation), Organization Size, and Region - Global Forecast to 2027” (Meticulous Research®, December 2020) 6 Allied Market Research, Enterprise Artificial Intelligence (AI) Market Outlook-2026 (2020) 5 Our Synodex industry platform transforms medical records into useable digital data organized in accordance with our proprietary data models or client data models. At the end of 2020, we had 20 clients utilizing our Synodex platform, including John Hancock Insurance, the insurance operating unit of John Hancock Financial (a division of Manulife) and one of the largest life insurers in the United States. As we further integrate AI into the platform, we aim to address the needs of the healthcare sector, which is increasingly seeking to search, analyze, and interpret vast volumes of patient data, improve clinical documentation and make computer-assisted coding more efficient. The global artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare market is forecast to reach a market size of $62 billion by 2027, up from $3 billion this year, with a CAGR of 43.6%. 7 Our Agility industry platform provides marketing communications and public relations professionals with the ability to target and distribute content to journalists and social media influencers world-wide and to monitor and analyze global news (print, web, radio and TV) and social media. Agility is now ranked by software review site G2 Crowd as meeting the requirements of customers better than its two largest competitors that have combined revenues of over $1 billion. 8 Agility operates in the $4.5 billion media intelligence solutions market. 9 The Company’s operations are presently classified and reported in three reporting segments: Digital Data Solutions (DDS), Synodex and Agility. Competitive Strengths Our Data Quality We believe we achieve industry-leading data quality by leveraging our technology, our large staff of human experts, and the culture we have cultivated over many years of providing high-quality data to the most demanding customers. For the past five years, we have been designing and refining our approach for combining human experts and AI to produce large-scale, highly accurate data. In our approach, AI networks automatically perform much of the required processing and human experts perform processing that the AI cannot perform at a high level of confidence. The human output is fed back into the AI networks, which, as a result, “learn” and become “smarter” over time, achieving progressively greater levels of automation while maintaining the highest levels of quality. ( See “Our Technology”, below. ) Our 3,500+ experts have deep domain knowledge in a wide diversity of data domains. They are selected on the basis of data acumen, analytical ability, and deep domain proficiency. ( See “Our Domain Experts”, below. ) Our culture of quality is critical to achieving and sustaining high data quality. Our culture has been cultivated over our decades of experience performing data-related tasks for leading global companies, including the four largest global information companies with which we have 10-plus year relationships building and maintaining many of their leading data products. 7 Artificial Intelligence In Healthcare Market By Offering (Hardware, Software), By Technology (Machine Learning, Context-Aware Computing, Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision), By End-Use (Hospitals & Healthcare Providers), and Region Forecast To 2027 (Reports and Data, January 2021) 8 https://www.agilitypr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/g2-compare-agility-cision-meltwater-210312.pdf 9 Burton-Taylor, Media Intelligence and public Relations Software/Information Global Share & Segment Sizing 2020 (May 2020) 6 We maintain independent quality assurance centers that comply with and are certified to the ISO 9001:2008 quality management system standards. Our Domain Experts We have over 3,500+ employees with deep data domain expertise in various fields, including law, sciences, health, finance, and technology. Many of them hold advanced degrees. They process data in over 25 languages. Most work from our global operations centers in India, Israel, Germany, Sri Lanka and the Philippines. For annotating complex or sensitive data, our expert staff provides an attractive alternative to the crowdsourced labor pools utilized by many of our competitors typically for mundane tasks. They are especially well-suited for high-context data, such as legal contract classification, medical images, medical records, and scientific and legal literature. Our Technology Over the past four years, we have built a technology infrastructure that automates complex data annotation and other data engineering tasks. Our technology infrastructure combines advanced dataflow, deep learning (a branch of AI), and purpose-built applications used by human experts, which we refer to as “workbenches”. This infrastructure enables us to perform data annotation and other data engineering tasks at progressively higher levels of efficiency without compromising quality as it continuously learns from human experts. Our proprietary, state-of-the-art Goldengate platform is our core AI technology stack. Goldengate accepts a wide range of documents –including images, PDFs, and web copy – and performs a series of cognitive tasks to extract intelligence and create analytical data that people can use for generating inferences and powering analytical applications. It serves up no-code AI with transfer learning built on generative language models we have developed over the past five years of deploying industrial deep neural networks. Goldengate serves as the foundational technology for the AI projects we perform for customers, as well as the AI-under-the-hood that powers our data annotation platform and our industry platforms. One of the main benefits of the platform is that it’s “no-code”, so it doesn’t require a large number of data scientists to build models or require a data science platform to orchestrate models and update models. Using Goldengate in combination with our SMEs, we are able to build high-performing, cutting-edge models that address real-world problems. Our 2021 journey is to further AI-enable Synodex, Agility and our data annotation platform using Goldengate; in 2022, we intend to commercialize it further as both a customer-facing technology and as the engine under other potential industry solutions. Goldengate functionality can be consumed as domain-specific and task-specific microservices each of which performs a discrete data-related task automatically. Each AI microservice may be invoked by the dataflow via a RESTful API. Many complex data problems can be solved with a combination of these microservices. Capabilities include deep sequence labelling, categorization, segmentation and sequence-to-sequence mapping. For each cognitive task an AI microservice performs, it provides a confidence score. A confidence score at or above an established accuracy threshold means no human expert review is required. A confidence score below an established accuracy threshold means human expert review is required. When expert review is required, the dataflow automatically routes data to an appropriate human expert. Our human experts use workbenches that enable them to quickly and efficiently review the data and make judgements. The workbenches then retroactively feed back the expert-reviewed work into Goldengate’s deep neural network, enabling it to learn and become smarter. This feature is commonly known as “human-in-the-loop”. It results in continuous, predictable improvement and progressively greater levels of automation. 7 To support our Agility industry platform, we have built a fully scalable, cloud-based infrastructure that powers a SaaS experience for global clients on a 24/7 basis. It includes (i) an AI/ML-powered big data media intelligence platform that indexes two billion media items per year, powering media monitoring, media enrichment, and media database APIs; (ii) a full targeting workflow platform that integrates media targeting, content curation, content distribution, integrated newswires, and a newsroom; (iii) a comprehensive database of more than one million global media influencers and journalists; (iv) a media monitoring and analytics engine; and (v) a workflow platform for media database research combining AI and machine learning to streamline research workflows for discovery and maintenance of our database. To support our Synodex intelligent automation platform, we have built technologies for transforming imaged medical records and HL7/FHIR electronic health records (EHR) systems into digital data conforming to proprietary insurance medical data dictionaries that span diseases and impairments, diagnostic tests, pharmacology and support industry standard codes such as ICD-10 as well as rules engines for processing, analyzing and displaying the digital data. Our Infrastructure Our infrastructure supports a range of strategies to suit our clients’ requirements for data security, compliance, scalability and reliability. We host data and applications in our own data centers at our operations centers, in our clients’ data centers, and on third-party cloud services that provide the benefit of “infinite scalability” of hardware resources. Our data operations are linked by multiple redundant network connections. Our Wide Area Network – along with our Local Area Networks, Storage Area Networks, Network Attached Storage and data centers – are configured with industry standard redundancy, often with more than one backup to establish 24x7 availability. In 2020, our Wide Area Network had 99.96% uptime excluding scheduled maintenance. We encrypt all sensitive information, both at rest and in transit, to the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 256 or similar standard, and we employ a range of security features, including industry-leading managed firewalls and intrusion detection and prevention services. ( See “Information Security”, below. ) Our Breath of Capabilities We are able to address clients at their highest point of need. For example, we may provide data annotation for a data sciences team at a bank that is building an AI application to manage complex loan agreements. For another banking client with the same requirement but without a sophisticated data sciences team, we might provide a full AI/ML solution built on our proprietary Goldengate AI platform that extracts key data points from the loan agreements and outputs normalized digital data via an API to the bank’s existing application. For still another banking client that also lacked such an application, we might provide a data analytics platform. Data science teams that utilize our data annotation services also often have other related needs that include data transformation, data curation, data hygiene, data consolidation, data compliance, and master data management. Unlike many of our data annotation competitors – that are essentially staffing companies – as a full-service data engineering company we are able to address these attendant requirements. Our Outcomes Orientation We have developed a strong customer-centric culture and a set of values designed around achieving promised outcomes for our clients. This includes proactive communication, innovation, transparency, and empathy. 8 Growth Strategy Our strategy for growth is to align to and serve large, dynamic and rapidly growing markets related to the deployment of AI/ML in businesses. Our solutions and platforms leverage the technology, human resources, and culture of fanaticism for data quality that we have developed over the past 30 years, as well as the AI/ML research and development we have invested in over the past five years. We intend to invest significantly in scaling our sales and marketing. Through most of 2020, we had 15 people in sales. Our 2021 budget, by contrast, anticipates ending 2021 with a sales team of 98 in total: 63 sales executives; 25 business development resources; and 10 sales managers and sales enablement directors. We expect this will deliver significant returns in future years. We also plan to continue to invest in our proprietary text annotation platform and Goldengate AI/ML platform as sources of competitive advantage. We also plan to invest in building a proprietary resource management platform geared specifically to managing remote staff and freelancers. Prior to the global pandemic, our operating model was to almost exclusively use full-time employees working from large production centers. Propelled by the need to shift to remote working, we are presently near 100% cloud-based and remote, which has enabled us to lower fixed operating costs and achieve greater scalability. We expect to fully fund these investments for growth from our internal resources without need for outside financing. Our Customers Our customers include leading businesses across multiple verticals including banking, insurance, financial services, technology, digital retailing and information/media. One client in the DDS segment generated approximately 14% and 16% of the Company’s total revenues in the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Another client in the DDS segment generated 10% of the Company’s total revenues for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. No other client accounted for 10% or more of total revenues during these periods. Further, in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, revenues from non-US clients accounted for 54% and 55%, respectively, of the Company's revenues. We have long-standing relationships with many of our clients, and we have provided services to the two clients referenced in the preceding paragraph for over ten years. Our track record of delivering high-quality services helps us to solidify client relationships. Many of our clients are recurring clients, meaning that they have continued to provide additional projects to us after our initial engagement with them. Our agreements with our clients are in many cases terminable on 30 to 90 days’ notice. A substantial portion of the services we provide to our clients is subject to their requirements. Sales and Marketing We market and sell our solutions and platforms directly through our professional staff, senior management and direct sales personnel operating primarily from various locations in the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom and Europe. In addition, we are increasingly developing and expanding our use of strategic partnerships and channel relationships for the establishment and development of new and existing clients. In addition to our executive-level business development professionals and sales and marketing personnel, we also deploy solutions architects, technical support experts and consultants who support the development of new clients and new client engagements. These resources work within teams (both permanent and ad hoc) that provide support to clients. 9 Our marketing department and sales professionals work together to generate leads. Our sales professionals identify and qualify prospects, securing direct personal access to decision makers at existing and prospective clients. They facilitate interactions between client personnel and our service teams to define ways in which we can assist clients with their goals. For each prospective client engagement, we assemble a team of our senior employees drawn from various disciplines within our Company. The team members assume assigned roles in a formalized process, using their combined knowledge and experience to understand the client’s goals and collaborate with the client on a solution. Our marketing organization is responsible for developing and increasing the visibility and awareness of our brand and our service offerings, defining and communicating our value proposition, generating qualified, early-stage leads and furnishing effective sales support tools. As part of our marketing strategy, we partner with media organizations to build awareness, establish a reputation as an industry thought leader and generate leads. Media partners include trade associations and publications, trade show producers and consulting organizations. These partnerships are particularly valuable in enterprise industries as we build our presence among digital content leaders and decision makers. Primary marketing outreach activities include content marketing, event marketing (including exhibiting at trade shows, virtual summits, conferences and seminars), direct and database marketing, public and media relations (including speaking engagements), and web marketing (including integrated marketing campaigns, search engine optimization, search engine marketing and the maintenance and continued development of external websites). Sales activities include lead generation, nurturing leads, engaging in discussions with prospective clients to understand their needs, demonstrating our products, designing solutions, responding to requests for proposals, and managing account and client relationships and activities. Personnel from our solutions analysis group, our client services group and our engineering services group closely support our direct sales effort. These individuals assist the sales force in understanding the technical needs of clients and providing responses to these needs, including demonstrations, prototypes, pricing quotations and time estimates. In addition, account managers from our client service group support our direct sales effort by providing ongoing project-level support to our clients. Competition Major competitors across industry verticals include Amazon Sagemaker Ground Truth, Appen, CloudFactory, Defined Crowd, Deepen.ai, Lionbridge, Samasource, Scale AI, , several of which are large firms with established client bases, as well as technology service providers such as Cognizant Technology Solutions, ExlService Holdings, Inc., Genpact Limited, Infosys, and Tata Consultancy Services. We compete in the data engineering market by offering high-quality services and competitive pricing that leverage our technical platforms, IT infrastructure, offshore domain experts and economies of scale. Our competitive advantages are especially attractive to clients for undertakings that are complex, mission-critical, sizable in scope or scale, or that require high levels of information security. 10 Each of our industry platforms has its discrete set of competitors. Major competitors for our Synodex industry platform are Risk Righter, eNoah, Parameds and a few BPO companies, several of which are large firms with established client bases. We also compete with in-house personnel at existing or prospective clients who may attempt to duplicate our services in-house or use alternative approaches to fulfill their needs. Our Agility industry platform competes with Meltwater, Cision, Kantar, and Intrado, several of which are large firms with established client bases, as well as PR firms that provide media monitoring and analysis services and journalist and influencer databases. Our competitors also include social media listening companies and start-ups offering platforms to amplify messages by targeting social media influencers. Intellectual Property Innodata depends, in part, upon its proprietary technologies and methodologies, including its Goldengate AI/ML platform, various applications of its platforms, its proprietary data models and other intellectual property rights. Innodata has a patent and several patent applications pending and believes that the duration of these patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of their applications. Innodata relies on a combination of trade secret, license, nondisclosure and other contractual agreements and copyright and trademark laws to protect its intellectual property rights. Innodata enters into confidentiality agreements with its employees, contractors and clients, and limits access to and distribution of Innodata’s and Innodata’s clients’ proprietary information. Innodata cannot assure that these arrangements will be adequate to deter misappropriation of its proprietary information or that it will be able to detect unauthorized use and take appropriate steps to enforce its intellectual property rights. Information Security Our operations facilities and data centers in Asia are certified to information security management standard - ISO27001. We employ a range of standard security features, such as two-factor authentication, patch management, anti-virus with IDS/IPS capability, redundant firewalls with intrusion detection and prevention features, and utilize appropriately certified cloud resources. When we are processing sensitive information, we utilize U.S.-based, co-located data centers or HIPAA compliant cloud computing services with advanced data encryption (AES 256 or comparable applied to data at rest and in motion). Secure desktop virtualization technologies are used for safeguarding against data leaving secured environments in the USA. Government Regulation We are subject to a number of U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations that relate to our business, including those governing privacy and data protection. We comply with the requirements of the United States Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 as amended (including by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Data (HITECH)) (HIPAA), the United Kingdom’s General Data Protection Regulation as tailored by the Data Protection Act 2018, the EU General Data Protection Regulation, and local laws regulating data privacy, as applicable. We are certified to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework. 11 Research and Development Our Innodata Labs researches and develops AI-based technologies that we utilize in our operations and with our clients. The Innodata Labs team is comprised of data scientists, including data scientists who have published leading papers on discrete topics in data science and have earned PhD degrees in fields such as data entity extraction. Environmental, Social, and Governance We are values-driven company, committed to continuously improving how we perform as a steward of nature, manage relationships with our employees, suppliers, customers and communities, and conduct our business. While we are driven by the vision of ushering in the promise of digital data and ubiquitous AI, we are cognizant that the disruption AI will inevitably cause will not be equitably distributed. Ironically, many of the communities in which we source human capital for AI projects – communities in India, the Philippines, and Sri Lanka – are also more heavily dependent on manual labor and face greater potential disruption as a result of AI. Therefore, as we set out on our AI journey five years ago, we made a concomitant commitment to do our part to help economically disadvantaged youth (especially young women) in these communities become technology-savvy. It was our aspiration that they become empowered beneficiaries of an AI-enabled world rather than its victims. From 2016 to 2020, our employees have contributed over 1,400 person days to our I-Hope program, and we have contributed resources, to build 12 fully-functional computer labs at schools across India, the Philippines, and Sri Lanka. We take immense pride knowing that as a result of our work 4,426 more children are now technology proficient and ready to take on challenges of navigating an increasingly AI-enabled world. In 2020, we were the proud recipients of the Asia CEO Awards Circle of Excellence for this work followed by DSWD Philippines (Department of Social Welfare & Development) Regional Citation Award. Our goal is to technology-enable 12,000 children by 2025, and we will be devoting a portion of our revenue to this worthy goal. Employees As of December 31, 2020, we employed 169 persons in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, and 3,600 persons in global delivery centers in the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka, Canada, Germany, and Israel, and 3,711 of our employees are full-time. Many of our employees hold advanced degrees in law, business, technology, medicine, and social sciences. No employees are currently represented by a labor union, and we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory. Corporate Offices Our principal executive offices are located at 55 Challenger Road, Ridgefield Park, New Jersey 07660, just outside New York City, and our telephone number is (201) 371-8000. We have an additional office location in Ottawa, Canada. We have six operations centers in the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka, Germany, and Israel. We were founded in 1988. Our website is www.innodata.com; information contained on our website is not included as a part of, or incorporated by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K. There we make available, free of charge, our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file that material with, or furnish it to, the SEC. Our SEC reports can be obtained through the Investor Relations section of our website or from the Securities and Exchange Commission at www.sec.gov . 12 Item 1A. Risk Factors. The risk factors set forth below describe what the Company believes to be the material factors, risks, and uncertainties related to our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The risks and uncertainties set forth below, as well as other factors described elsewhere in this Form 10-K or in other filings by the Company with the SEC, could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to the Company or that are not currently believed by the Company to be material may also harm the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. Risks Related to Our Business and Operations We have historically relied on a very limited number of clients that have accounted for a significant portion of our revenues, and our results of operations could be adversely affected if we were to lose one or more of these significant clients. We have historically relied on a very limited number of clients that have accounted for a significant portion of our revenues. One client in the DDS segment generated approximately 14% and 16% of the Company’s total revenues in the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Another client in the DDS segment generated 10% of the Company’s total revenues for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. No other client accounted for 10% or more of total revenues during these periods. Further, in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, revenues from non-US clients accounted for 54% and 55%, respectively, of the Company's revenues. We may lose any of these clients, or our other major clients, as a result of our failure to meet or satisfy our client’s requirements, the completion or termination of a project or engagement, or the client’s selection of another service provider. 13 In addition, the volume of work performed for our major clients may vary from year to year, and services they require from us may change from year to year. They may also request that we modify certain key terms of our agreements with them as a condition of continuing to do business with us. If the volume of work performed for our major clients varies, if the services they require from us change, or if they require price concessions, our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected, and we may incur a loss from operations. If certain key terms of our agreements with our major clients are modified, our revenues and results of operations may be adversely affected. Our services are typically subject to client requirements, and in many cases are terminable upon 30 to 90 days’ notice. The loss of these clients or a significant variation in the volume of work performed for these clients may have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition and results of operations. A portion of our services is provided on a non-recurring basis for specific projects, and our inability to replace large projects when they are completed or otherwise terminated has adversely affected, and could in the future adversely affect, our revenues and results of operations. We provide a portion of our services for specific projects that generate revenues that terminate on completion of a defined task. While we seek, whenever possible, on completion or termination of large projects, to counterbalance periodic declines in revenues with new arrangements to provide services to the same client or others, our inability to obtain sufficient new projects to counterbalance any decreases in such work may adversely affect our future revenues and results of operations. New acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic investments or partnerships could harm our operating results. We may pursue acquisitions, joint ventures or engage in strategic investments or partnerships to grow and enhance our capabilities. There can be no assurance that we will successfully consummate any acquisitions or joint ventures, or realize profit from strategic investments, or achieve desired financial and operating results. Further, such activities involve a number of risks and challenges, including proper evaluation, diversion of management’s attention and proper integration with our current business. Accordingly, we might fail to realize the expected benefits or strategic objectives of any such venture we undertake. If we are unable to complete the kind of acquisitions for which we plan, we may not be able to achieve our planned rates of growth, profitability or competitive position in specific markets or services. Our new clients may sunset their products because of lack of sufficient revenues or declining revenues, and this may result in termination of our work for these clients. As we obtain new opportunities and win new business, our clients may not generate the level of revenues that we initially anticipated at the time of signing a contract with them, or our clients may experience declining revenues with their existing products. This could be due to various reasons beyond our or their control, and it could lead to termination of projects or contracts. As we normally invest in people and technology and incur other costs in anticipation of revenues, any such deviation from our expected plan or anticipated results could impact our margins and earnings. Our business will suffer if we fail to develop new solutions and products and enhance our existing services, solutions and products in order to keep pace with the rapidly evolving technological environment or to provide new offerings, which may not succeed. The information technology and consulting services industries are characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, changing client preferences, new product and service introductions and the emergence of new vendors with lean cost and flexible cost models. Our future success will depend on our ability to develop products and solutions that keep pace with changes in our addressable markets, such as when we re-designed our solutions and product portfolio in 2019. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in developing new products and solutions, addressing evolving technologies on a timely or cost-effective basis or, if these products and solutions are developed, that we will be successful in the marketplace. We also cannot guarantee that we will be able to compete effectively with new vendors offering lean cost and flexible cost models, or that products, services or technologies developed by others will not render our products and solutions non-competitive or obsolete. Our failure to address these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 14 We operate in highly competitive markets. While we invest in developing and pursuing new solutions and product offerings from time to time, our profitability could be reduced if these solutions and products do not yield the profit margins we expect, or if the new offerings do not generate the planned revenues. The markets for our services, products and solutions are highly competitive. Some of our competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, human, technical and other resources and greater name recognition than we do. There are relatively few barriers preventing companies from entering the markets in which we operate. As a result, new market entrants also pose a threat to our business. We also compete with in-house personnel at current and prospective clients, who may attempt to duplicate our offerings using their own personnel. We have made and continue to make significant investments towards building-out new capabilities to pursue growth. These investments increase our costs, and if these services do not yield the revenues or profit margins we expect, and we are unable to grow our business and revenue proportionately, our profitability may be reduced, or we may incur losses. If we are not able to compete effectively in the markets we serve or if we are not able to develop new solutions and product offerings, our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected. We depend on third-party technology in the provision of our services. We rely upon certain software that we license from third parties, including software integrated with our internally developed software used in the provision of our services. These third-party software licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable or competitive terms, if at all. The loss of, or inability to maintain or obtain any of these software licenses, could result in delays in the provision of our services until we develop, identify, license and integrate equivalent software. Any delay in the provision of our services could damage our business and adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, our Company utilizes third party data centers to serve our clients and generate revenue. Any disruption in the provision of services from these data centers could result in loss of revenue, client dissatisfaction and loss of clients. Our Agility segment relies on third parties to provide certain content and data for our solutions. The cessation by third parties to provide their content has adversely affected, and could in the future adversely affect, our revenue and results of operations. Our Agility segment relies on third parties to provide or make available certain data for our information databases and our news and social media monitoring service. These third parties, in the past, have restricted access to certain content and may not renew agreements to provide content to us or may increase the price they charge for their content. Additionally, the quality of the content provided to us may not be acceptable to us and we may need to enter into agreements with additional third parties. In the event we are unable to use or have access to such third-party content or are unable to enter into agreements with new third parties, current clients may discontinue their relationship with us, and it may be difficult to acquire new clients. Our businesses are reliant on key employees, and we may face high attrition in our talent. We may not be able to replace displaced talent with new talent on a timely basis or with equivalent skill sets. We are, to a considerable degree, reliant on the continuing leadership of our Chief Executive Officer and would be materially and adversely affected should he unexpectedly cease to be employed by us. In addition, our businesses are subject to fierce competition for talent, which could result in high attrition of our employees, or we may not be able to find the requisite talent to operate our businesses. A significant increase in the attrition rate among employees with specialized skills could decrease our operating efficiency and productivity. Our failure to attract, train and retain personnel with the qualifications necessary to fulfill the needs of our existing and future clients or to assimilate new employees successfully could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, fluctuations in our business may require that we lay off employees with possible negative effects on employee morale. We try to minimize these risks by actively promoting employee relationships and offering competitive salaries, but if we cannot mitigate these risks, our business and our operating performance could be adversely affected. 15 We operate from multiple locations and our employees are very diverse, so we have significant coordination risks. We are headquartered in Ridgefield Park, New Jersey, just outside New York City, and our Agility business is headquartered in Ottawa, Canada. We have six delivery centers in the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka, Germany, and Israel. Our employees are geographically dispersed, as well as culturally diverse. Our personnel need to work together to successfully execute our business plans and we invest in various measures to improve coordination and teamwork. Should we fail in these efforts, our ability to execute our business plans may be adversely affected. Our intellectual property rights are valuable and if we are unable to protect them or are subject to intellectual property rights claims, our business may be harmed. Our intellectual property rights include certain trademarks, trade secrets, domain name registrations, a patent and patent applications. Although we take precautions to protect our intellectual property rights, these efforts may not be sufficient or effective. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, we may experience difficulties in achieving and maintaining brand recognition. Disruptions in telecommunications, system failures, data corruption or virus attacks could harm our ability to execute our global resource model, which could result in client dissatisfaction and a reduction of our revenues. We use a distributed global resource model. Our North American workforce provides services from our U.S. and Canadian offices, as well as from client sites; and our other international workforce provides services from our six offshore delivery centers in the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka, Germany, and Israel. Our global facilities are linked with a telecommunications network that uses multiple service providers. We may not be able to maintain active voice and data communications between our various facilities and our clients' sites at all times due to disruptions in these networks, system failures, data corruption or virus attacks. Any significant failure in our ability to communicate, or the availability of our platforms, could result in a disruption in our business, which could hinder our performance, or our ability to complete client projects on time, or provide services to our clients. This, in turn, could lead to client dissatisfaction and an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Even though we have implemented network security measures, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to computer viruses, cyber-attacks, break-ins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering or intentional and unintentional disclosure of sensitive and /or confidential personal information by employees and non-employees. Additionally, the Company may not be able to effectively identify and resolve such issues on a timely basis. The occurrence of any of the events described above could result in interruptions, delays, the loss or corruption of data, cessations in the availability of systems or liability under privacy laws or contracts, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. 16 Our international operations subject us to risks inherent in doing business on an international level, any of which could increase our costs and hinder our growth. The major part of our operations is carried on in the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka, Israel, Canada and Germany, while our headquarters are in the U.S., and our clients are primarily located in North America and Europe. While we do not depend on significant revenues from sources internal to the Asian countries in which we operate, we are nevertheless subject to certain adverse economic factors relating to overseas economies generally, including inflation, external debt, a negative balance of trade and underemployment. In certain of the countries in which we operate tax authorities have exercised, and may continue to exercise, significant discretionary and arbitrary powers to make tax demands or decline to refund payments that may be due to us as per tax returns. Other risks associated with our international business activities include: One or more of these factors could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Political uncertainty, political unrest, terrorism, and natural calamities in the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka and Israel could adversely affect business conditions in those regions, which in turn could disrupt our business and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. The majority of our delivery centers are located in the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka and Israel. These countries and regions remain vulnerable to disruptions from political uncertainty, political unrest, terrorist acts, and natural calamities. Any damage to our network and/or information systems would damage our ability to provide services, in whole or in part, and/or otherwise damage our operations and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Further, political tensions and escalation of hostilities in any of these countries could adversely affect our operations in these countries and therefore adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. Our global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises. We use a distributed global resource model, which exposes us to risks associated with public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics. A public health crisis in one or more of the geographic areas in which we operate could affect our ability to provide services to our clients and adversely affect our results of operations. 17 The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (“COVID-19”), which the World Health Organization declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020, continues to spread throughout the world. COVID-19 has created significant global economic downturn, disrupted global trade and supply chains, adversely impacted many industries, and contributed to significant declines and volatility in financial markets. In response to COVID-19, countries and local governments have imposed restrictions on the operations of non-essential businesses and services, imposed travel restrictions and implemented societal lockdowns. Additionally, companies are taking precautions, such as requiring employees to work remotely and temporarily closing businesses. All of these factors have had, and are likely to continue to have, a severe adverse effect on global economic conditions, underemployment and unemployment, consumer spending and reductions in non-essential spending by governments and private companies, as well as uncertainty in financial markets. We have experienced limited operational disruptions and declines in customer demand for services to date; however, depending upon the extent and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, we may experience a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition as a result of the effects of COVID-19. In response to the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic we triggered our Business Continuity Plan for our global delivery centers and offices, enabling us to continue operations while safeguarding the health and welfare of our employees. While the pandemic presented, and may in the future present, new risks to our business and there have been logistical and other challenges, there was no material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition by, among others, customers with at-will contracts, particularly in our DDS segment, reducing, delaying or cancelling orders; reduced spending by customers on third-party service providers as part of cost-rationalization efforts or otherwise; or customers determining to bring services in-house and/or customers delaying or postponing data engineering needs. Additionally, the effects of COVID-19 could exacerbate any other risks or uncertainties to which we are subject. Lastly, should we experience material adverse effects on our results of operations or financial condition, we may not be able to access additional sources of liquidity at rates that are acceptable to us, if at all. The situation surrounding COVID-19 crisis remains fluid and the extent and duration of its impact to the economy remains unclear. For this reason, we cannot reasonably estimate with any degree of certainty the future impact to our results of operations and financial condition. The potential for a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition increases the longer the virus affects the level of economic activity in the United States and globally. In the event we experience a significant or prolonged reduction in revenues, the likelihood of which is uncertain, we would seek to manage our liquidity by reducing capital expenditures, deferring investment activities, and reducing operating costs as we would likely have no other source of liquidity to support ongoing operations in a manner that is not significantly detrimental to the business. Terrorist attacks or a war could adversely affect our results of operations. Terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war could affect us or our clients by disrupting normal business practices for extended periods of time and reducing business confidence. In addition, acts of violence or war may make travel more difficult and may effectively curtail our ability to serve our clients' needs, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations. 18 We may face various risks associated with shareholder activists or shareholder demands for better performance . There is no assurance that we will not be subject to shareholder activism or demands. Such activities could interfere with our ability to execute our strategic plan, be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations, and divert the attention of management and our employees. We are the subject of continuing litigation, including litigation by certain of our former employees. In 2008, a judgment was rendered in the Philippines against a Philippine subsidiary of the Company that is no longer active and purportedly also against Innodata Inc., in favor of certain former employees of the Philippine subsidiary. The potential payment amount aggregates to approximately $6.8 million, plus legal interest that accrued at 12% per annum from August 13, 2008 to June 30, 2013, and thereafter accrued and continues to accrue at 6% per annum. The potential payment amount as expressed in U.S. dollars varies with the Philippine peso to U.S. dollar exchange rate. In December 2017, a group of 97 of the former employees of the Philippine subsidiary indicated that they proposed to record the judgment as to themselves in New Jersey. In January 2018, in response to an action initiated by Innodata Inc., the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey (“USDC”) entered a preliminary injunction that enjoins these former employees from pursuing or seeking recognition or enforcement of the judgment against Innodata Inc. in the U.S. during the pendency of the action and until further order of the USDC. In June 2018, the USDC entered a consent order administratively closing the action subject to return of the action to the active docket upon the written request of Innodata Inc. or the former employees, with the USDC retaining jurisdiction over the matter and the preliminary injunction remaining in full force and effect. The principal relevant cases in the Philippines are Court of Appeals Case Nos. CA-G.R. SP No. 93295 Innodata Employees Association (IDEA), Eleanor Tolentino, et al. vs. Innodata Philippines, Inc., et al., and CA-G.R. SP No. 90538 Innodata Philippines, Inc. vs. Honorable Acting Secretary Manuel G. Imson, et al. (28 June 2007), the Department of Labor and Employment National Labor Relations Commission, Republic of the Philippines (NLRC-NCR-Case No.07-04713-2002, et al., Innodata Employees Association (IDEA) and Eleanor A. Tolentino, et al. vs. Innodata Philippines, Inc., et al), and the Department of Labor and Employment Office of the Secretary of Labor and Employment, Republic of the Philippines (Case No. OS-AJ-0015-2001, In Re: Labor Dispute at Innodata Philippines, Inc.). The U.S. District Court action is Civil Action No.: 2:17-cv-13268-SDW-LDW Innodata Inc. v. Myrna C. Augustin-Simon; et al. We are also subject to various other legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. While we believe that we have adequate reserves for those losses that we believe are probable and can be reasonably estimated, the ultimate results of legal proceedings and claims cannot be predicted with certainty. While we currently believe that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or overall trends in our consolidated results of operations, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties. Substantial recovery against us in the above- referenced Philippines action could have a material adverse impact on us, and unfavorable rulings or recoveries in the other proceedings could have a material adverse impact on the consolidated operating results of the period in which the ruling or recovery occurs. In addition, our estimate of potential impact on our consolidated financial position or overall consolidated results of operations for the above referenced legal proceedings could change in the future. See “Legal Proceedings”. Our reputation could be damaged, or our profitability could suffer if we do not meet the controls and procedures in respect of the services and solutions we provide to our clients, or if we contribute to our clients’ internal control deficiencies. Our clients may perform audits or require us to perform audits, provide audit reports or obtain certifications with respect to the controls and procedures that we use in the performance of services for such clients, especially when we process data or information belonging to them. Our ability to acquire new clients and retain existing clients may be adversely affected and our reputation could be harmed if we receive a qualified opinion, or if we cannot obtain an appropriate certification or opinion with respect to our controls and procedures in connection with any such audit in a timely manner. Additionally, our profitability could suffer if our controls and procedures were to fail or to impair our client’s ability to comply with its own internal control requirements. 19 We had a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2020 and cannot assure you that additional material weaknesses will not be identified in the future. Our efforts to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related regulations regarding our required assessment of our internal control over financial reporting requires the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources. We regularly assess the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, remediate any control deficiencies that may be identified, and validate through testing that our controls are functioning as documented. We identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2020 in accounting for capital leases under ASC Topics 840 and 842. We implemented enhancements to our internal controls to prevent and detect such errors from occurring in the future. Our failure to successfully remediate a material weakness could result in adverse consequences to us, including, but not limited to, a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could cause the market price of our stock to decline. Risks Related to Our Contracts A portion of our revenue is generated from projects that we characterize as recurring in nature. Projects that we characterize as recurring are nevertheless subject to termination. Our operating performance is materially dependent on the continuation of these projects. However, we are exposed to the risks that these projects may not be renewed by our clients or they could be terminated by our clients and we may not be able to replace these terminated projects with new recurring projects with similar profitability or clients may ask for a price reduction, which could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations. Our solutions for the Agility segment are sold pursuant to subscription agreements, and if subscription clients elect either not to renew these agreements, or to renew these agreements for less expensive services, our revenues and results of operations will be adversely affected. Our Agility segment derives its revenues primarily from subscription arrangements. Our clients may choose not to renew subscription agreements when they expire or may renew them at lower prices or for a significantly narrower scope of work. If large numbers of existing subscription clients do not renew these agreements or renew these agreements on terms less favorable to us, and if we cannot replace or supplement those non-renewals with new subscription agreements generating the same or greater levels of revenue, our revenues and results of operations will be adversely affected. If our clients are not satisfied with our services, they may terminate our contracts with them or our services and we may suffer reputational damage, which could have an adverse impact on our business. Our business model depends in large part on our ability to attract additional work from our base of existing clients. Our business model also depends on relationships our account teams develop with our clients so that we can understand our clients’ needs and deliver solutions and services that are tailored to those needs. If a client is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us, or with the type of services or solutions delivered, then we could incur additional costs to address the situation, the profitability of that work might be impaired, and the client’s dissatisfaction with our services could damage our ability to obtain additional work from that client. In particular, clients that are not satisfied might seek to terminate existing contracts, which could mean that we could incur costs for the services performed with no associated revenue upon termination of a contract. This could also direct future business to our competitors. In addition, negative publicity related to our client services or relationships, regardless of its accuracy, may further damage our business by affecting our reputation and our ability to compete for new contracts with current and prospective clients. 20 Risks Related to Financial Performance or General Economic Conditions We have no bank facilities or line of credit. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash flows from operations will provide sufficient sources of liquidity to satisfy our financial needs for the next 12 months. However, we have no bank facilities or lines of credit, and reductions in our cash and cash equivalents from operating losses, capital expenditures, adverse legal decisions, acquisitions or other events affecting our access to capital could materially and adversely affect the Company. See “Management Discussion and Analysis – Liquidity and Capital Resources” for additional information. A large portion of our accounts receivable is payable by a limited number of clients; the inability of any of these clients to pay its obligations receivable could adversely affect our results of operations. Several significant clients account for a large percentage of our accounts receivable. If any of these clients were unable, or refused, for any reason, to pay our accounts receivable, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. As of December 31, 2020, 36% or $3.6 million, of our accounts receivable was due from three clients. See “Management Discussion and Analysis – Liquidity and Capital Resources”. In addition, we evaluate the financial condition of our clients prior to extending credit to them. We maintain specific allowances against doubtful receivables. Actual losses on client balances could differ from those that we currently anticipate and, as a result, we might need to adjust our allowances. There is no guarantee that we will accurately assess the creditworthiness of our clients. Macroeconomic conditions could also result in financial difficulties, including limited access to the credit markets, insolvency or bankruptcy, for our clients, and, as a result, could cause clients to delay payments to us, request modifications to their payment arrangements that could increase our receivables balance, or default on their payment obligations to us. If we are unable to timely collect from our clients, our cash flows could be adversely affected. Quarterly fluctuations in our revenues and results of operations could make financial forecasting difficult and could negatively affect our stock price. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, significant fluctuations in our quarterly revenues and results of operations. During the past eight quarters, our net income ranged from income of approximately $1.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 to a loss of approximately $0.7 million in the second quarter of 2019. We experience fluctuations in our revenue and earnings as we replace and begin new projects, which may have some normal start-up delays, or we may be unable to replace a project entirely or on terms that are as attractive to us as the project that is being replaced. These and other factors may contribute to fluctuations in our results of operations from quarter to quarter. A high percentage of our operating expenses, particularly personnel and rent, are relatively fixed in advance of any particular quarter. As a result, unanticipated variations in the number and timing of our projects, or in employee wage levels and utilization rates, may cause us to significantly underutilize our production capacity and employees, resulting in significant variations in our operating results in any particular quarter, and have resulted in losses. 21 The economic environment and pricing pressures could negatively impact our revenues and operating results. Due to the intense competition involved in outsourcing and information technology services, we generally face pricing pressures from our clients due to competition from other companies in our markets. Our ability to maintain or increase pricing is restricted as clients generally expect to receive volume discounts or special pricing incentives as we do more business with them; moreover, our large clients may exercise pressure for discounts outside of agreed terms. Our profitability could suffer if we are not able to maintain pricing on our existing projects and win new projects at appropriate margins. If our pricing structures do not accurately anticipate the cost and complexity of performing our work, then our contracts could be unprofitable. Our profit margin, and therefore our profitability, is dependent on the rates we are able to charge for our services measured against the costs of providing the services. If we are not able to maintain pricing on our existing services and win new projects at profitable margins, or if we underestimate the costs or complexities of new projects and incur losses, our profitability could suffer. The amounts we are able to recover for our services are affected by a number of factors, including competition, volume fluctuations, productivity of employees and processes, the value our client derives from our services and general economic and political conditions. Furthermore, we provide services either on a time-and-materials basis or on a fixed-price basis. Our pricing is highly dependent on our internal forecasts and predictions about our projects, which might be based on limited data and could turn out to be inaccurate. If we do not accurately estimate the costs and timing for completing projects, our contracts could prove unprofitable for us or yield lower profit margins than anticipated. We may not be able to obtain price or volume increases that are necessary to offset the effect of wage inflation and other government mandated cost increases. We have experienced wage inflation and other government mandated cost increases in the Asian countries where we have the majority of our operations. In addition, we may experience adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. These global events have put pressure on our profitability and our margins. Although we have tried to partially offset wage increases, foreign currency fluctuations and other such increases through price increases and improving our efficiency, we cannot ensure that we will be able to continue to do so in the future, which could negatively impact our results of operations. Our international operations subject us to currency exchange fluctuations, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Although most of our revenues are denominated in U.S. dollars, a significant portion of our revenues are denominated in Canadian dollars, Pound Sterling and Euros. In addition, a significant portion of our expenses, primarily labor expenses in the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka, Germany, Canada, the United Kingdom and Israel, are incurred in the local currencies of the countries in which we operate. For financial reporting purposes, we translate all non-U.S. denominated transactions into U.S. dollars in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP). Fluctuations in the value of these currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could have a direct impact on our revenues and our results of operations. The Philippines and India have, at times, experienced high rates of inflation, as well as major fluctuations in the exchange rate between the Philippine peso and the U.S. dollar and the Indian rupee and the U.S. dollar. We are also subject to fluctuations in exchange rates that affect the value of funds held by our foreign subsidiaries. Although we selectively undertake hedging activities to mitigate certain of these risks, our hedging activities may not be effective and may result in losses. See Note 14, “Derivatives,” to the consolidated financial statements. 22 In the event that the governments of India or the Philippines or the government of another country changes its tax policies, rules and regulations, our tax expense may increase and affect our effective tax rates. We are subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. We are subject to the continual examination by tax authorities in India and in the Philippines, and the Company assesses the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits could be materially different from what is reflected in historical income tax and indirect tax provisions and accruals, and could result in a material effect on the Company’s income tax provision, indirect tax expenses, net income or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made. If additional taxes are assessed, it could have an adverse impact on our financial results. In addition, changes in the tax rates, tax laws or the interpretation of tax laws in the jurisdictions where we operate, could affect our future results of operations. In September 2015, the Company’s Indian subsidiary was subject to an inquiry by the Service Tax Department in India regarding the classification of services provided by this subsidiary, asserting that the services provided by this subsidiary fall under the category of online information and database access or retrieval services (“OID Services”), and not under the category of business support services (“BS Services”) that are exempt from service tax as historically indicated in the subsidiary’s service tax filings. Our management disagrees with the Service Tax Department’s position. In November 2019, the Commissioner of Central Tax, GST & Central Excise issued an order confirming the Service Tax Department’s position. The Company is contesting this order in an appeal to the Customs, Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal. In the event the Service Tax Department is ultimately successful in proving that the services fall under the category of OID Services, the revenues earned by the Company’s Indian subsidiary for the period July 2012 through November 2016 would be subject to a service tax of between 12.36% and 15%, and this subsidiary may also be liable to pay interest and penalties. The revenue of our Indian subsidiary during this period was approximately $64.0 million. In accordance with new rules promulgated by the Service Tax Department, as of December 1, 2016 service tax is no longer applicable to OID or BS Services. Based on the assessment of the Company’s counsel, the Company has not recorded any tax liability for this case. In a separate action relating to service tax refunds, in October 2016, the Company’s Indian subsidiary received notices from the Indian Service Tax Department in India seeking to reverse service tax refunds of approximately $160,000 previously granted to our Indian subsidiary for three quarters in 2014, asserting that the services provided by this subsidiary fall under the category of OID Services and not BS Services. The appeal was determined in favor of the Service Tax Department. Management disagrees with the basis of this decision and is contesting it. The Company expects delays in its Indian subsidiary receiving further service tax refunds until this matter is adjudicated with finality, and currently has service tax credits of approximately $1.0 million recorded as a receivable. Based on the assessment of the Company’s counsel, the Company has not recorded any tax liability for this case. Substantial recovery against us in the above referenced 2015 Service Tax Department case could have a material adverse impact on us, and unfavorable rulings or recoveries in other tax proceedings could have a material impact on the consolidated operating results of the period in which the rulings or recovery occurs. If tax authorities in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate contest the manner in which we allocate our profits, our net loss could be higher. A significant portion of the services we provide to our clients are provided by our Asian subsidiaries located in different jurisdictions. Tax authorities in some of these jurisdictions have from time to time challenged the manner in which we allocate our profits among our subsidiaries, and we may not prevail in any future challenge of this type. If such a challenge were successful, our worldwide effective tax rate could increase, thereby decreasing our profitability. 23 An expiration or termination of our preferential tax rate incentives could adversely affect our results of operations. Two of our foreign subsidiaries are subject to preferential tax rates. This tax incentive provides that we pay reduced income taxes with respect to those jurisdictions for a fixed period of time. An expiration or termination of these incentives could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, or increase our tax expense, thereby decreasing our net income and adversely affecting our results of operations. Our earnings may be adversely affected if we change our intent not to repatriate our foreign earnings and profits or if such earnings and profits become subject to U.S. tax on a current basis. A significant portion of our operations are conducted outside the U.S. Despite our access to the overseas earnings and the resulting toll charge, we intend to indefinitely reinvest the foreign earnings in our foreign subsidiaries on account of the foreign jurisdiction withholding tax that the Company has to incur on the actual remittances. Unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries amounted to approximately $47.0 million at December 31, 2020. If such earnings are repatriated in the future, or are no longer deemed to be indefinitely reinvested, the Company would have to accrue as a liability the applicable amount of foreign jurisdiction withholding taxes associated with such remittances. It is unlikely that we will pay dividends. We have not paid any cash dividends since our inception and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We expect that our earnings, if any, will be used to finance our growth. Risks Related to Laws and Regulations Governmental and client focus on data security could increase our costs of operations. In addition, any incident in which we fail to protect our client’s information against security breaches may result in monetary damages against us, and termination of our engagement by our client, and may adversely impact our results of operations. Certain laws and regulations regarding data privacy and security affecting our clients impose requirements regarding the privacy and security of information maintained by these clients, as well as notification to persons whose personal information is accessed by an unauthorized third party. As a result of any continuing legislative initiatives and client demands, we may have to modify our operations with the goal of further improving data security. The cost of compliance with these laws and regulations is high and is likely to increase in the future. Any such modifications may result in increased expenses and operating complexity, and we may be unable to increase the rates we charge for our services sufficiently to offset these increases. In addition, as part of the services we perform, we have access to confidential client data, including sensitive personal data. As a result, we are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect this information. We may also be bound by certain client agreements to use and disclose the confidential client information in a manner consistent with the privacy standards under regulations applicable to such client. Any failure on our part to comply with these laws and regulations can result in negative publicity and diversion of management’s time and effort and may subject us to significant liabilities and other penalties. If client confidential information is inappropriately disclosed due to a breach of our computer systems, system failures or otherwise, or if any person, including any of our employees, negligently disregards or intentionally breaches controls or procedures with which we are responsible for complying with respect to such data or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data, we may have substantial liabilities to our clients. Any incidents with respect to the handling of such information could subject us to litigation or indemnification claims with our clients and other parties. In addition, any breach or alleged breach of our confidentiality agreements with our clients may result in termination of their engagements, resulting in associated loss of revenue and increased costs. 24 Our business is subject to applicable laws and regulations relating to foreign corrupt practices, the violation of which could adversely affect our operations. We must comply with all applicable anti-bribery laws and regulations of the U.S. and other jurisdictions where we operate. For example, we are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010 relating to corrupt and illegal payments to government officials and others . Although we have policies and controls in place that are designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, it is possible that an employee or an agent acting on our behalf could fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, and due to the complex nature of the risks, it may not always be possible for us to ascertain compliance with such laws and regulations. In such event, we could be exposed to civil penalties, criminal penalties and other sanctions, including fines or other unintended punitive actions, and we could incur substantial legal fees and related expenses. In addition, such violations could damage our business and/or our reputation. All of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. Anti-outsourcing legislation, if adopted, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and impair our ability to service our clients. The issue of outsourcing of services abroad by U.S. companies is a topic of political discussion in the U.S. Measures aimed at limiting or restricting outsourcing by U.S. companies are under discussion in Congress and in numerous state legislatures. While no substantive anti-outsourcing legislation has been introduced to date, given the ongoing debate over this issue, the introduction of such legislation is possible. If introduced, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected and our ability to service our clients could be impaired. Our growth could be hindered by visa restrictions. Occasionally, we have employees from our other facilities visit or transfer to the U.S. to meet our clients or work on projects at a client’s site. Any visa restrictions or new legislation putting a restriction on issuing visas could affect our business. Immigration and visa laws and regulations in the U.S. and other countries are subject to legislative and administrative changes, as well as changes in the application of standards. Immigration and visa laws and regulations can be significantly affected by political forces and levels of economic activity. Our international expansion strategy and our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected if legislative or administrative changes to immigration or visa laws and regulations impair our ability to staff projects with our professionals who are not citizens of the country where the work is to be performed. New and changing corporate governance and public disclosure requirements add uncertainty to our compliance policies and increase our costs of compliance. Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to accounting, corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, other SEC regulations, and the Nasdaq Stock Market rules, create uncertainty for companies like ours. These laws, regulations and standards may lack specificity and are subject to varying interpretations. Their application in practice may evolve over time, as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs of compliance as a result of revisions to such corporate governance standards. Although we are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure, and complying with evolving laws, regulations and standards, if we fail to comply with new or changed laws, regulations or standards of corporate governance, our business and reputation may be harmed. 25 Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. None. Item 2. Properties. Our services are primarily performed from our Ridgefield Park, New Jersey headquarters and seven overseas delivery centers in the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka, Canada, Germany, and Israel, all of which are leased. The square footage of all our leased properties totals approximately 236,000. Our leased properties in the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Germany and Israel are primarily used by our DDS segment; our leased property in India is primarily used by our DDS and Synodex segments; and our leased property in Canada is primarily used by our Agility segment. Our leased property in the United States is our corporate headquarters and is used by all segments. In addition, we may need to lease additional property in the future. We believe that we will be able to obtain suitable additional facilities on commercially reasonable terms on an “as needed” basis. Item 3. Legal Proceedings. Reference is made to Note 6, “Commitments and Contingencies - Litigation,” to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report, which is incorporated by reference herein. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures. Not applicable. 26 PART II Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities. Innodata Inc.

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report, which are incorporated by reference herein. In addition to historical information, this discussion includes forward-looking information that involves risks and assumptions based upon management’s current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from the results referred to in any forward-looking statements. See “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” included elsewhere in this report. 27 Correction of Immaterial Errors – During the preparation of the September 30, 2020 condensed consolidated financial statements, certain historical errors were identified relating to the accounting for capital leases under ASC Topics 840 and 842. The lease obligations under certain leases were not recorded at their present values at the inception of the leases; in addition, the asset buyout prices were not reassessed in December 2019 by the Company, both of which resulted in an understatement of expenses from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2019 and an overstatement of expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. The errors were not material, either quantitatively or qualitatively, in any of the reported periods. However, the corrections, if recorded in the three-month period ended September 30, 2020 would have been material to such period. Accordingly, the prior period financial statements were corrected by revising such consolidated financial statements for comparability. For the December 31, 2019 consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K, the corrections are as follows: Executive Overview We are a global data engineering company. We operate in three reporting segments: Digital Data Solutions (DDS), Synodex and Agility. The following table sets forth certain financial data for the two years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019: 28 Results of Operations All percentages have been calculated using rounded amounts. Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2019 Revenues Total revenues were $58.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $2.3 million or 4% from total revenues of $55.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Revenues from the DDS segment were $42.0 million and $41.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, an increase of $0.7 million or approximately 2%. The increase was due to higher volume from one client, partially offset by lower volume from two clients of the DDS segment. Revenues from the Synodex segment were $4.8 million and $3.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, an increase of $0.9 million or approximately 23%. The increase was primarily due to higher volume from three clients, partially offset by lower volume from two clients. Revenues from the Agility segment were $11.4 million and $10.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, an increase of $ 0.7 million or approximately 7%. The increase was attributable to higher revenues from subscriptions to our Agility media database. One client in the DDS segment generated approximately 14% and 16% of the Company’s total revenues in the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Another client in the DDS segment generated 10% of the Company’s total revenues for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. No other client accounted for 10% or more of total revenues during these periods. Further, in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, revenues from non-US clients accounted for 54% and 55% of the Company's revenues respectively. Direct Operating Costs Direct operating costs consist of direct payroll, occupancy costs, data center hosting fees, content acquisition costs, depreciation and amortization, travel, telecommunications, computer services and supplies, realized gain (loss) on forward contracts, foreign currency remeasurement gain (loss), and other direct expenses that are incurred in providing services to our clients. Direct operating costs were $38.4 million and $37.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, an increase of $1.1 million or approximately 3%. This increase was primarily due to an increase in labor related costs of $2.1 million, and technology-related expenditures in connection with our BCP in response to the COVID-19 pandemic of $1.1 million. The increase was offset in part by reductions in occupancy and related costs of $1.1 million, content acquisition costs of $0.2 million, and a decrease of $0.8 million due to reversal of a one-time charge of $0.4 million made in the second quarter of 2019 for an assessment of retroactive foreign social security contributions that was successfully adjudicated. Direct operating costs as percentage of total revenues were 66% and 67% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Direct operating costs for the DDS segment were $28.5 million and $27.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, an increase of $1.0 million or approximately 4%. This increase was primarily due to an increase in labor related costs of $1.8 million, and technology-related expenditures in connection with our BCP in response to the COVID-19 pandemic of $1.1 million. The increase was offset in part by reductions in occupancy and related costs of $1.0 million and a decrease of $0.8 million due to reversal of a one-time charge of $0.4 million made in the second quarter of 2019 for an assessment of retroactive foreign social security contributions that was successfully adjudicated. Direct operating costs for the DDS segment as a percentage of DDS segment revenues were 68% and 67% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 29 Direct operating costs for the Synodex segment were approximately $3.4 million and $3.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, an increase of $0.2 million or 6%. The increase was principally due to labor related costs associated with the increase in volume. Direct operating costs for the Synodex segment as a percentage of segment revenues were 71% and 82% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease in Direct operating costs as a percentage of segment revenues during the year was primarily due to higher revenue. Direct operating costs for the Agility segment were approximately $6.5 million and $6.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, a decrease of $0.1 million or 2%. This decrease was primarily due to a reduction in content acquisition costs. Direct operating costs for the Agility segment as a percentage of Agility segment revenues were 57% and 62% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease in Direct operating costs as a percentage of segment revenues during the year was primarily due to higher revenue from subscriptions to our Agility intelligent data platform and newswire products. Selling and Administrative Expenses Selling and administrative expenses consist of management and administrative salaries, sales and marketing costs including commissions, new services research and related software development, third-party software, advertising and trade conferences, professional fees and consultant costs, and other administrative overhead costs. Selling and administrative expenses were $18.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $19.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $0.8 million or 4%. This decrease was primarily due to lower marketing, travel and occupancy expenses of $0.3 million and professional fees of $0.5 million. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues were 32% and 35% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease in selling and administrative expenses as percentage of revenues during the year was primarily due to higher revenues and lower selling and administrative costs. Selling and administrative expenses for the DDS segment were $12.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $13.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $0.7 million or 5%. This decrease was primarily due to lower marketing, travel and occupancy expenses of $0.2 million and professional fees of $0.5 million. As a percentage of DDS revenues, DDS selling and administrative expenses were 30% and 32% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease in selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues was due to higher revenues and lower selling and administrative expenses. Selling and administrative expenses for the Synodex segment was $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $0.2 million or 29%. This increase was primarily due to labor related expenses. Selling and administrative expenses for the Synodex segment as a percentage of Synodex segment revenues were 19% and 18% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Selling and administrative expenses for the Agility segment were $5.4 million and $5.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, a decrease of $0.3 million or 5%. This decrease was primarily due to labor related expenses. Selling and administrative expenses for the Agility segment as a percentage of Agility segment revenues were 47% and 53% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease in selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues was due to higher revenues and lower selling and administrative expenses. 30 Goodwill Impairment On March 31, 2020, we determined that adverse changes in macroeconomic trends as a consequence of the continuing COVID-19 pandemic constituted a triggering event under the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (the “FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) No. 350, “Intangibles - Goodwill and Other” and ASC No. 360, “Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets”). We completed our impairment analysis procedures as of March 31, 2020. We determined that there was no impairment of long-lived assets in any of the reporting units as of March 31, 2020. On September 30, 2020, w e performed our annual goodwill assessment for the Agility segment in accordance with the provisions of the FASB’s Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2017-04, “Intangibles – Goodwill and Other (Topic 350)”, by using a single step approach that evaluates the carrying value of goodwill and comparing it against the reporting unit’s fair value . Our conclusion was consistent with the results of the March 31, 2020 impairment test. Income Taxes We recorded a provision for income taxes of approximately $0.4 million and $1.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Tax-related charges primarily consisted of a provision for foreign taxes recorded in accordance with the local tax regulations by our foreign subsidiaries. Effective income tax rates are disproportionate primarily due to the valuation allowance recorded on the deferred taxes on the U.S. and Canadian entities. See Note 4, “Income Taxes” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. The reconciliation of the U.S. statutory rate with the Company’s effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are summarized in the table below: Despite access to overseas earnings and the resulting toll charge, we intend to indefinitely reinvest earnings and profits in our foreign subsidiaries on account of the foreign jurisdiction withholding taxes that we would have to incur on the actual remittances. Unremitted foreign earnings and profits amounted to approximately $47.0 million at December 31, 2020. If such foreign earnings and profits are repatriated in the future, or are no longer deemed to be indefinitely reinvested, we would have to accrue the applicable amount of foreign jurisdiction withholding taxes associated with such remittances. 31 We have a valuation allowance on all of our U.S. deferred tax assets on account of continuing losses incurred by our U.S. entity. In addition, we also have a valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets of our Canadian subsidiaries. Our Canadian subsidiaries also have research and development credits available to reduce taxable income in future years, which may be carried forward indefinitely. The potential benefits from these balances have not been recognized for financial statement purposes. Tax Assessments In September 2015, our Indian subsidiary was subject to an inquiry by the Service Tax Department in India regarding the classification of services provided by this subsidiary, asserting that the services provided by this subsidiary fall under the category of online information and database access or retrieval services (OID Services), and not under the category of business support services (BS Services) that are exempt from service tax as historically indicated in the subsidiary’s service tax filings. We disagree with the Service Tax Department’s position. In November 2019, the Commissioner of Central Tax, GST & Central Excise issued an order confirming the Service Tax Department’s position. We are vigorously contesting this order in an appeal to the Customs, Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal . In the event the Service Tax Department is ultimately successful in proving that the services fall under the category of OID Services, the revenues earned by our Indian subsidiary for the period July 2012 through November 2016 would be subject to a service tax of between 12.36% and 15%, and this subsidiary may also be liable to pay interest and penalties . The revenue of our Indian subsidiary during this period was approximately $64.0 million. In accordance with new rules promulgated by the Service Tax Department, as of December 1, 2016 service tax is no longer applicable to OID or BS Services. Based on our counsel’s assessment, we have not recorded any tax liability for this case. In a separate action relating to service tax refunds, in October 2016, our Indian subsidiary received notices from the Indian Service Tax Department in India seeking to reverse service tax refunds of approximately $160,000 previously granted to our Indian subsidiary for three quarters in 2014, asserting that the services provided by this subsidiary fall under the category of OID Services and not BS Services. The appeal was determined in favor of the Service Tax Department. We disagree with the basis of this decision and are contesting it vigorously. We expect delays in our Indian subsidiary receiving further service tax refunds until this matter is adjudicated with finality, and currently have service tax credits of approximately $1.0 million recorded as a receivable. Based on our counsel’s assessment, we have not recorded any tax liability for this case. Net Income (Loss) We had a net income of $0.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to a net loss of $2.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. The $2.7 million improvement was attributable to higher revenues of $2.3 million, and a decrease in tax provision of $0.7 million, partially offset by higher operating expenses of $0.3 million. Net income for the DDS segment was $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to a net loss of $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The $0.8 million improvement was attributable to higher revenues of $0.7 million and a decrease in tax provisions of $0.4 million, partially offset by higher operating expenses of $0.3 million. Net income for the Synodex segment was $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to breakeven for the year ended December 31, 2019. The $0.5 million increase was primarily attributable to the higher revenues of $0.9 million offset in part by higher operating expenses of $0.4 million. Net loss for the Agility segment was $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to a net loss of $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The $1.4 million improvement was the result of higher revenues of $0.7 million, reductions in operating expenses of $0.4 million and a tax benefit of $0.3 million. 32 Liquidity and Capital Resources Selected measures of liquidity and capital resources, expressed in thousands, are as follows: On December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $17.6 million, of which $10.2 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries, and $7.4 million was held in the United States. Despite the passage of the new tax law under which we may repatriate funds from overseas after paying the toll charge, it is our intent, as of December 31, 2020, to permanently reinvest the overseas funds in our foreign subsidiaries on account of the withholding tax that we would have to incur on the actual remittances. We have used, and plan to use, our cash and cash equivalents for (i) investments in the Agility segment; (ii) the expansion of our other operations; (iii) technology innovation; (iv) product management and strategic marketing; (v) general corporate purposes, including working capital; and (vi) possible business acquisitions. As of December 31, 2020, we had working capital of approximately $13.5 million, as compared to working capital of approximately $8.3 million as of December 31, 2019. On May 4, 2020, we received loan proceeds of $579,700 under the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), which was established as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act. The loans and accrued interest are forgivable, as long as the borrower uses the loan proceeds for eligible purposes, including payroll, benefits, rent and utilities, and maintains its payroll levels. The unforgiven portion of the loan is payable over two years at an interest rate of 1% per year, with a deferral of payments until the date that the Small Business Administration remits the borrower’s loan forgiveness amount to the lender. On January 29, 2021, we filed our loan forgiveness application for 100% of the approved loan under the PPP. Proceeds from stock option exercises for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $2.6 million. We did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures as of December 31, 2020. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash flows from operations will provide sufficient sources of liquidity to satisfy our financial needs for the next 12 months from the date of issuance of these financial statements. However, as we have no bank facilities or lines of credit, reductions in our cash and cash equivalents from operating losses, capital expenditures, adverse legal decisions, acquisitions or otherwise could materially and adversely affect the Company. Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Cash provided by our operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $5.7 million and was the result of the net income of $0.6 million, the effect of adjustments for non-cash items of $3.4 million and sources of working capital of $1.6 million. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of $2.3 million for depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation of $0.9 million and $0.2 million for other non-cash items. Working capital activities primarily consisted of sources from a $1.4 million increase in accrued salaries, wages and related benefits, a $0.8 million increase in income and other taxes, offset by a $0.6 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets. Refer to the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for further details. 33 Cash provided by our operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $4.3 million and was the result of the net loss of $2.1 million, the effect of adjustments for non-cash items of $3.6 million and sources of working capital of $2.9 million. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of $2.7 million for depreciation and amortization, stock option expense of $0.8 million and $0.1 million for other non-cash items. Working capital activities primarily consisted of sources from a $1.2 million decrease in our accounts receivable, a $1.2 million decrease in prepaid and other current assets, and a $0.9 million increase in income and other taxes which was offset in part by a use of $0.5 million due to an increase in other working capital. The reduction in accounts receivable is a result of higher collections during the year ended December 31, 2019. Refer to the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for further details. Our days’ sales outstanding were 62 days and 66 days December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We calculate DSO by first dividing the total revenues for the period by average net accounts receivable, which is the sum of net accounts receivable at the beginning of the period and net accounts receivable at the end of the period, to yield an amount we refer to as the “accounts receivable turnover”. Then we divide the total number of days within the period reported by the accounts receivable turnover to yield DSO expressed in number of days. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities Cash used in our investing activities was $1.4 million and $1.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These capital expenditures were principally for the purchase of technology equipment including servers, network infrastructure and workstations, and expenditures for internally developed software. Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2020 amounting to $1.4 million consisted of $0.6 million for the DDS segment and $0.8 million for the Agility segment. For the year 2020, we anticipate that capital expenditures for ongoing technology, equipment and infrastructure upgrades will approximate $2.0 to $2.3 million, a portion of which we may finance. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was from PPP loan proceeds of $0.6 million and proceeds from stock option exercises of $2.6 million. Payments of long-term obligations were $0.9 million and $0.6 million for December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Cash used in financing activities for 2019 was $1.8 million for the repurchase of 1,503,095 shares of our common stock at a volume-weighted average price of $1.23 per share. Inflation, Seasonality and Prevailing Economic Conditions Although most of our revenues are denominated in U.S. dollars, a significant portion of our revenues is denominated in Canadian dollars, Pound Sterling and Euros. In addition, a significant portion of our expenses, primarily labor expenses in the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka, Germany, Canada and Israel, are incurred in the local currencies of the countries in which we operate. For financial reporting purposes, we translate all non-U.S. denominated transactions into U.S. dollars in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Thus, we are exposed to the risk that fluctuations in the value of these currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could have a direct impact on our revenues and our results of operations. The Philippines and India have at times experienced high rates of inflation as well as major fluctuations in the exchange rate between the Philippine peso and the U.S. dollar and the Indian rupee and the U.S. dollar. As of December 31, 2020, the aggregate notional amount of our hedges against the Indian rupee was approximately $2.9 million , and $4.0 million for the Philippine peso . 34 Fluctuations in exchange rates also affect the value of funds held by our foreign subsidiaries. We do not currently intend to hedge these assets. Our most significant costs are the salaries and related benefits of our employees in Asia. We are exposed to high inflation in wage rates in the countries in which we operate. We generally perform work for our clients under project-specific contracts, requirements-based contracts or long-term contracts. We must adequately anticipate wage increases, particularly on our fixed-price contracts. There can be no assurance that we will be able to recover cost increases through increases in the prices that we charge for our services to our clients. Our quarterly operating results are subject to certain fluctuations. We experience fluctuations in our revenue and earnings as we replace and begin new projects, which may have some normal start-up delays, or we may be unable to replace a project entirely. These and other factors may contribute to fluctuations in our operating results from quarter to quarter. In addition, as some of our Asian facilities are closed during holidays in the fourth quarter, we typically incur higher wages, due to overtime, that reduce our margins. Our Synodex subsidiary experiences seasonal fluctuations in revenues. Typically, revenue is lowest in the third quarter of the calendar year and highest in the fourth quarter of the calendar year. The seasonality is directly linked to the number of life insurance applications received by the insurance companies. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Under the supervision, and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), as of December 31, 2020. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2020, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 35 Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and disposition of assets; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of company assets are made in accordance with management and director authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected. Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) - issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2020. A material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company’s annual or interim financial information will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. This Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management’s report was not subject to attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only management’s report in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the three months ended December 31, 2020 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. These changes relate to remediation of the material weakness on appropriate review procedures related to evaluation and proper accounting for lease contracts consistent with capital lease accounting under U.S. GAAP. The Company implemented enhancements to its internal controls to prevent and detect errors by instituting additional controls and procedures that entails a comprehensive review of new lease contracts to ensure that all appropriate clauses are thoroughly evaluated and accounted for in accordance with ASC 842 guidance.

AND SUBSIDIARIES INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS F- 1 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Shareholders and Board of Directors Innodata Inc. Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Innodata Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2020, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Revision to 2019 consolidated financial statements. We have also audited the revision adjustments to 2019 consolidated financial statements to correct the immaterial errors as discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, such revision adjustments are appropriate and have been properly applied. We were not engaged to audit, review, or apply any procedures to the 2019 consolidated financial statements of the Company other than with respect to the revision adjustments and, accordingly, we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on the 2019 consolidated financial statements taken as a whole. Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. F- 2 Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Description of Matter: As described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s Intangible assets and goodwill balance was $ 6.8 million as of December 31, 2020. Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level and more frequently when an event occurs, or circumstances change, that indicates the carrying value may not be recoverable. The determination of the fair value of the reporting unit requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasts of future revenues and operating margins and discount rates which are complex and subjective. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the fair value. We identified the intangible assets, including goodwill, impairment assessment of the Agility Segment Reporting Unit as a critical audit matter considering materiality of the amounts involved together with the inherent subjectivity related to principal assumptions, which are dependent on current and future economic factors including uncertainties arising from corona virus disease 2019 (“COVID-19”) pandemic; hence assessment of carrying values of intangible asset including goodwill for these unit is considered to be complex and determined to be a critical audit matter in our current period audit. Auditing management’s judgments regarding forecasts of future revenue, operating margin, and the discount rate to be applied, involved a high degree of subjectivity. How the matter was addressed in our audit: The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included: F- 3 Description of Matter The Company operates in various countries and is subject to income taxes in multiple tax jurisdictions, with complexities of transfer pricing and changing tax laws, and is involved in various tax cases with respective tax authorities. Uncertainties arise primarily from certain ongoing tax litigations and open tax years for its foreign subsidiaries. As described in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has recognized accruals with respect of uncertain tax positions aggregating $ 3.2 million as of December 31, 2020. We identified measurement of accruals for the aforementioned income tax exposures as a critical audit matter, as the amounts involved are material, and the determination of provision for taxes requires the Company to make judgments on tax issues and develop estimates regarding the Company’s exposure to tax risks. Further, auditing management judgments on whether the tax positions are probable of being sustained in tax assessments involves a high degree of subjectivity. How the matter was addressed in our audit: The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included: /s/ BDO INDIA LLP We have served as the Company's auditor since 2020. Mumbai, India March 11, 2021 F- 4 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Stockholders Innodata Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited, before the effects of the adjustments for the correction of the errors described in Note 1 (Correction of Immaterial Errors), the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Innodata Inc. and Subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2019, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, except for the errors described in Note 1 (Correction of Immaterial Errors), the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019, and its results of operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We were not engaged to audit, review, or apply any procedures to the adjustments for the correction of the errors described in Note 1(Correction of Immaterial Errors), and, accordingly, we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance about whether such adjustments are appropriate and have been properly applied. Those adjustments were audited by BDO India LLP. (The 2019 consolidated financial statements before the effects of the adjustments discussed in Note 1 are not presented herein).

Moreover, as AI projects become more specialized and mission-critical, data preparation is becoming increasingly complex, requiring deep domain knowledge and an infrastructure in which data security is assured. The Company utilize a variety of leading third-party image and video annotation tools. For text, the Company use its proprietary text annotation platform that incorporates AI to reduce cost while improving consistency and quality of output. The Company’s proprietary text annotation platform features auto-tagging capabilities that apply to both classical and generative AI tasks. It also encapsulates many of the innovations the Company has conceived of in the course of its 30-year history of creating high-quality data. F- 10 INNODATA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AI/ML Solutions The Company also provides AI/ML solutions to companies that intensively process textual data and seek to obtain the benefits of AI/ML technologies without having to develop AI/ML engineering capabilities in-house. For such companies, the Company often integrates one or more of its pre-trained text processing algorithms as a foundation for an overall solution. The Company’s algorithms are accessible as microservices via application programming interfaces (APIs), enabling easy integration. In conjunction with AI/ML solutions, the Company often provides a range of data engineering support services, including data transformation, data curation, data hygiene, data consolidation, data compliance, and master data management. The Company’s customers span a diverse range of industries and a wide range of AI use cases, benefiting from the short time-to-value and high economic returns the Company’s AI/ML solutions provide. AI/ML Industry Platforms The Company’s industry platforms address specific, niche market requirements that the Company believes it can fulfill in large part with its AI/ML technologies. The Company deploys these industry platforms as software-as-a-service (SaaS) and as managed services. To date, the Company has built an industry platform for medical records data extraction and transformation (which the Company brands as “Synodex ® ”) and for marketing communications/public relations news distribution and monitoring (which the Company brands as “Agility PR Solutions”). The Company’s Synodex industry platform transforms medical records into useable digital data organized in accordance with its proprietary data models or client data models. At the end of 2020, the Company had 20 clients utilizing its Synodex platform, including John Hancock Insurance, the insurance operating unit of John Hancock Financial (a division of Manulife) and one of the largest life insurers in the United States. The Company’s Agility industry platform provides marketing communications and public relations professionals with the ability to target and distribute content to journalists and social media influencers world-wide and to monitor and analyze global news (print, web, radio and TV) and social media. Principles of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Innodata Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, and the Synodex and docGenix limited liability companies that are majority-owned by the Company. The non-controlling interests in the Synodex and docGenix limited liability companies are accounted for in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) non-controlling interest guidance. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. F- 11 INNODATA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Use of Estimates - In preparing consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management believes that the estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are reasonable, and management has made assumptions about the possible effects of the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic on critical and significant accounting estimates. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include those related to the allowance for doubtful accounts and billing adjustments, useful life of long-lived assets, useful life of intangible assets, impairment of goodwill, valuation of deferred tax assets, valuation of stock-based compensation, litigation accruals and estimated accruals for various tax exposures. Revenue Recognition - The Company’s revenue is recognized when services are rendered or goods are delivered to a customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for those services or goods as per the agreement with the customer. In cases where there are agreements with multiple performance obligations, the Company identifies each performance obligation and evaluates whether the performance obligations are distinct within the context of the agreement at the agreement’s inception. Performance obligations that are not distinct at agreement inception are combined. For agreements with distinct performance obligation, the Company allocates the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation proportionately based on the estimated standalone selling price for each performance obligation, if any, and then evaluates how the services are performed for the customer to determine the timing of revenue recognition. For the Digital Data Solutions (DDS) segment, revenue is recognized primarily based on the quantity delivered or resources utilized in the period in which services are performed and performance conditions are satisfied as per the agreement. Revenues for agreements billed on a time-and-materials basis are recognized as services are performed. Revenues under fixed-fee agreements, which are not significant to overall revenues, are recognized based on the proportional performance method of accounting, as services are performed, or milestones are achieved. For the Synodex segment, revenue is recognized primarily based on the quantity delivered in the period in which services are performed and performance conditions are satisfied as per the agreement. A portion of the Synodex segment revenue is derived from licensing our functional software and providing access to the Company’s hosted software platform. Revenue from such services is recognized monthly when all parties to the agreement have agreed to the agreement; each party’s rights are identifiable; the payment terms are identifiable; the agreement has commercial substance; access to the service is provided to the end user; and collection is probable. The Agility segment derives its revenue primarily from subscription arrangements and provision of enriched media analysis services. It also derives revenue as a reseller of corporate communication solutions. Revenue from subscriptions is recognized monthly when access to the service is provided to the end user; all parties to the agreement have agreed to the agreement; each party’s rights are identifiable; the payment terms are identifiable; the agreement has commercial substance; and collection is probable. Revenue from enriched media analysis services is recognized when the services are performed, and performance conditions are satisfied. Revenues from the reseller agreements are recognized at the gross amount received for the goods in accordance with our functioning as a principal due to our meeting the following criteria: the Company acts as the primary obligor in the sales transaction; assumes the credit risk; sets the price; can select suppliers; and is involved in the execution of the services, including after sales service. Revenues include reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses, with the corresponding out-of-pocket expenses included in direct operating costs. F- 12 INNODATA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Company considers U.S. GAAP criteria for determining whether to report gross revenue as a principal versus net revenue as an agent. The Company evaluates whether it is in control of the services before the same are transferred to the customer to assess whether it is principal or agent in the arrangement. Revenues are recognized on a gross basis if the Company is in the capacity of principal and on a net basis if it falls in the capacity of an agent. Contract acquisition costs, which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets are amortized over the term of a subscription agreement or contract that normally has a duration of 12 months or less. The Company reviews these prepaid acquisition costs on a periodic basis to determine the need to adjust the carrying values for early terminated contracts. Foreign Currency Translation - The functional currency of our locations in the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka, Israel and Hong Kong is the U.S. dollar. Transactions denominated in Philippine pesos, Indian and Sri Lankan rupees, Israeli shekels and Hong Kong dollars are translated to U.S. dollars at rates which approximate those in effect on the transaction dates. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at December 31, 2020 and 2019 are translated at the exchange rate in effect as of those dates. Nonmonetary assets, liabilities, and stockholders’ equity are translated at the appropriate historical rates. Included in direct operating costs were exchange losses resulting from such transactions of approximately $108,000 and $158,000 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The functional currency for the Company’s subsidiaries in Germany, the United Kingdom and Canada are the Euro, the Pound Sterling and the Canadian dollar, respectively. The financial statements of these subsidiaries are prepared in these respective currencies. Financial information is translated from the applicable functional currency to the U.S. dollar (the reporting currency) for inclusion in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Income, expenses and cash flows are translated at weighted average exchange rates prevailing during the fiscal period, and assets and liabilities are translated at fiscal period-end exchange rates. Resulting translation adjustments are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders' equity. Foreign exchange transaction gains or losses are included in direct operating costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). The amount of foreign currency translation adjustment was $406,000 and $566,000 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Derivative Instruments - The Company accounts for derivative transactions in accordance with ASC 825, “Financial Instruments,” with the corresponding unrealized gain or loss recognized outright as part of operating income. The total notional value of outstanding foreign currency forward contracts at December 31, 2020 was $6.9 million. Cash Equivalents - For financial statement purposes, the Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Property and Equipment - Property and equipment are stated at cost and are depreciated on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which is generally two to ten years. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the terms of the leases. Certain assets under capital leases are amortized over the lives of the respective leases or the estimated useful lives of the assets, whichever is shorter. Capitalized Software Development Costs - the Company incurs development costs related to its internal use software. Qualifying costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized. These costs primarily consist of internal labor and third-party development costs and are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, which is generally ranges between three and nine years. All other research and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Capitalized software and development costs – in progress as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $1.4 million and $2.5 million respectively. Completed capitalized software and development cost as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $10.7 million and $8.1 million respectively. F- 13 INNODATA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Long-lived Assets - Management assesses the recoverability of its long-lived assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The following factors, if present, may trigger an impairment review: (i) significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results; (ii) significant negative industry or economic trends; (iii) significant decline in the Company’s stock price for a sustained period; and (iv) a change in the Company’s market capitalization relative to net book value. If the recoverability of these assets is unlikely because of the existence of one or more of the above-mentioned factors, an impairment analysis is performed, using undiscounted cash flow projections. Management makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of these respective assets. An impairment loss will be recognized only if the carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value, and is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair value. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets – The Company performs a valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed on each acquisition accounted for as a business combination and allocates the purchase price of each acquired business to its respective net tangible and intangible assets and liabilities. Acquired intangible assets principally consist of technology, client relationships, backlog and trademarks. Liabilities related to intangibles principally consist of unfavorable vendor contracts. The Company determines the appropriate useful life by performing an analysis of expected cash flows based on projected financial information of the acquired businesses. Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method, which approximates the pattern in which the majority of the economic benefits are expected to be consumed. Intangible assets are amortized into direct operating costs ratably over their expected related revenue streams over their useful lives. Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the fair value of the acquired net assets. The Company does not amortize goodwill but evaluates it for impairment at the reporting unit level annually during the third quarter of each fiscal year (as of September 30 of that year) or when an event occurs, or circumstances change, that indicates the carrying value may not be recoverable. The Company performed its annual goodwill assessment for the Agility segment as of September 30, 2020. In performing the assessment, the Company adhered to the provisions of ASU 2017-04 by using a single step approach that determines the carrying value of goodwill and comparing it against the excess of the reporting unit’s fair value. Based on the Company’s assessment, the Company reached the conclusion that there was no goodwill impairment because the fair value of the Agility segment’s goodwill exceeded its carrying value. Income Taxes - Estimated deferred taxes are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates, as well as any net operating loss or tax credit carryforwards expected to reduce taxes payable in future years. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the estimated deferred tax assets will not be realized. While the Company considers future taxable income in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event that the Company anticipates that it will be able to realize the estimated deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount, an adjustment to the provision for deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made. Similarly, in the event that the Company anticipates that it will not be able to realize the estimated deferred tax assets in the future considering future taxable income, an adjustment to the provision for deferred tax assets would decrease income in the period such determination was made. Changes in the valuation allowance from period to period are included in the Company’s tax provision in the period of change. The Company indefinitely reinvests the foreign earnings in its foreign subsidiaries. If such earnings are repatriated in the future, or are no longer deemed to be indefinitely reinvested, the Company would have to accrue as a liability the applicable amount of foreign jurisdiction withholding taxes associated with such remittances. F- 14 INNODATA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considered whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the U.S. and Canadian deferred tax assets will not be realizable. As the expectation of future taxable income resulting from the Synodex and Agility segments cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company maintains a valuation allowance against all the U.S. and Canadian net deferred tax assets. The Company accounts for income taxes regarding uncertain tax positions, and recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Accounting for Leases - In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842),” as modified (“ASU 2016-02”), which replaced existing leasing rules with a comprehensive lease measurement and recognition standard and expanded disclosure requirements. ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets as liabilities, with corresponding “right-of-use” assets and is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, subject to early adoption. The Company adopted ASU 2016-02 effective January 1, 2019. Upon adoption, the Company recognized a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability. See Note 6, Operating Leases. The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at the inception date and requires an assessment of whether the fulfillment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets or the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset. A reassessment is made after inception of the lease only if one of the following applies: Whenever a reassessment is made, lease accounting shall commence or cease from the date when the change in circumstances gave rise to the reassessment for scenarios (a), (c) or (d) and at the date of renewal or extension period for scenario (b). Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as operating leases. As of December 31, 2020, all of the Company’s leases are classified under operating leases. Operating lease payments are recognized as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - The Company measures and recognizes stock-based compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors based on the estimated fair value at the grant date. The stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period. The fair value is determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. F- 15 INNODATA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The stock-based compensation expense related to the Company’s stock plans were allocated as follows (in thousands): Fair Value of Financial Instruments - The carrying amounts of financial instruments approximated their fair value as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, because of the relative short maturity of these instruments. See Note 14, Financial Instruments. Fair value measurements and disclosures define fair value as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The accounting standard establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels. The three levels are defined as follows: The Company’s forward contracts are at level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Accounts Receivable - The Company establishes credit terms for new clients based upon management’s review of their credit information and project terms, and performs ongoing credit evaluations of its clients, adjusting credit terms when management believes appropriate based upon payment history and an assessment of the client’s current creditworthiness. The Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its clients to make required payments. The Company determines its allowance by considering a number of factors, including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due (accounts outstanding longer than the payment terms are considered past due), the Company’s previous loss history, the client’s current ability to pay its obligation to the Company, and the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole. This cannot guarantee that credit loss rates in the future will not be greater than those experienced in the past. In addition, there is credit exposure if the financial condition of one of the Company’s major clients were to deteriorate. In the event that the financial condition of one of the Company’s clients were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be necessary. The allowance for doubtful accounts as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 was approximately $0.7 million and $0.8 million, respectively. Total amounts written off against the existing allowance for doubtful accounts for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $0.3 million. Concentration of Credit Risk - The Company maintains its cash with highly rated financial institutions, located in the United States and in foreign locations where the Company has its operations. At December 31, 2020, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $17.6 million, of which $10.2 million was held by its foreign subsidiaries with local banks located mainly in Asia and $7.4 million was held in the United States. To the extent that such cash exceeds the maximum insurance levels, the Company is uninsured. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts. F- 16 INNODATA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Income (Loss) per Share – Income (loss) per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted income (loss) per share is computed by considering the impact of the potential issuance of common shares, using the treasury stock method, on the weighted average number of shares outstanding. For those securities that are not convertible into a class of common stock, the “two class” method of computing income (loss) per share is used. Pension - The Company records annual pension costs based on calculations, which include various actuarial assumptions including discount rates, compensation increases and other assumptions involving demographic factors. The Company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends. The Company believes that the assumptions used in recording its pension obligations are reasonable based on its experience, market conditions and inputs from its actuaries. Deferred Revenue - Deferred revenue represents payments received from clients in advance of providing services and amounts deferred if conditions for revenue recognition have not been met. Included in accrued expenses on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets is deferred revenue amounting to $1.2 million and $1.1 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Recent Accounting Pronouncements – In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes” as part of its initiative to reduce complexity in the accounting standards. The standard eliminates certain exceptions related to the approach for intra-period tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. The standard also clarifies and simplifies other aspects of the accounting for income taxes. The standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020. Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect that the adoption of the new guidance will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-14, “Compensation-Retirement Benefits-Defined Benefit Plans-General (Subtopic 715-20): Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans” (“ASU 2018-14”), which makes minor changes to the disclosure requirements for employers that sponsor defined benefit pension and/or other postretirement benefit plans. The guidance eliminates requirements for certain disclosures that are no longer considered cost beneficial and adds new disclosure requirements that the FASB considers pertinent. ASU 2018-14 is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2020 for public entities. The Company adopted the standard and it had no material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, “Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Statements” (“ASU 2016-13”). ASU 2016-13 requires a financial asset (or a group of financial assets) measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation amount that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset(s) to present the net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected on the financial asset. In November 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-19, “Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses,” which clarifies codification and corrects unintended application of the guidance, and in November 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-11, “Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses,” which clarifies or addresses specific issues about certain aspects of ASU 2016-13. In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-03, “Codification Improvements to Financial Instruments,” which modifies the measurement of expected credit losses of certain financial instruments. ASU 2016-13 is effective for certain Smaller Reporting Companies for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022 and interim periods within those fiscal years, which will be fiscal 2023 for us if we continue to be classified as a Smaller Reporting Company, with early adoption permitted. F- 17 INNODATA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS We do not expect that the adoption of the new guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Correction of Immaterial Errors – During the preparation of the September 30, 2020 condensed consolidated financial statements, certain historical errors were identified relating to the accounting for capital leases under ASC Topics 840 and 842. The lease obligations under certain leases were not recorded at their present values at the inception of the leases; in addition, the asset buyout prices were not reassessed in December 2019 by the Company, both of which resulted in an understatement of expenses from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2019 and an overstatement of expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. The errors were not material, either quantitatively or qualitatively, in any of the reported periods. However, the corrections, if recorded in the three-month period ended September 30, 2020 would have been material to such period. Accordingly, the prior period financial statements were corrected by revising such consolidated financial statements for comparability. For the December 31, 2019 consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K, the corrections are as follows: The Company evaluated each year’s/period’s errors under Staff Accounting Bulletins 99 and 108 and concluded that a restatement of year’s/prior periods’ consolidated financial statements is not required. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements for prior periods (March 31, 2020 and June 30, 2020) will be revised in future Forms 10-Q to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Reclassifications – Certain information presented in the 2019 supplemental disclosures of cash flow information has been revised to conform to the 2020 presentation. Property and equipment, which include amounts recorded under capital leases, are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization (in thousands), and consist of the following: F- 18 INNODATA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Included in the property and equipment was capitalized software development cost - in progress. The estimated useful lives of the property and equipment ranges between two years and ten years. Depreciation and amortization expense of property and equipment excluding capitalized software development cost - in progress were approximately $1.4 million and $1.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows (in thousands): The Company determined that adverse changes in macroeconomic trends as a consequence of the continuing COVID-19 pandemic constituted a triggering event under U.S. GAAP (Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) No. 350, “Intangibles - Goodwill and Other” and ASC No. 360, “Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets”). The Company completed its impairment analysis procedures as of March 31, 2020. The Company determined that there was no impairment of long-lived assets in any of the reporting units as of March 31, 2020. On September 30, 2020, The Company performed its annual goodwill assessment for the Agility segment in accordance with the provisions of ASU 2017-04, by using a single-step approach that determines the carrying value of goodwill and compares it against the reporting unit’s fair value . The Company’s conclusion was consistent with the results of the March 31, 2020 impairment test. The fair value measurement of goodwill for the Agility segment was classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy because the Company used the income approach, which utilizes significant inputs that are unobservable in the market and the market multiple approach using comparable entities to further validate the carrying values. The Company believes it made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of the reporting unit as of the impairment test measurement date. The carrying value of Goodwill was $2,150,000 and $2,108,000 as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. F- 19 INNODATA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Information regarding our acquisition-related intangible assets is as follows for the dates indicated (in thousands): Amortization expense relating to acquisition-related intangible assets was approximately $0.9 million and $1.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Estimated annual amortization expense for intangible assets subsequent to December 31, 2020 is as follows (in thousands): F- 20 INNODATA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The significant components of the provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows (in thousands): The reconciliation of the U.S. statutory rate with the Company’s effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 is summarized as follows: F- 21 INNODATA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current. Significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows (in thousands): In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realizable. The ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences are deductible and net operating losses are available. As of December 31, 2020, the Company continues to maintain a valuation allowance on all U.S. and Canadian net deferred tax assets. The Company maintained a valuation allowance of approximately $7.9 million and $6.5 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The valuation allowance relates to U.S. and the Company’s Canadian subsidiaries deferred tax assets. The net change in the total valuation allowance was an increase of $1.4 million and $1.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Despite the access to the overseas earnings and the resulting toll charge, we intend to indefinitely reinvest the foreign earnings in our foreign subsidiaries on account of the foreign jurisdiction withholding tax that the Company has to incur on the actual remittances. Unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries amounted to approximately $47.0 million at December 31, 2020. If such earnings are repatriated in the future, or are no longer deemed to be indefinitely reinvested, the Company would have to accrue the applicable amount of foreign jurisdiction withholding taxes associated with such remittances. F- 22 INNODATA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS United States and foreign components of income (loss) before provision for income taxes for each of the two years ended December 31, were as follows (in thousands): At December 31, 2020, the Company had available U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $15.5 million. These net operating loss carryforwards expire at various times through the year 2035. On March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was signed into law in response to the economic challenges facing US businesses. Under the CARES Act, the Internal Revenue Code was amended to allow for federal NOL carrybacks for five years to offset previous years income or can be carryforward indefinitely to offset 100% of taxable income for the tax year 2020 and 80% of taxable income for tax years 2021 and thereafter. As of the date the financial statements were available to be issued, the state NOL carryforwards, if not utilized, will expire beginning in 2022. At December 31, 2020, the Company’s Canadian subsidiaries had available net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $16.1 million in Canada which begin to expire in 2028. The potential benefits from these balances have not been recognized for financial statement purposes. The Company had unrecognized tax benefits of $3.2 million and $3.0 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company expects that unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, if recognized, would have a material impact on the Company’s effective tax rate. The Company is subject to Federal income tax, as well as income tax in various states and foreign jurisdictions. The Company has open tax years for U.S. Federal and state taxes from 2016 through 2020. Various foreign subsidiaries have open tax years from 2003 through 2019, some of which are under audit by local tax authorities. The Company believes that its accruals for uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2020 under ASC 740, Income Taxes are adequate to cover the Company’s income tax exposures. F- 23 INNODATA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The following table represents a roll forward of the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits and associated interest for the years ended (amounts in thousands): Tax Assessments In September 2015, the Company’s Indian subsidiary was subject to an inquiry by the Service Tax Department in India regarding the classification of services provided by this subsidiary, asserting that the services provided by this subsidiary fall under the category of online information and database access or retrieval services (OID Services), and not under the category of business support services (BS Services) that are exempt from service tax as historically indicated in the subsidiary’s service tax filings. The Company disagrees with the Service Tax Department’s position. In November 2019, the Commissioner of Central Tax, GST & Central Excise issued an order confirming the Service Tax Department’s position. The Company is contesting this order in an appeal to the Customs, Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal. In the event the Service Tax Department is ultimately successful in proving that the services fall under the category of OID Services, the revenues earned by the Company’s Indian subsidiary for the period July 2012 through November 2016 would be subject to a service tax of between 12.36% and 15%, and this subsidiary may also be liable for interest and penalties. The revenue of our Indian subsidiary during this period was approximately $64.0 million. In accordance with new rules promulgated by the Service Tax Department, as of December 1, 2016 service tax is no longer applicable to OID or BS Services. Based on the assessment of the Company’s counsel, the Company has not recorded any tax liability for this case. In a separate action relating to service tax refunds, in October 2016, the Company’s Indian subsidiary received notices from the Indian Service Tax Department in India seeking to reverse service tax refunds of approximately $160,000 previously granted to our Indian subsidiary for three quarters in 2014, asserting that the services provided by this subsidiary fall under the category of OID Services and not BS Services. The appeal was determined in favor of the Service Tax Department. The Company disagrees with the basis of this decision and is contesting it. The Company expects delays in its Indian subsidiary receiving further service tax refunds until this matter is adjudicated with finality, and currently has service tax credits of approximately $1.0 million recorded as a receivable. Based on the assessment of the Company’s counsel, the Company has not recorded any tax liability for this case. Substantial recovery against the Company in the above referenced 2015 Service Tax Department case could have a material adverse impact on the Company, and unfavorable rulings or recoveries in other tax proceedings could have a material adverse impact on the consolidated operating results of the period (and subsequent periods) in which the rulings or recovery occurs. Total long-term obligations as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 consisted of the following (in thousands): F- 24 INNODATA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (1) Represents payment to be made pursuant to a settlement agreement entered into in December 2018 between a subsidiary of the Company and 19 former employees of such subsidiary. The balance is payable in monthly installments through March 2023. (2) On April 2020, the Company renewed a vendor agreement to acquire certain additional software licenses and to receive support and subsequent software upgrades on these and other currently owned software licenses through February 2023. Pursuant to this agreement, the Company was obligated to pay approximately $0.4 million annually over the term of the agreement. (3) On May 4, 2020, the Company received loan proceeds of $579,700 under the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) which was established as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act of 2020, as amended. The loans and accrued interest are forgivable, as long as the borrower uses the loan proceeds for eligible purposes, including payroll, benefits, rent and utilities, and maintains its payroll levels. On January 29, 2021, the Company filed its loan forgiveness application for 100% of the approved loan under the PPP . Litigation – In 2008, a judgment was rendered in the Philippines against a Philippine subsidiary of the Company that is no longer active and purportedly also against Innodata Inc., in favor of certain former employees of the Philippine subsidiary. The potential payment amount aggregates to approximately $6.8 million, plus legal interest that accrued at 12% per annum from August 13, 2008 to June 30, 2013, and thereafter accrued and continues to accrue at 6% per annum. The potential payment amount as expressed in U.S. dollars varies with the Philippine peso to U.S. dollar exchange rate. In December 2017, a group of 97 of the former employees of the Philippine subsidiary indicated that they proposed to record the judgment as to themselves in New Jersey. In January 2018, in response to an action initiated by Innodata Inc., the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey (USDC) entered a preliminary injunction that enjoins these former employees from pursuing or seeking recognition or enforcement of the judgment against Innodata Inc. in the United States during the pendency of the action and until further order of the USDC. In June 2018, the USDC entered a consent order administratively closing the action subject to return of the action to the active docket upon the written request of Innodata Inc. or the former employees, with the USDC retaining jurisdiction over the matter and the preliminary injunction remaining in full force and effect. The Company is also subject to various other legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. F- 25 INNODATA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS While management currently believes that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position or overall trends in consolidated results of operations, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties. Substantial recovery against the Company in the above-referenced Philippine action could have a material adverse impact on the Company, and unfavorable rulings or recoveries in the other proceedings could have a material adverse impact on the consolidated operating results of the period in which the ruling or recovery occurs. In addition, the Company’s estimate of the potential impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position or overall consolidated results of operations for the above referenced legal proceedings could change in the future. The Company’s legal accruals related to legal proceedings and claims are based on the Company’s determination of whether or not a loss is probable. The Company reviews outstanding proceedings and claims with external counsel to assess probability and estimates of loss. The accruals are adjusted if necessary. While the Company intends to defend these matters vigorously, adverse outcomes that it estimates could reach approximately $350,000 in the aggregate beyond recorded amounts are reasonably possible. If circumstances change, the Company may be required to record adjustments that could be material to its reported consolidated financial condition and results of operations. Foreign Currency - To the extent that the currencies of the Company’s production facilities located in the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka and Israel fluctuate, the Company is subject to risks of changing costs of production after pricing is established for certain client projects. In addition, the Company is exposed to the risk of foreign currency fluctuation on the non-U.S. dollar denominated revenues, and on the monetary assets and liabilities held by its foreign subsidiaries that are denominated in local currency. Indemnifications - The Company is obligated under certain circumstances to indemnify directors, certain officers and employees against costs and liabilities incurred in actions or threatened actions brought against such individuals because such individuals acted in the capacity of director, officer or fiduciary of the Company. In addition, the Company has contracts with certain clients pursuant to which the Company has agreed to indemnify the client for certain specified and limited claims. These indemnification obligations occur in the ordinary course of business and, in many cases, do not include a limit on potential maximum future payments. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has not recorded a liability for any obligations arising as a result of these indemnification obligations. The Company has various lease agreements for its offices and service delivery centers. The Company has determined that the risks and benefits related to the leased properties are retained by the lessors. Accordingly, these are accounted for as operating leases. These lease agreements are for terms ranging from two to eleven years and, in most cases, provide for rental escalations ranging from 1.75% to 10%. Most of these agreements are renewable at the mutual consent of the parties to the contract. The Company adopted ASU 2016-02 , effective January 1, 2019, and applied the practical expedients consistently for all of its leases. Accordingly, the Company: In addition, the Company elected to retrospectively determine the lease term and assess impairment of the right-of-use asset. F- 26 INNODATA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Under the standard, the Company recognizes an operating lease liability and right-of-use asset. The amount of right-of use asset is equal to the present value of the remaining lease payments discounted using the incremental borrowing rate of each respective country. Modifications, if any are recalculated and corresponding adjustments are made to the carrying values of both the lease liability and right-of-use assets. A right-of-use asset is measured as the amount of the lease liability adjusted for the amount of deferred straight-line rent, prepaid rent and lease incentive allowances previously recognized. The table below summarizes the amounts recognized in the financial statements related to operating leases for the years presented (in thousands): December 31, 2020 The following table presents the maturity profile of the Company’s operating lease liabilities based on the contractual undiscounted payments with a reconciliation of these amounts to the remaining net present value of the operating lease liability reported in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020 (in thousands): The weighted average remaining lease terms and discount rates for all of our operating leases as of December 31, 2020 were as follows: F- 27 INNODATA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS U.S. Defined Contribution Pension Plan - The Company has a defined contribution plan qualified under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, pursuant to which substantially all of its U.S. employees are eligible to participate after completing six months of service. Participants may elect to contribute a portion of their compensation to the plan. Under the plan, the Company has the discretion to match a portion of participants’ contributions. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company did not make any matching contributions. Non-U.S. Pension Benefits - The accounting standard for pensions requires an employer to recognize a net liability or asset and an offsetting adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss to report the funded status of defined benefit pension and other post-retirement benefit plans. Most of the non-U.S. subsidiaries provide for government-mandated defined pension benefits. For certain of these subsidiaries, vested eligible employees are provided a lump sum payment upon retiring from the Company at a defined age. The lump sum amount is based on the salary and tenure as of retirement date. Other non-U.S. subsidiaries provide for a lump sum payment to vested employees on retirement, death, incapacitation or termination of employment, based upon the salary and tenure as of the date employment ceases. The liability for such defined benefit obligations is determined and provided on the basis of actuarial valuations. As of December 31, 2020, these plans were unfunded. Pension expense for foreign subsidiaries totaled approximately $0.8 million and $0.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The following tables set out the status of the non-U.S. pension benefits and the amounts (in thousands) recognized in the Company’s consolidated financial statements and the components of pension costs as of and for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2020: Benefit Obligations: Components of Net Periodic Pension Cost: The accumulated benefit obligation, which represents benefits earned to date, was approximately $3.7 million and $2.9 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. F- 28 INNODATA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 consisted of the following (in thousands): Current accrued benefit cost for pension benefits was included in the current portion of long-term obligations in the consolidated balance sheets. Non-current accrued benefit cost for pension benefits was included in long-term obligations, net of current portion, in the consolidated balance sheets. Actuarial assumptions for all non-U.S. plans are described below. The discount rates are used to measure the year end benefit obligations and the earnings effects for the subsequent year. The assumptions for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2020 were as follows: Estimated Future Benefit Payments: As of December 31, 2020, the following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, were expected to be paid (in thousands): Common Stock - The Company is authorized to issue 75,000,000 shares of common stock. Each share of common stock has one vote. Subject to preferences that may be applicable to any outstanding shares of preferred stock, the holders of common stock are entitled to receive ratably such dividends, if any, as may be declared by the Board of Directors. No common stock dividends have been declared to date. Preferred Stock - The Company is authorized to issue 4,998,000 shares of preferred stock. The Board of Directors is authorized to fix the terms, rights, preferences and limitations of the preferred stock and to issue the preferred stock in series that differ as to their relative terms, rights, preferences and limitations. F- 29 INNODATA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Stockholders Rights Agreement - On February 1, 2019, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right (each, a “Right,” and collectively, the “Rights”) for each outstanding share of the Company’s common stock on February 15, 2019. The description and terms of the Rights are set forth in a Rights Agreement between the Company and American Stock Transfer & Trust Co., as rights agent, dated as of February 1, 2019 (the “Rights Agreement”). Each Right entitles its holder to purchase, under certain conditions, one one-thousandth of a share of Series C Participating Preferred Stock (“Preferred Stock”). Each one one-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock has substantially the same rights as one share of the Company’s common stock. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Rights Agreement, Rights become exercisable ten days after the public announcement that a “Person” has become an “Acquiring Person” (as each such term is defined in the Rights Agreement) by obtaining beneficial ownership of 20% or more of the Company’s outstanding common stock, or, if earlier, ten business days (or a later date determined by the Board of Directors before any Person becomes an Acquiring Person) after a Person begins a tender or exchange offer which, if completed, would result in that Person becoming an Acquiring Person. Any Rights held by an Acquiring Person are void and may not be exercised. If a Person becomes an Acquiring Person, all holders of Rights, except the Acquiring Person, may purchase at the Right’s then-current exercise price, the Company’s common stock having a market value equal to twice the exercise price. Moreover, at any time after a Person becomes an Acquiring Person (unless such Person acquires 50 percent or more of the common stock of the Company then outstanding, as more fully described in the Rights Agreement), the Board of Directors may exchange one share of the Company’s common stock for each outstanding Right (other than rights owned by such Person, which would have become void). In addition, if the Company is acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction after a Person becomes an Acquiring Person, all holders of Rights, except the Acquiring Person, may purchase at the Right’s then-current exercise price, a number of the acquiring company’s common stock having a market value of twice the exercise price. If the Company receives a “qualifying offer” (which includes certain all-cash fully financed tender offers or exchange offers for all of the Company’s outstanding common stock), under certain circumstances, holders of 10 percent of the Company’s outstanding common stock (excluding stock held by the offeror and its affiliates and associates) may direct the Board of Directors to call a special meeting of stockholders to consider a resolution exempting such “qualifying offer” from the Rights Agreement. The Rights themselves have no voting power. The Board of Directors may redeem the Rights at an initial redemption price of $0.001 per Right under certain circumstances set forth in the Rights Agreement. The Rights Agreement was approved by the Company’s stockholders at the 2019 annual meeting. The Rights will expire on January 31, 2022 unless earlier redeemed or exchanged. Common Stock Reserved - As of December 31, 2020, the Company had available for future issuance 2,925,638 shares of common stock pursuant to the Company’s stock option plans. Treasury Stock - In July 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2.0 million of its common stock in open market or private transactions. There is no expiration date associated with the program. The total value of common stock acquired under the plan was $1.5 million as of December 31, 2020. F- 30 INNODATA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS On June 7, 2016, stockholders of the Company approved amendments to the Innodata Inc. 2013 Stock Plan (as amended, the “Plan”). The number of shares of common stock of Innodata Inc. that may be delivered, purchased or used for reference purposes (with respect to stock appreciation rights or stock units) for awards granted under the Plan after June 7, 2016 is 5,858,892 (the Share Reserve). Shares subject to an option or stock appreciation right granted under the Plan after June 7, 2016 count against the Share Reserve as one share for every share granted, and shares subject to any other type of award granted under the Plan after June 7, 2016 count against the Share Reserve as two shares for every share granted. Any award, or portion of an award, under the Plan or under the Company’s 2009 Stock Plan (as amended and restated (the Prior Plan)) that expires or terminates unexercised, becomes unexercisable or is forfeited or otherwise terminated, surrendered or canceled as to any shares without delivery of shares or other consideration will be added back to the Share Reserve as one share for each such share that was subject to an option or stock appreciation right granted under the Plan or the Prior Plan, and two shares for each such share that was subject to an award other than an option or stock appreciation right granted under the Plan or the Prior Plan. If any shares are withheld, tendered or exchanged by a participant in the Plan as full or partial payment to Innodata of the exercise price under an option under the Plan or the Prior Plan or in satisfaction of a participant’s tax withholding obligations with respect to any award under the Plan or the Prior Plan, there will be added back to the Share Reserve one share for each such share that was withheld, tendered or exchanged in respect of an option or stock appreciation right granted under the Plan or the Prior Plan, and two shares for each such share that was withheld, tendered or exchanged in respect of an award other than an option or stock appreciation right granted under the Plan or the Prior Plan. The fair value of stock options is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The weighted-average fair value of the options granted and weighted-average assumptions were as follows: The Company estimates the risk-free interest rate using the U.S. Treasury yield curve for periods equal to the expected term of the options in effect at the time of grant. The expected term of options granted is based on a combination of vesting schedules, term of the options and historical experience. Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the Company’s common stock. The Company uses an expected dividend yield of zero since it has never declared or paid any dividends on its capital stock. F- 31 INNODATA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS A summary of option activity under the Plans as of December 31, 2020, and changes during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, is presented below: The total compensation cost related to non-vested stock options not yet recognized as of December 31, 2020 totals approximately $1.1 million. The weighted-average period over which these costs will be recognized is 21 months. A summary of restricted shares under the Company’s Plan are presented below: Accumulated other comprehensive loss, as reflected in the consolidated balance sheets, consists of pension liability adjustments, net of taxes, foreign currency translation adjustment and changes in fair value of derivatives, net of taxes. The components of accumulated other comprehensive loss as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive loss for the years then ended, are presented below (in thousands): F- 32 INNODATA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS All reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive loss had an impact on direct operating costs in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). The Company’s operations are classified in three reporting segments: Digital Data Solutions (DDS), Synodex and Agility. The DDS segment provides a range of solutions and platforms for solving complex data challenges that companies face when they seek to obtain the benefits of AI systems and analytics platforms. These include data annotation, data transformation, data curation and intelligent automation. The DDS segment also provides a variety of services for clients in the information industry that relate to content operations and product development. The Synodex segment provides an intelligent data platform that transforms medical records into useable digital data organized in accordance with our proprietary data models or client data models. The Agility segment provides an intelligent data platform that provides marketing communications and public relations professionals with the ability to target and distribute content to journalists and social media influencers world-wide and to monitor and analyze global news channels (print, web, radio and TV) and social media channels. A significant portion of the Company’s revenues is generated from its locations in the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka, Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom and Israel. F- 33 INNODATA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Revenues from external clients and segment operating profit (loss), and other reportable segment information were as follows (in thousands): F- 34 INNODATA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Long-lived assets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 by geographic region were comprised of (in thousands): One client in the DDS segment generated approximately 14% and 16% of the Company’s total revenues in the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Another client in the DDS segment generated 10% of the Company’s total revenues for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. No other client accounted for 10% or more of total revenues during these periods. Further, in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, revenues from non-US clients accounted for 54% and 55%, respectively, of the Company's revenues. Revenues for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 by geographic region (determined based upon client’s domicile), were as follows (in thousands): As of December 31, 2020, approximately 55% of the Company's accounts receivable was due from foreign (principally European) clients and 36% of accounts receivable was due from three clients. As of December 31, 2019, approximately 60% of the Company's accounts receivable was due from foreign (principally European) clients and 44% of accounts receivable was due from three clients. No other client accounted for 10% or more of the accounts receivable as of December 31, 2020. F- 35 INNODATA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Basic income (loss) per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted income per share is computed by considering the impact of the potential issuance of common shares, using the treasury stock method, on the weighted average number of shares outstanding. For those securities that are not convertible into a class of common stock, the two-class method of computing loss per share is used. Options to purchase 1.6 million shares of common stock for the year ended December 31, 2020, were outstanding but not included in the computation of diluted income (loss) per share because the exercise price of the options were greater than the average market price of the common shares and therefore have not been considered as potential equity shares. Options to purchase 6.8 million shares of common stock for the year ended December 31, 2019 were outstanding but not included in the computation of diluted loss per share because the effect would have been anti-dilutive. The Company conducts a large portion of its operations in international markets which subject it to foreign currency fluctuations. The most significant foreign currency exposures occur when revenue and associated accounts receivable are collected in one currency and expenses to generate that revenue are incurred in another currency. The Company is also subject to wage inflation and other government mandated increases and operating expenses in Asian countries where the Company has the majority of its operations. The Company’s primary inflation and exchange rate exposure relates to payroll, other payroll costs and operating expenses in the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka and Israel. In addition, although most of the Company’s revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars, a significant portion of total revenues is denominated in Canadian dollars, Pound Sterling and Euros. The Company was previously following hedge accounting guidelines and formally documented all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking hedge transactions. However, commencing November 2020, the Company discontinued this practice. The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. All derivatives are recognized at their fair value and classified based on the instrument’s maturity date. The total notional amount for outstanding derivatives was $6.9 million and $4.3 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. F- 36 INNODATA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The following table presents the fair value of derivative instruments included within the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands): The effect of foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges on the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows (in thousands): (1) Net change in fair value of the effective portion classified into other comprehensive income (""OCI"") (2) Effective portion classified within direct operating costs (3) There were no ineffective portions for the period presented.

Item 1. Business. Business Overview Innodata Inc. (NASDAQ: INOD) (including its subsidiaries, the “Company”, “Innodata”, “we”, “us” or “our”) is a global data engineering company. We solve complex data challenges that companies face when they build and maintain artificial intelligence (AI) systems and analytics platforms. To deliver our services and solutions, we use a combination of human expertise and technology. Our 3,000+ employees span 10 countries and are experts in data pertaining to many professional fields. Our core technology harnesses machine learning and deep learning (branches of AI) to augment human expertise. Our hybrid approach of using AI in conjunction with human experts enables us to deliver superior data quality with even the most complex and sensitive data. We also provide AI-augmented software-as-a-service (SaaS) platforms for customers who wish to perform their own data engineering tasks and for niche, industry-specific data-intensive use cases. We developed our capabilities and honed our customer- and quality-centric culture progressively over the last 20 years providing data services for many of the world’s most demanding information companies. Approximately three years ago, we formed Innodata Labs, a research and development center, that developed and applied machine learning and emerging AI to our large-scale, human-intensive data operations. Last year, we began packaging the capabilities that emerged from this effort in order to address the large and growing market of enterprises that seek data engineering services to harness data and AI to drive analytics and performance. Market Opportunity Companies across industry verticals are increasingly seeking to develop AI-based applications for an ever-increasing variety of use cases such as self-driving cars, surveillance systems, automated medical diagnostics, digital assistants and chatbots and contract review. These applications depend upon high-performing AI algorithms in areas such as speech recognition, image recognition, and text recognition. For AI-based algorithms to perform accurately, they need to be trained on large amounts of high-quality data. The problem is that many projects fail, stall or perform inadequately because data sciences teams are unable to perform the complex and resource-intensive data preparation tasks necessary to properly train, tune, and operationalize AI models. Innodata seeks to become the world’s leading data engineering company, helping data scientists with their most complex and mission-critical data preparation tasks. Preparing high-quality data takes up 80% of the time for most AI and machine learning projects. Data preparation includes data annotation (which is estimated to take up 25% of the time) and data transformation (which includes data identification, aggregation, cleansing and augmentation and is estimated to take 55% of the time). 1 Moreover, many data sciences teams lack the technology and resources to perform data annotation and data transformation tasks. In a recent survey, 19% of companies responding stated that lack of data or data quality issues was a main bottleneck holding back further AI adoption. 2 An IBM senior vice president of cloud and cognitive software recently conceded that data-related challenges are a top reason IBM clients have halted or canceled AI projects. 3 1 Cognilytica Research, Data Engineering, Preparation, and Labeling for AI in 2019 (January 31, 2019) 2 O’Reilly Media Inc., AI Adoption in the Enterprise: How Companies Are Planning and Prioritizing AI Projects in Practice (2019) 3 Jared Council, Data Challenges Are Halting AI Projects, IBM Executive Says , Wall Street Journal , May 28, 2019, https://www.wsj.com/articles/data-challenges-are-halting-ai-projects-ibm-executive-says-11559035800 (last visited March 16, 2020). Increasingly, data sciences teams seek partners that can perform data preparation functions for them at large-scale and at high quality, while using automated tools to minimize cost. Moreover, as AI projects become more specialized and mission-critical, data preparation is becoming increasingly complex, requiring deep domain knowledge and an infrastructure in which data security is assured. We believe that Innodata is ideally situated to be such a partner. The market for AI and machine learning-relevant data preparation solutions is estimated to grow from $1.5 billion in 2019 to $3.5 billion by the end of 2024. 4 Competitive Strengths Our Data Quality We believe we achieve industry-leading data quality by leveraging our technology, our large staff of human experts, and the culture we have cultivated over many years of providing high-quality data to the most demanding customers. For the past three years, we have been designing and refining our approach for combining human experts and AI to produce large-scale, highly accurate data. In our approach, AI networks automatically perform much of the required processing and human experts perform processing that the AI cannot perform at a high level of confidence. The human output is fed back into the AI network, which, as a result, “learns” and becomes “smarter” over time, achieving progressively greater levels of automation while maintaining the highest levels of quality. ( See “Our Technology and Infrastructure”, below. ) Our 3,000+ experts have deep domain knowledge in a wide diversity of data domains. They are selected on the basis of data acumen, analytical ability, and deep domain proficiency. ( See “Our Domain Experts”, below. ) Our culture of quality is critical to achieving and sustaining high data quality. Our culture has been cultivated over our decades of experience performing data-related tasks for leading global companies, including the four largest global information companies with which we have 10-plus year relationships building and maintaining many of their leading data products. We maintain independent quality assurance centers that comply with and are certified to the ISO 9001:2008 quality management system standards. Our Domain Experts We have over 3,000 employees with deep data domain expertise in various fields, including law, sciences, health, finance, and technology. Many of them hold advanced degrees. They process data in over 25 languages. Most work from our global operations centers in India, Israel, Sri Lanka and the Philippines. For annotating complex or sensitive data, our expert staff provides an attractive alternative to the crowdsourced labor pools utilized by many of our competitors typically for mundane tasks. They are especially well-suited for high-context data, such as legal contract classification, medical images, medical records, and scientific and legal literature. 4 Cognilytica Research, Data Engineering, Preparation, and Labeling for AI 2020 (January 31, 2020) Our Technology Over the past three years, we have built a technology infrastructure that automates complex data annotation and data transformation tasks. Our technology infrastructure combines advanced dataflow, deep learning (a branch of AI), and purpose-built applications used by human experts, which we refer to as “workbenches”. This infrastructure enables us to perform data annotation and data transformation at progressively higher levels of efficiency without compromising quality as it continuously learns from human experts. Our dataflow technology enables us to configure workflows for specific data annotation and transformation requirements. This is where we oversee and manage our AI, setting and refining our accuracy thresholds and quality assurance parameters that route data for human expert review when required. We have built and deployed our AI as a suite of domain-specific and task-specific microservices each of which performs a discrete data-related task automatically. The AI microservices have a range of capabilities for data annotation and data transformation including deep sequence labelling, categorization, segmentation and sequence-to-sequence mapping. For each cognitive task an AI microservice performs, it provides a confidence score. A confidence score at or above an established accuracy threshold means no human expert review is required. A confidence score below an established accuracy threshold means human expert review is required. When expert review is required, the dataflow automatically routes data to an appropriate human expert. Our human experts use workbenches that enable them to quickly and efficiently review the data and make judgements. The workbenches then retroactively feed back the expert-reviewed work into the deep neural network, enabling it to learn and become smarter. This feature is commonly known as “human-in-the-loop”. It results in continuous, predictable improvement and progressively greater levels of automation. Our Infrastructure Our infrastructure supports a range of strategies to suit our clients’ needs for data security, compliance, scalability and reliability. We host data and applications in our own data centers at our operations centers, in our clients’ data centers, and on third-party cloud services that provide the benefit of “infinite scalability” of hardware resources. Our data operations are linked by multi-redundant data connections. Our Wide Area Network – along with our Local Area Networks, Storage Area Networks and data centers – is configured with industry standard redundancy, often with more than one backup to establish 24x7 availability. In 2019, our Wide Area Network had 99.96% uptime excluding scheduled maintenance. We encrypt all sensitive information, both at rest and in motion, to the Advanced Encryption Standard 256 or similar standard, and we employ a range of security features, including managed firewalls and intrusion services. ( See “Information Security”, below. ) Our Breath of Capabilities We are able to address clients at their highest point of need. For example, we may provide data annotation for a data sciences team building an application to manage complex text documents. For another client with the same requirement but without a sophisticated data sciences team, we might provide our data transformation solution that extracts key data points from the contracts using our trained AI algorithms and outputs normalized digital data into its existing application via an API. For still another client that also lacks such an application, we would provide our data analytics platform. In addition, we are able to provide a wide range of data transformation services to meet clients’ requirements. For example, for clients needing to aggregate data from thousands of web pages prior to annotating the data, we deploy AI-enabled web extraction technology together with transformations that convert web pages and PDF documents into digital text. Growth Strategy Our strategy for growth is to become the world’s leading data engineering company. Toward this end, in 2019 we re-designed our solutions and product portfolio in order to address the needs of enterprises across verticals for data annotation and data transformation. These solutions and products leverage the data services we have provided historically for large information companies and the significant investments we have made in AI technology over the past three years. By expanding our product offerings in this way, we also aim to dramatically expand our addressable market, creating greater opportunities for the Company’s growth. While our historical core market for providing data services to information companies is relatively small (estimated by us to be approximately $250 million and to not show growth over the next several years), the market for AI and machine learning-relevant data preparation solutions is estimated to grow from $1.5 billion in 2019 to $3.5 billion by the end of 2024 5 , propelled by overall enterprise AI spend that is projected to reach $53.06 billion by 2026, registering a CAGR of 35.4% from 2019 to 2026. 6 In addition to expanding our core addressable market, we intend to shift our revenue mix from “services” to “solutions” and “SaaS products”. We differentiate “solutions” from “services” by the extent to which they are repeatable, address generalized requirements, and are technology-enabled. Solutions and SaaS products tend to result in revenue that produces relatively higher margins and is often recurring in nature. We believe that as we grow revenue, our business model will enable us to achieve operating income growth that is a multiple of revenue growth. In order to execute our strategy, we have recruited senior product management and technology executives, expanded our direct sales team, refreshed our messaging and visual identity, and expanded our digital marketing and product engineering functions. In 2020, we also intend to drive additional operational savings wherever possible and to simplify our business by continuing to review our product portfolio and test purposefulness of individual assets against our mission and strategic objectives. Products and Services Our Solutions and Platforms We provide a range of solutions and platforms for solving complex data challenges that companies face when they seek to obtain the benefits of AI systems and analytics platforms. We help our clients train AI models by annotating data at scale and at industry-leading levels of quality such as 99.995% accuracy with an error rate that does not exceed 50 per million. The quality of training data is critical for ensuring that a client’s AI models perform well. We annotate text, images, audio and video data for the most complex AI models, including computer vision, sentiment analysis, entity linking, text categorization, and syntactic parsing/tagging. 5 Cognilytica Research, Data Engineering, Preparation, and Labeling for AI 2020 (January 31, 2020) 6 Allied Market Research, Enterprise Artificial Intelligence (AI) Market Outlook-2026 (2020) Our image and video annotation services and platforms may be used to annotate, or label, objects or people in images/video for facial recognition systems and automated object identification systems and in aerial/satellite imagery for autonomous driving/flying applications. Our text annotation services and platforms may be used to convert raw text data into richly tagged, AI training data. We accommodate a wide range of input formats and taxonomies, and we perform a wide variety of complex tasks including entity annotation, relationship annotation, co-reference annotation, event annotation, multi-label annotation, and document labelling. We provide image/video data annotation and text annotation as full solutions, in which we provide all required technology, infrastructure and expert resources. Beginning in early 2020, we will also provide image/video data annotation platforms and text annotation platforms for our clients to license for internal use. We provide data annotation for a variety of complex requirements in healthcare, compliance, scientific, financial and legal markets. We provide AI-based data transformation solutions for high-accuracy data identification, aggregation, cleansing, augmentation and extraction. Our solutions utilize highly-trained AI models and experts who custom-train the models for our clients’ most complex and unique requirements. Our data transformation platform enables data to be extracted from websites, as well as internal data stores; converted from disparate formats including PDF; enriched with the necessary semantics, metadata and linking; and classified in accordance with an ontology or knowledge graph. Our data transformation solutions may be consumed via API, so that they can be utilized as infrastructure by clients with ongoing needs for such services. We also provide a platform for clients to license for performing analytics on extracted data points. For clients that need to maintain mission-critical databases of structured data, or fuse separately-created databases into a single, unified, high-quality source of data that can be relied upon for a variety of corporate functions and products (often referred to as a “golden source” of data), we provide AI-based data curation solutions that include data collection across external and internal data sources, data hygiene, data consolidation, and data compliance. Enterprises are increasingly looking to re-invent business processes to take advantage of advancements in AI and machine learning, computing, and storage. Many seek easier ways these advanced capabilities can be trained, deployed, and leveraged. For clients with critical business processes that involve documents, images, text, emails and other unstructured data, we deploy a range of technologies, including AI and robotic process automation (RPA), to eliminate repetitive tasks, automate where possible, speed up operations, and shift internal talent to creative and analytical work. We provide intelligent automation for an increasing diversity of complex functions. At present, these include IP rights management, contract management, client relationship management, regulatory change management, underwriting, and content operations management. We build and manage intelligent data platforms that address specific, niche market requirements with our data engineering technologies. We deploy these platforms as software-as-a-service (SaaS) and as managed data solutions. To date, we have built an intelligent data platform for medical records data transformation (which we brand as “Synodex”) and for marketing communications/public relations workflow (which we brand as “Agility”). Our Synodex intelligent data platform transforms medical records into useable digital data organized in accordance with our proprietary data models or client data models. At the end of 2019, we had 20 clients utilizing our Synodex platform, including John Hancock Insurance, the insurance operating unit of John Hancock Financial (a division of Manulife) and one of the largest life insurers in the United States. Our Agility intelligent data platform provides marketing communications and public relations professionals with the ability to target and distribute content to journalists and social media influencers world-wide and to monitor and analyze global news channels (print, web, radio and TV) and social media channels. Agility has recently been rated as superior to both of its largest competitors in the PR analytics marketplace in all of the separately rated categories (including “meets requirements”, “ease of use”, “ease of doing business with”, “quality of support”, “ease of administration”, “ease of set-up” and “contact/campaign management”) based on customer reviews. 7 The Company’s operations are presently classified and reported in three reporting segments: Digital Data Solutions (DDS), Synodex and Agility. In addition, we provide a variety of services for clients in the information industry that relate to content operations and product development. Our Customers Our customers include leading businesses across multiple verticals including banking, insurance, financial services, technology, digital retailing and information/media. Two customers each generated 10% or more of our total revenues in the 2019 and 2018 fiscal years. In 2019, revenues from these two customers were approximately $8.9 million or 16% of total revenues, and approximately $5.7 million or 10% of total revenues, respectively. No other client generated more than 10% of our total revenues in 2019. These two clients together generated approximately 26% and 30% of our total revenues in the fiscal years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 7 G2 Crowd Inc. https://www.g2.com/compare/agility-pr-solutions-vs-cision-communications-cloud ; https://www.g2.com/compare/agility-pr-solutions-vs-meltwater We have long-standing relationships with many of our clients, and we have provided services to the two clients referenced in the preceding paragraph for over ten years. Our track record of delivering high-quality services helps us to solidify client relationships. Many of our clients are recurring clients, meaning that they have continued to provide additional projects to us after our initial engagement with them. Our agreements with our clients are in many cases terminable on 30 to 90 days’ notice. A substantial portion of the services we provide to our clients is subject to their requirements. Sales and Marketing We market and sell our solutions and platforms directly through our professional staff, senior management and direct sales personnel operating primarily from various locations in the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom and Europe. In addition, we are increasingly developing and expanding our use of strategic partnerships and channel relationships for the establishment and development of new and existing clients. In addition to our executive-level business development and marketing professionals and sales and marketing personnel, we also deploy solutions architects, technical support experts and consultants who support the development of new clients and new client engagements. These resources work within teams (both permanent and ad hoc) that provide support to clients. Our marketing department and sales professionals work together to generate leads. Our sales professionals identify and qualify prospects, securing direct personal access to decision makers at existing and prospective clients. They facilitate interactions between client personnel and our service teams to define ways in which we can assist clients with their goals. For each prospective client engagement, we assemble a team of our senior employees drawn from various disciplines within our Company. The team members assume assigned roles in a formalized process, using their combined knowledge and experience to understand the client’s goals and collaborate with the client on a solution. Our marketing organization is responsible for developing and increasing the visibility and awareness of our brand and our service offerings, defining and communicating our value proposition, generating qualified, early-stage leads and furnishing effective sales support tools. As part of our marketing strategy we partner with media organizations to build awareness, establish a reputation as an industry thought leader, and generate leads. Media partners include trade associations and publications, trade show producers and consulting organizations. These partnerships are particularly valuable in enterprise industries as we build our presence among digital content leaders and decision makers. Primary marketing outreach activities include content marketing, event marketing (including exhibiting at trade shows, conferences and seminars), direct and database marketing, public and media relations (including speaking engagements), and web marketing (including integrated marketing campaigns, search engine optimization, search engine marketing and the maintenance and continued development of external websites). Sales activities include lead generation, nurturing leads, engaging in discussions with prospective clients to understand their needs, demonstrating our products, designing solutions, responding to requests for proposals, and managing account and client relationships and activities. Personnel from our solutions analysis group, our client services group and our engineering services group closely support our direct sales effort. These individuals assist the sales force in understanding the technical needs of clients and providing responses to these needs, including demonstrations, prototypes, pricing quotations and time estimates. In addition, account managers from our client service group support our direct sales effort by providing ongoing project-level support to our clients.

This infrastructure enables us to perform data annotation and data transformation at progressively improved levels of efficiency without compromising quality as it continuously learns from human experts. Our dataflow technology enables us to configure workflows for specific data annotation and transformation requirements. This is where we oversee and manage AI, set our accuracy thresholds and quality assurance parameters that route data for human expert review when required. We have built and deployed our AI as a suite of domain-specific and task-specific microservices each of which performs a discrete data-related task automatically. Our microservices are built on frameworks such as TensorFlow that layer algorithms to create artificial neural networks. Each AI microservice may be invoked by the dataflow via a RESTful API. The AI microservices have a range of capabilities for data annotation and data transformation including deep sequence labelling, categorization, segmentation and sequence-to-sequence mapping. Many complex data problems can be solved with a combination of these microservices. For each cognitive task an AI microservice performs, it provides a confidence score.

It results in continuous, predictable improvement and progressively greater levels of automation. To support our Agility intelligent automation platform, we have built a fully scalable, cloud-based infrastructure that powers a SaaS experience for global clients on a 24/7 basis. It includes (i) an AI/ML-powered big data platform that indexes two billion media items per year, powering media monitoring, media enrichment, and media database APIs; (ii) a full targeting workflow platform that integrates media targeting, content curation, content distribution, integrated newswires, and a newsroom; (iii) a comprehensive database of more than 800 thousand global media influencers and journalists; (iv) a media monitoring and analytics engine; and (v) a workflow platform for media database research combining AI and machine learning to streamline research workflows for discovery and maintenance of our database. To support our Synodex intelligent automation platform, we have built technologies for transforming analogue medical records and output of electronic health records (EHR) systems into digital data conforming to proprietary insurance medical data dictionaries that span diseases and impairments, diagnostic tests, pharmacology and support industry standard codes such as ICD-10 as well as rules engines for processing and displaying the digital data. Reliability and Availability Our data storage and application hosting platform has been built utilizing an innovative enterprise infrastructure platform enabling robust performance scaling, strong security, high availability, and advanced business continuity. We support a range of strategies to suit our clients’ needs for data security, compliance, scalability and reliability. We host data and applications in our own data centers at our production facilities, in our clients’ data centers, and on third-party cloud services which provide the benefit of “infinite scalability” of hardware resources. Information Security Our operations centers in Asia are ISO 27001 certified. When we are processing sensitive information, we utilize U.S.-based, co-located data centers in combination with advanced data encryption (both at rest and in motion to the Advanced Encryption Standard 256 or similar standard) and desktop virtualization technologies, safeguarding against that data leaving secured environments in the U.S. We employ a range of security features including monitored firewalls and intrusion detection devices. We can deploy on-premises, as well, and utilize appropriately certified cloud resources. Our AI microservices can be consumed via API. Government Regulation We are subject to a number of U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations that relate to our business, including those governing privacy and data protection. We comply with the requirements of the United States Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 as amended (including by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Data (HITECH)) (HIPAA), the United Kingdom’s Data Protection Act 2018, the EU General Data Protection Regulation, and local laws regulating data privacy, as applicable. We are certified to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework. Research and Development Our Innodata Labs develops AI-based technologies that we utilize in our operations and with our clients. The Innodata Labs team is comprised of data scientists, including data scientists who have published leading papers on discrete topics in data science and have earned PhD degrees in fields such as data entity extraction. Employees As of December 31, 2019, we employed 134 persons in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, and 3,506 persons in ten global delivery centers in the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka, Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom and Israel, and 3,599 of our employees are full-time. Many of our employees hold advanced degrees in law, business, technology, medicine and social sciences. No employees are currently represented by a labor union, and we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory. Corporate Offices Our principal executive offices are located at 55 Challenger Road, Ridgefield Park, New Jersey 07660, just outside New York City, and our telephone number is (201) 371-8000. We have additional office locations in Ottawa, Canada, and London, the United Kingdom. We have eight operations centers in the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka, Germany, and Israel. We were founded in 1988. Our website is www.innodata.com ; information contained on our website is not included as a part of, or incorporated by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K. There we make available, free of charge, our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file that material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Our SEC reports can be obtained through the Investor Relations section of our website or from the Securities and Exchange Commission at www.sec.gov . Item 1A. Risk Factors. The risks and uncertainties set forth below, as well as other factors described elsewhere in this Form 10-K or in other filings by the Company with the SEC, could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to the Company or that are not currently believed by the Company to be material may also harm the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. We have historically relied on a very limited number of clients that have accounted for a significant portion of our revenues, and our results of operations could be adversely affected if we were to lose one or more of these significant clients. We have historically relied on a very limited number of clients that have accounted for a significant portion of our revenues. Two clients in our DDS segment generated approximately 26% and 30% of our total revenues in the fiscal years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. No other client accounted for 10% or more of total revenues during these periods. Further, in the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, revenues from non-U.S. clients accounted for 55% and 56%, respectively, of our revenues. We may lose any of these clients, or our other major clients, as a result of our failure to meet or satisfy our client’s requirements, the completion or termination of a project or engagement, or the client’s selection of another service provider. In addition, the volume of work performed for our major clients may vary from year to year, and services they require from us may change from year to year. They may also request that we modify certain key terms of our agreements with them as a condition of continuing to do business with us. If the volume of work performed for our major clients varies, if the services they require from us change, or if they require price concessions, our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected, and we may incur a loss from operations. If certain key terms of our agreements with our major clients are modified, our revenues and results of operations may be adversely affected. Our services are typically subject to client requirements, and in many cases are terminable upon 30 to 90 days’ notice. The loss of these clients or a significant variation in the volume of work performed for these clients may have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition and results of operations. We have no bank facilities or line of credit. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and internally generated funds will provide sufficient sources of liquidity to satisfy our financial needs for the next 12 months. However, we have no bank facilities or lines of credit, and reductions in our cash and cash equivalents from operating losses, capital expenditures, adverse legal decisions, acquisitions or other events affecting our access to capital could materially and adversely affect the Company. See “Management Discussion and Analysis – Liquidity and Capital Resources” for additional information. Our common stock may become subject to delisting from The Nasdaq Stock Market (the “Nasdaq”). Our common stock is currently listed on the Nasdaq Global Market. Nasdaq may, under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810, delist the Company’s common stock if the closing bid price for its common stock is less than $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive business days and the Company does not thereafter cure all listing deficiencies during Nasdaq-designated compliance periods. If we fail to meet the requirements for continued listing on the Nasdaq, our common stock could be delisted from trading, which would decrease the liquidity of our common stock and our ability to raise additional capital. A portion of our services is provided on a non-recurring basis for specific projects, and our inability to replace large projects when they are completed or otherwise terminated has adversely affected, and could in the future adversely affect, our revenues and results of operations. We provide a portion of our services for specific projects that generate revenues that terminate on completion of a defined task. While we seek, whenever possible, on completion or termination of large projects, to counterbalance periodic declines in revenues with new arrangements to provide services to the same client or others, our inability to obtain sufficient new projects to counterbalance any decreases in such work may adversely affect our future revenues and results of operations. A portion of our revenue is generated from projects that we characterize as recurring in nature. Projects that we characterize as recurring are nevertheless subject to termination. Our operating performance is materially dependent on the continuation of these projects. However, we are exposed to risks where these projects could be terminated by our clients and we may not be able to replace these terminated projects with new recurring projects with similar profitability or clients may ask for a price reduction, which could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations. Our solutions for the Agility segment are sold pursuant to subscription agreements, and if subscription clients elect either not to renew these agreements, or to renew these agreements for less expensive services, our revenues and results of operations will be adversely affected. Our Agility segment derives its revenues primarily from subscription arrangements. Our clients may choose not to renew subscription agreements when they expire or may renew them at lower prices or for a significantly narrower scope of work. If large numbers of existing subscription clients do not renew these agreements or renew these agreements on terms less favorable to us, and if we cannot replace or supplement those non-renewals with new subscription agreements generating the same or greater levels of revenue, our revenues and results of operations will be adversely affected. New acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic investments or partnerships could harm our operating results. We may pursue acquisitions, joint ventures or engage in strategic investments or partnerships to grow and enhance our capabilities. We cannot assure that we will successfully consummate any acquisitions or joint ventures, or profit by strategic investments, or achieve desired financial and operating results. Further, such activities involve a number of risks and challenges, including proper evaluation, diversion of management’s attention and proper integration with our current business. Accordingly, we might fail to realize the expected benefits or strategic objectives of any such venture we undertake. If we are unable to complete the kind of acquisitions for which we plan, we may not be able to achieve our planned rates of growth, profitability or competitive position in specific markets or services. A large portion of our accounts receivable is payable by a limited number of clients; the inability of any of these clients to pay its accounts receivable could adversely affect our results of operations. Several significant clients account for a large percentage of our accounts receivable. If any of these clients were unable, or refused, for any reason, to pay our accounts receivable, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. As of December 31, 2019, 44% or $4.3 million, of our accounts receivable was due from three clients. See “ Management Discussion and Analysis – Liquidity and Capital Resources”. In addition, we evaluate the financial condition of our clients prior to extending credit to them. We maintain specific allowances against doubtful receivables. Actual losses on client balances could differ from those that we currently anticipate and, as a result, we might need to adjust our allowances. There is no guarantee that we will accurately assess the creditworthiness of our clients. Macroeconomic conditions could also result in financial difficulties, including limited access to the credit markets, insolvency or bankruptcy, for our clients, and, as a result, could cause clients to delay payments to us, request modifications to their payment arrangements that could increase our receivables balance, or default on their payment obligations to us. If we are unable to collect timely from our clients, our cash flows could be adversely affected. Quarterly fluctuations in our revenues and results of operations could make financial forecasting difficult and could negatively affect our stock price. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, significant fluctuations in our quarterly revenues and results of operations. During the past eight quarters, our net income ranged from income of approximately $0.5 million in the third quarter of 2018 to a loss of approximately $0.7 million in the second quarter of 2019. We experience fluctuations in our revenue and earnings as we replace and begin new projects, which may have some normal start-up delays, or we may be unable to replace a project entirely or on terms that are as attractive to us as the project that is being replaced. These and other factors may contribute to fluctuations in our results of operations from quarter to quarter. A high percentage of our operating expenses, particularly personnel and rent, are relatively fixed in advance of any particular quarter. As a result, unanticipated variations in the number and timing of our projects, or in employee wage levels and utilization rates, may cause us to significantly underutilize our production capacity and employees, resulting in significant variations in our operating results in any particular quarter, and have resulted in losses. The economic environment and pricing pressures could negatively impact our revenues and operating results. Due to the intense competition involved in outsourcing and information technology services, we generally face pricing pressures from our clients due to competition from other companies in our markets. Our ability to maintain or increase pricing is restricted as clients generally expect to receive volume discounts or special pricing incentives as we do more business with them; moreover, our large clients may exercise pressure for discounts outside of agreed terms. Our profitability could suffer if we are not able to maintain pricing on our existing projects and win new projects at appropriate margins. If our pricing structures do not accurately anticipate the cost and complexity of performing our work, then our contracts could be unprofitable. Our profit margin, and therefore our profitability, is dependent on the rates we are able to charge for our services measured against the costs of providing the services. If we are not able to maintain pricing on our existing services and win new projects at profitable margins, or if we underestimate the costs or complexities of new projects and incur losses, our profitability could suffer. The amounts we are able to recover for our services are affected by a number of factors, including competition, volume fluctuations, productivity of employees and processes, the value our client derives from our services and general economic and political conditions. Furthermore, we provide services either on a time-and-materials basis or on a fixed-price basis. Our pricing is highly dependent on our internal forecasts and predictions about our projects, which might be based on limited data and could turn out to be inaccurate. If we do not accurately estimate the costs and timing for completing projects, our contracts could prove unprofitable for us or yield lower profit margins than anticipated. We may not be able to obtain price increases that are necessary to offset the effect of wage inflation and other government mandated cost increases. We have experienced wage inflation and other government mandated cost increases in the Asian countries where we have the majority of our operations. In addition, we may experience adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. These global events have put pressure on our profitability and our margins. Although we have tried to partially offset wage increases, foreign currency fluctuations and other such increases through price increases and improving our efficiency, we cannot ensure that we will be able to continue to do so in the future, which could negatively impact our results of operations. If our clients are not satisfied with our services, they may terminate our contracts with them or our services and we may suffer reputational damage, which could have an adverse impact on our business. Our business model depends in large part on our ability to attract additional work from our base of existing clients. Our business model also depends on relationships our account teams develop with our clients so that we can understand our clients’ needs and deliver solutions and services that are tailored to those needs. If a client is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us, or with the type of services or solutions delivered, then we could incur additional costs to address the situation, the profitability of that work might be impaired, and the client’s dissatisfaction with our services could damage our ability to obtain additional work from that client. In particular, clients that are not satisfied might seek to terminate existing contracts, which could mean that we could incur costs for the services performed with no associated revenue upon termination of a contract. This could also direct future business to our competitors. In addition, negative publicity related to our client services or relationships, regardless of its accuracy, may further damage our business by affecting our reputation and our ability to compete for new contracts with current and prospective clients. Our new clients may sunset their products because of lack of sufficient revenues or declining revenues, and this may result in termination of our work for these clients. As we obtain new opportunities and win new business, our clients may not generate the level of revenues that we initially anticipated at the time of signing a contract with them, or our clients may experience declining revenues with their existing products. This could be due to various reasons beyond our control, and it could lead to termination of projects or contracts. As we normally invest in people and technology and incur other costs in anticipation of revenues, any such deviation from our expected plan could impact our margins and earnings. Our business will suffer if we fail to develop new services and enhance our existing services in order to keep pace with the rapidly evolving technological environment or to provide new service offerings, which may not succeed. The information technology and consulting services industries are characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, changing client preferences, new product and service introductions and the emergence of new vendors with lean cost and flexible cost models. Our future success will depend on our ability to develop solutions that keep pace with changes in the markets in which we provide services. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in developing new services, addressing evolving technologies on a timely or cost-effective basis or, if these services are developed, that we will be successful in the marketplace. We also cannot guarantee that we will be able to compete effectively with new vendors offering lean cost and flexible cost models, or that products, services or technologies developed by others will not render our services non-competitive or obsolete. Our failure to address these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We invest in developing and pursuing new service offerings from time to time. Our profitability could be reduced if these services do not yield the profit margins we expect, or if the new service offerings do not generate the planned revenues. We have made and continue to make significant investments towards building-out new capabilities to pursue growth. These investments increase our costs, and if these services do not yield the revenues or profit margins we expect, and we are unable to grow our business and revenue proportionately, our profitability may be reduced, or we may incur losses. We depend on third-party technology in the provision of our services. We rely upon certain software that we license from third parties, including software integrated with our internally developed software used in the provision of our services. These third-party software licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable or competitive terms, if at all. The loss of, or inability to maintain or obtain any of these software licenses, could result in delays in the provision of our services until we develop, identify, license and integrate equivalent software. Any delay in the provision of our services could damage our business and adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, our Company utilizes third party data centers to serve our clients and generate revenue. Any disruption in the provision of services from these data centers could result in loss of revenue, client dissatisfaction and loss of clients. Our Agility segment relies on third parties to provide certain content and data for our solutions. The cessation by third parties to provide their content has adversely affected, and could in the future adversely affect, our revenue and results of operations. Our Agility segment relies on third parties to provide or make available certain data for our information databases and our news and social media monitoring service. These third parties, in the past, have restricted access to certain content and may not renew agreements to provide content to us or may increase the price they charge for their content. Additionally, the quality of the content provided to us may not be acceptable to us and we may need to enter into agreements with additional third parties. In the event we are unable to use or have access to such third-party content or are unable to enter into agreements with new third parties, current clients may discontinue their relationship with us, and it may be difficult to acquire new clients. Our businesses are reliant on key employees, and we may face high attrition in our talent. We may not be able to replace displaced talent with new talent on a timely basis or with equivalent skill sets. We are, to a considerable degree, reliant on the continuing leadership of our Chief Executive Officer and would be materially and adversely affected should he unexpectedly cease to be employed by us. In addition, our businesses are subject to fierce competition for talent, which could result in high attrition of our employees, or we may not be able to find the requisite talent to operate our businesses. A significant increase in the attrition rate among employees with specialized skills could decrease our operating efficiency and productivity. Our failure to attract, train and retain personnel with the qualifications necessary to fulfill the needs of our existing and future clients or to assimilate new employees successfully could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, fluctuations in our business may require that we lay off employees with possible negative effects on employee morale. We try to minimize these risks by actively promoting employee relationships and offering competitive salaries, but if we cannot mitigate these risks, our business and our operating performance could be adversely affected. We compete in highly competitive markets . The markets for our services are highly competitive. Some of our competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, human, technical and other resources and greater name recognition than we do. If we fail to be competitive with these companies in the future, we may lose market share, which could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. There are relatively few barriers preventing companies from entering the markets in which we operate. As a result, new market entrants also pose a threat to our business. We also compete with in-house personnel at current and prospective clients, who may attempt to duplicate our services using their own personnel. If we are not able to compete effectively, our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected. We operate from multiple locations and our employees are very diverse, so we have significant coordination risks. We are headquartered in Ridgefield Park, New Jersey, just outside New York City, and our Agility business is headquartered in Ottawa, Canada and has an additional location in London, the United Kingdom. We have ten delivery centers in the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka, Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom and Israel . Our employees are geographically dispersed, as well as culturally diverse. Our personnel need to work together to successfully execute our business plans and we invest in various measures to improve coordination and teamwork. Should we fail in these efforts, our ability to execute our business plans may be adversely affected. Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and if we are unable to protect them or are subject to intellectual property rights claims, our business may be harmed. Our intellectual property rights include certain trademarks, trade secrets, domain name registrations, a patent and patent applications. Although we take precautions to protect our intellectual property rights, these efforts may not be sufficient or effective. In addition, various events outside of our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights, as well as to our business. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, we may experience difficulties in achieving and maintaining brand recognition. Disruptions in telecommunications, system failures, data corruption or virus attacks could harm our ability to execute our global resource model, which could result in client dissatisfaction and a reduction of our revenues. We use a distributed global resource model. Our North American workforce provides services from our U.S. and Canada offices, as well as from client sites; and our other international workforce provides services from our ten offshore delivery centers in the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka, Germany, the United Kingdom and Israel . Our global facilities are linked with a telecommunications network that uses multiple service providers. We may not be able to maintain active voice and data communications between our various facilities and our clients' sites at all times due to disruptions in these networks, system failures, data corruption or virus attacks. Any significant failure in our ability to communicate, or the availability of our platforms, could result in a disruption in our business, which could hinder our performance, or our ability to complete client projects on time, or provide services to our clients. This, in turn, could lead to client dissatisfaction and an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. A material breach in security relating to our information systems could adversely affect us. Even though we have implemented network security measures, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to computer viruses, cyber-attacks, break-ins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering or intentional and unintentional disclosure of sensitive and /or confidential personal information by employees and non-employees. Additionally, the Company may not be able to effectively identify and resolve such issues on a timely basis. The occurrence of any of the events described above could result in interruptions, delays, the loss or corruption of data, cessations in the availability of systems or liability under privacy laws or contracts, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations . Governmental and client focus on data security could increase our costs of operations. In addition, any incident in which we fail to protect our client’s information against security breaches may result in monetary damages against us, and termination of our engagement by our client, and may adversely impact our results of operations. Certain laws and regulations regarding data privacy and security affecting our clients impose requirements regarding the privacy and security of information maintained by these clients, as well as notification to persons whose personal information is accessed by an unauthorized third party. As a result of any continuing legislative initiatives and client demands, we may have to modify our operations with the goal of further improving data security. The cost of compliance with these laws and regulations is high and is likely to increase in the future. Any such modifications may result in increased expenses and operating complexity, and we may be unable to increase the rates we charge for our services sufficiently to offset these increases. In addition, as part of the services we perform, we have access to confidential client data, including sensitive personal data. As a result, we are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect this information. We may also be bound by certain client agreements to use and disclose the confidential client information in a manner consistent with the privacy standards under regulations applicable to such client. Any failure on our part to comply with these laws and regulations can result in negative publicity and diversion of management’s time and effort and may subject us to significant liabilities and other penalties. If client confidential information is inappropriately disclosed due to a breach of our computer systems, system failures or otherwise, or if any person, including any of our employees, negligently disregards or intentionally breaches controls or procedures with which we are responsible for complying with respect to such data or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data, we may have substantial liabilities to our clients. Any incidents with respect to the handling of such information could subject us to litigation or indemnification claims with our clients and other parties. In addition, any breach or alleged breach of our confidentiality agreements with our clients may result in termination of their engagements, resulting in associated loss of revenue and increased costs. Our international operations subject us to risks inherent in doing business on an international level, any of which could increase our costs and hinder our growth. The major part of our operations is carried on in the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka, Israel, the United Kingdom, Canada and Germany, while our headquarters are in the U.S., and our clients are primarily located in North America and Europe. While we do not depend on significant revenues from sources internal to the Asian countries in which we operate, we are nevertheless subject to certain adverse economic factors relating to overseas economies generally, including inflation, external debt, a negative balance of trade and underemployment. In certain of the countries in which we operate tax authorities have exercised, and may continue to exercise, significant discretionary and arbitrary powers to make tax demands or decline to refund payments that may be due to us as per tax returns. Other risks associated with our international business activities include: One or more of these factors could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our international business is subject to applicable laws and regulations relating to foreign corrupt practices, the violation of which could adversely affect our operations. We must comply with all applicable anti-bribery laws and regulations of the U.S. and other jurisdictions where we operate. For example, we are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010 relating to corrupt and illegal payments to government officials and others. Although we have policies and controls in place that are designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, it is possible that an employee or an agent acting on our behalf could fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, and due to the complex nature of the risks, it may not always be possible for us to ascertain compliance with such laws and regulations. In such event, we could be exposed to civil penalties, criminal penalties and other sanctions, including fines or other unintended punitive actions, and we could incur substantial legal fees and related expenses. In addition, such violations could damage our business and/or our reputation. All of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. Our international operations subject us to currency exchange fluctuations, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Although most of our revenues are denominated in U.S. dollars, a significant portion of our revenues are denominated in Canadian dollars, Pound Sterling and Euros. In addition, a significant portion of our expenses, primarily labor expenses in the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka, Germany, Canada, the United Kingdom and Israel, are incurred in the local currencies of the countries in which we operate. For financial reporting purposes, we translate all non-U.S. denominated transactions into U.S. dollars in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP). Fluctuations in the value of these currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could have a direct impact on our revenues and our results of operations. The Philippines and India have, at times, experienced high rates of inflation, as well as major fluctuations in the exchange rate between the Philippine peso and the U.S. dollar and the Indian rupee and the U.S. dollar. Although we selectively undertake hedging activities to mitigate certain of these risks, our hedging activities may not be effective and may result in losses. As of December 31, 2019, the aggregate notional amount of our hedges against the Indian rupee was approximately $4.3 million and we had no hedges against the Philippine peso . Fluctuations in exchange rates also affect the value of funds held by our foreign subsidiaries. We do not currently intend to hedge these assets. In the event that the governments of India or the Philippines or the government of another country changes its tax policies, rules and regulations, our tax expense may increase and affect our effective tax rates. We are subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. We are subject to the continual examination by tax authorities in India and in the Philippines, and the Company assesses the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits could be materially different from what is reflected in historical income tax and indirect tax provisions and accruals, and could result in a material effect on the Company’s income tax provision, indirect tax expenses, net income or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made. If additional taxes are assessed, it could have an adverse impact on our financial results. In addition, changes in the tax rates, tax laws or the interpretation of tax laws in the jurisdictions where we operate, could affect our future results of operations. In September 2015, the Company’s Indian subsidiary was subject to an inquiry by the Service Tax Department in India regarding the classification of services provided by this subsidiary, asserting that the services provided by this subsidiary fall under the category of online information and database access or retrieval services (OID Services), and not under the category of business support services (BS Services) that are exempt from service tax as historically indicated in the subsidiary’s service tax filings. Our management disagrees with the Service Tax Department’s position. In November 2019, the Commissioner of Central Tax, GST & Central Excise issued an order confirming the Service Tax Department’s position. The Company is contesting this order in an appeal to the Customs, Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal. In the event the Service Tax Department is ultimately successful in proving that the services fall under the category of OID Services, the revenues earned by the Company’s Indian subsidiary for the period July 2012 through November 2016 would be subject to a service tax of between 12.36% and 15%, and this subsidiary may also be liable to pay interest and penalties. The revenue of our Indian subsidiary during this period was approximately $66.0 million. In accordance with new rules promulgated by the Service Tax Department, as of December 1, 2016 service tax is no longer applicable to OID or BS Services. Based on the assessment of the Company’s counsel, the Company has not recorded any tax liability for this case. In a separate action relating to service tax refunds, in October 2016, the Company’s Indian subsidiary received notices from the Indian Service Tax Department in India seeking to reverse service tax refunds of approximately $160,000 previously granted to our Indian subsidiary for three quarters in 2014, asserting that the services provided by this subsidiary fall under the category of OID Services and not BS Services. The appeal was determined in favor of the Service Tax Department. Management disagrees with the basis of this decision and is contesting it. The Company expects delays in its Indian subsidiary receiving further service tax refunds until this matter is adjudicated with finality, and currently has service tax credits of approximately $1.0 million recorded as a receivable. Based on the assessment of the Company’s counsel, the Company has not recorded any tax liability for this case. Substantial recovery against us in the above referenced 2015 Service Tax Department case could have a material adverse impact on us, and unfavorable rulings or recoveries in other tax proceedings could have a material impact on the consolidated operating results of the period in which the rulings or recovery occurs. If tax authorities in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate contest the manner in which we allocate our profits, our net loss could be higher. A significant portion of the services we provide to our clients are provided by our Asian subsidiaries located in different jurisdictions. Tax authorities in some of these jurisdictions have from time to time challenged the manner in which we allocate our profits among our subsidiaries, and we may not prevail in any future challenge of this type. If such a challenge were successful, our worldwide effective tax rate could increase, thereby increasing our net loss. An expiration or termination of our preferential tax rate incentives could adversely affect our results of operations. Two of our foreign subsidiaries are subject to preferential tax rates. This tax incentive provides that we pay reduced income taxes with respect to those jurisdictions for a fixed period of time. An expiration or termination of these incentives could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, or increase our tax expense, thereby decreasing our net income and adversely affecting our results of operations. Our earnings may be adversely affected if we change our intent not to repatriate our foreign earnings and profits or if such earnings and profits become subject to U.S. tax on a current basis. In December 2017, the President signed the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (2017 Tax Act), which includes a broad range of provisions, many of which significantly differ from those contained in previous U.S. tax law. One such provision relates to a one-time tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of post-1986 untaxed foreign earnings and profits (E&P), referred to as the toll charge. A significant portion of our operations are conducted outside the U.S. Despite our access to the overseas earnings and the resulting toll charge, we intend to indefinitely reinvest the foreign earnings in our foreign subsidiaries on account of the foreign jurisdiction withholding tax that the Company has to incur on the actual remittances. Unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries amounted to approximately $25.7 million at December 31, 2019. If such earnings are repatriated in the future, or are no longer deemed to be indefinitely reinvested, the Company would have to accrue as a liability the applicable amount of foreign jurisdiction withholding taxes associated with such remittances. Anti-outsourcing legislation, if adopted, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and impair our ability to service our clients. The issue of outsourcing of services abroad by U.S. companies is a topic of political discussion in the U.S. Measures aimed at limiting or restricting outsourcing by U.S. companies are under discussion in Congress and in numerous state legislatures. While no substantive anti-outsourcing legislation has been introduced to date, given the ongoing debate over this issue, the introduction of such legislation is possible. If introduced, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected and our ability to service our clients could be impaired. Our growth could be hindered by visa restrictions. Occasionally, we have employees from our other facilities visit or transfer to the U.S. to meet our clients or work on projects at a client’s site. Any visa restrictions or new legislation putting a restriction on issuing visas could affect our business. Immigration and visa laws and regulations in the U.S. and other countries are subject to legislative and administrative changes, as well as changes in the application of standards. Immigration and visa laws and regulations can be significantly affected by political forces and levels of economic activity. Our international expansion strategy and our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected if legislative or administrative changes to immigration or visa laws and regulations impair our ability to staff projects with our professionals who are not citizens of the country where the work is to be performed. Political uncertainty, political unrest, terrorism, and natural calamities in the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka and Israel could adversely affect business conditions in those regions, which in turn could disrupt our business and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. The majority of our delivery centers are located in the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka and Israel. These countries and regions remain vulnerable to disruptions from political uncertainty, political unrest, terrorist acts, and natural calamities. Any damage to our network and/or information systems would damage our ability to provide services, in whole or in part, and/or otherwise damage our operations and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Further, political tensions and escalation of hostilities in any of these countries could adversely affect our operations in these countries and therefore adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. Our global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises. We use a distributed global resource model, which exposes us to risks associated with public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics. A public health crisis in the geographic areas in which we operate could affect our ability to provide services to our clients and adversely affect our results of operations. We are actively monitoring the recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus COVID - 19 and its potential impact on our operations. While we do not expect that the virus will have a material adverse effect on our business or financial results at this time, we are unable to accurately predict the impact that the coronavirus will have due to various uncertainties, including the ultimate geographic spread of the virus, the severity of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, and actions that may be taken by governmental authorities. Terrorist attacks or a war could adversely affect our results of operations. Terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war could affect us or our clients by disrupting normal business practices for extended periods of time and reducing business confidence. In addition, acts of violence or war may make travel more difficult and may effectively curtail our ability to serve our clients' needs, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations. We may face various risks associated with shareholder activists or shareholder demands for better performance . There is no assurance that we will not be subject to shareholder activism or demands. Such activities could interfere with our ability to execute our strategic plan, be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations, and divert the attention of management and our employees. We are the subject of continuing litigation, including litigation by certain of our former employees. In 2008, a judgment was rendered in the Philippines against a Philippine subsidiary of the Company that is no longer active and purportedly also against Innodata Inc., in favor of certain former employees of the Philippine subsidiary. The potential payment amount aggregates to approximately $6.4 million, plus legal interest that accrued at 12% per annum from August 13, 2008 to June 30, 2013, and thereafter accrued and continues to accrue at 6% per annum. The potential payment amount as expressed in U.S. dollars varies with the Philippine peso to U.S. dollar exchange rate. In December 2017, a group of 97 of the former employees of the Philippine subsidiary indicated that they proposed to record the judgment as to themselves in New Jersey. In January 2018, in response to an action initiated by Innodata Inc., the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey (USDC) entered a preliminary injunction that enjoins these former employees from pursuing or seeking recognition or enforcement of the judgment against Innodata Inc. in the U.S. during the pendency of the action and until further order of the USDC. In June 2018, the USDC entered a consent order administratively closing the action subject to return of the action to the active docket upon the written request of Innodata Inc. or the former employees, with the USDC retaining jurisdiction over the matter and the preliminary injunction remaining in full force and effect. The principal relevant cases in the Philippines are Court of Appeals Case Nos. CA-G.R. SP No. 93295 Innodata Employees Association (IDEA), Eleanor Tolentino, et al. vs. Innodata Philippines, Inc., et al., and CA-G.R. SP No. 90538 Innodata Philippines, Inc. vs. Honorable Acting Secretary Manuel G. Imson, et al. (28 June 2007), the Department of Labor and Employment National Labor Relations Commission, Republic of the Philippines (NLRC-NCR-Case No.07-04713-2002, et al., Innodata Employees Association (IDEA) and Eleanor A. Tolentino, et al. vs. Innodata Philippines, Inc., et al), and the Department of Labor and Employment Office of the Secretary of Labor and Employment, Republic of the Philippines (Case No. OS-AJ-0015-2001, In Re: Labor Dispute at Innodata Philippines, Inc.). The U.S. District Court action is Civil Action No.: 2:17-cv-13268-SDW-LDW Innodata Inc. v. Myrna C. Augustin-Simon; et al. We are also subject to various other legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. While we believe that we have adequate reserves for those losses that we believe are probable and can be reasonably estimated, the ultimate results of legal proceedings and claims cannot be predicted with certainty. While we currently believe that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or overall trends in our consolidated results of operations, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties. Substantial recovery against us in the above- referenced Philippines action could have a material adverse impact on us, and unfavorable rulings or recoveries in the other proceedings could have a material adverse impact on the consolidated operating results of the period in which the ruling or recovery occurs. In addition, our estimate of potential impact on our consolidated financial position or overall consolidated results of operations for the above referenced legal proceedings could change in the future. See “Legal Proceedings.” Our reputation could be damaged, or our profitability could suffer if we do not meet the controls and procedures in respect of the services and solutions we provide to our clients, or if we contribute to our clients’ internal control deficiencies. Our clients may perform audits or require us to perform audits, provide audit reports or obtain certifications with respect to the controls and procedures that we use in the performance of services for such clients, especially when we process data or information belonging to them. Our ability to acquire new clients and retain existing clients may be adversely affected and our reputation could be harmed if we receive a qualified opinion, or if we cannot obtain an appropriate certification or opinion with respect to our controls and procedures in connection with any such audit in a timely manner. Additionally, our profitability could suffer if our controls and procedures were to fail or to impair our client’s ability to comply with its own internal control requirements. New and changing corporate governance and public disclosure requirements add uncertainty to our compliance policies and increase our costs of compliance. Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to accounting, corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, other SEC regulations, and the Nasdaq Stock Market rules, create uncertainty for companies like ours. These laws, regulations and standards may lack specificity and are subject to varying interpretations. Their application in practice may evolve over time, as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs of compliance as a result of revisions to such corporate governance standards. Although we are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure, and complying with evolving laws, regulations and standards, if we fail to comply with new or changed laws, regulations or standards of corporate governance, our business and reputation may be harmed. We had a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 and cannot assure you that additional material weaknesses will not be identified in the future. Our efforts to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related regulations regarding our required assessment of our internal control over financial reporting requires the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources. We regularly assess the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, remediate any control deficiencies that may be identified, and validate through testing that our controls are functioning as documented. We identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 in accounting for foreign currency remeasurement and liabilities. We implemented further enhancements to our internal controls to prevent and detect such errors from occurring in the future. Our failure to successfully remediate a material weakness could result in adverse consequences to us, including, but not limited to, a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could cause the market price of our stock to decline. It is unlikely that we will pay dividends. We have not paid any cash dividends since our inception and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We expect that our earnings, if any, will be used to finance our growth. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. None. Item 2. Properties. Our services are primarily performed from our Ridgefield, New Jersey headquarters and ten overseas delivery centers in the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka, Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom and Israel, all of which are leased. The square footage of all our leased properties totals approximately 318,000. Our leased properties in the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Germany and Israel are primarily used by our DDS segment; our leased property in India is primarily used by our DDS and Synodex segments; and our leased properties in Canada and the United Kingdom are primarily used by our Agility segment. Our leased property in the United States is our corporate headquarters and is used by all segments. In addition, we may need to lease additional property in the future. We believe that we will be able to obtain suitable additional facilities on commercially reasonable terms on an “as needed” basis. Item 3. Legal Proceedings. In 2008, a judgment was rendered in the Philippines against a Philippine subsidiary of the Company that is no longer active and purportedly also against Innodata Inc., in favor of certain former employees of the Philippine subsidiary. The potential payment amount aggregates approximately $6.4 million, plus legal interest that accrued at 12% per annum from August 13, 2008 to June 30, 2013, and thereafter accrued and continues to accrue at 6% per annum. The potential payment amount as expressed in U.S. dollars varies with the Philippine peso to U.S. dollar exchange rate. In December 2017, a group of 97 of the former employees of the Philippine subsidiary indicated that they proposed to record the judgment as to themselves in New Jersey. In January 2018, in response to an action initiated by Innodata Inc., the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey (USDC) entered a preliminary injunction that enjoins these former employees from pursuing or seeking recognition or enforcement of the judgment against Innodata Inc. in the U.S. during the pendency of the action and until further order of the USDC. In June 2018, the USDC entered a consent order administratively closing the action subject to return of the action to the active docket upon the written request of Innodata Inc. or the former employees, with the USDC retaining jurisdiction over the matter and the preliminary injunction remaining in full force and effect. The principal relevant cases in the Philippines are Court of Appeals Case Nos. CA-G.R. SP No. 93295 Innodata Employees Association (IDEA), Eleanor Tolentino, et al. vs. Innodata Philippines, Inc., et al., and CA-G.R. SP No. 90538 Innodata Philippines, Inc. vs. Honorable Acting Secretary Manuel G. Imson, et al. (28 June 2007), the Department of Labor and Employment National Labor Relations Commission, Republic of the Philippines (NLRC-NCR-Case No.07-04713-2002, et al., Innodata Employees Association (IDEA) and Eleanor A. Tolentino, et al. vs. Innodata Philippines, Inc., et al), and the Department of Labor and Employment Office of the Secretary of Labor and Employment, Republic of the Philippines (Case No. OS-AJ-0015-2001, In Re: Labor Dispute at Innodata Philippines, Inc.). The U.S. District Court action is Civil Action No.: 2:17-cv-13268-SDW-LDW Innodata Inc. v. Myrna C. Augustin-Simon; et al. We are also subject to various other legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. While we believe that we have adequate reserves for those losses that we believe are probable and can be reasonably estimated, the ultimate results of legal proceedings and claims cannot be predicted with certainty. While management currently believes that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or overall trends in our consolidated results of operations, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties. Substantial recovery against us in the above referenced Philippines action could have a material adverse impact on us, and unfavorable rulings or recoveries in the other proceedings could have a material adverse impact on the consolidated operating results of the period in which the ruling or recovery occurs. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures. Not applicable. PART II Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities. Innodata Inc. (the “Company”) Common Stock is quoted on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC under the symbol “INOD.” On February 19, 2020, there were 69 stockholders of record of the Company’s Common Stock based on information provided by the Company's transfer agent. Virtually all of the Company’s publicly held shares are held in “street name” and the Company believes the actual number of beneficial holders of its Common Stock to be 2,689. We did not have any sales of unregistered equity securities during the year ended December 31, 2019. We do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future. Securities Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans The following table sets forth the aggregate information for the Company's equity compensation plans in effect as of December 31, 2019: (1) 2013 Stock Plan, approved by the stockholders, see Note 9 to Consolidated Financial Statements, contained elsewhere herein. Purchase of Equity Securities In July 2019, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2.0 million of its issued and outstanding common stock in open market or privately negotiated transactions.

Selected Financial Data. Not applicable to smaller reporting companies. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report which are hereby incorporated by reference. In addition to historical information, this discussion includes forward-looking information that involves risks and assumptions based upon management’s current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from the results referred to in forward-looking statements. See “Forward-Looking Statements” included elsewhere in this report. Correction of Errors In the quarter ended December 31, 2019, we identified and corrected an error in our accounting for foreign currency remeasurement of refundable taxes in our Indian subsidiary under ASC 830 Foreign Currency Matters. We also identified and corrected an overstatement of two long-standing accruals that we deemed to be no longer necessary. Due to these errors, our direct operating costs were understated, our refundable tax was overstated, and our liabilities were overstated as of December 31, 2018. We assessed the materiality of these errors in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 99, Materiality, and determined that the errors were immaterial to each of the previously reported periods. To correct this error, we have restated our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2018, and Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss, Consolidated Statement of Stockholders’ Equity and Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2018. See Note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for further information, as well as reconciliations of the effects of the restatement on our financial statements for the period indicated. Executive Overview We are a global data engineering company. We operate in three reporting segments: Digital Data Solutions (DDS), Synodex and Agility. The following table sets forth certain financial data for the two years ended December 31, 2019: Adjusted EBITDA In addition to measures of financial performance presented in our consolidated financial statements, we monitor “Adjusted EBITDA” to help us evaluate our ongoing operating performance including our ability to operate the business effectively. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) attributable to Innodata Inc. and its subsidiaries in accordance with U.S. GAAP before income taxes, depreciation and amortization of intangible assets, impairment charges, stock-based compensation, and loss attributable to non-controlling interests and interest income (expense). We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful to our management and investors in evaluating our operating performance and for operational decision-making purposes. In particular, Adjusted EBITDA facilitates period-to-period comparisons of our operating results on a consistent basis by excluding items that are not reflective of our core operations or are not within our control and helps us identify underlying trends in our business. In this regard, we believe it provides useful information about our operating results, enhances the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects and allows for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by the management in our operational decision-making. We also use this measure to establish operational goals for managing our business and evaluating our performance. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are: Adjusted EBITDA should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, U.S. GAAP net income (loss). The following tables reconcile net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA (loss) for the periods presented (in thousands): Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2018 Revenues Total r evenues were $55.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a 3% decrease from $57.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Revenues from the DDS segment were $41.3 million and $43.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, a decline of $2.2 million or approximately 5%. The decline was due to lower revenue from the top two clients of DDS. Revenues from the Synodex segment were $3.9 million and $4.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, a decrease of $0.2 million or approximately 5%. The decrease was primarily due to reduction in volume from two existing clients partially offset by an increase in volume from one existing client and volume from a new client. Revenues from the Agility segment were $10.7 million and $9.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, an increase of $0.9 million or approximately 9%. The increase was attributable to higher revenues from subscriptions to our Agility media database. Two clients in the DDS segment generated approximately 26% and 30% of the Company’s total revenues in the fiscal years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. No other client accounted for 10% or more of total revenues during these periods. Further, in the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, revenues from non-U.S. clients accounted for 55% and 56% of the Company's revenues, respectively. Direct Operating Costs Direct operating costs consist of direct payroll, occupancy costs, data center hosting fees, content acquisition costs, depreciation and amortization, travel, telecommunications, computer services and supplies, realized gain (loss) on forward contracts, foreign currency remeasurement gain (loss), and other direct expenses that are incurred in providing services to our clients. Direct operating costs were approximately $37.3 million and $39.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, a decrease of $2.0 million or approximately 5%. Direct operating costs for the DDS segment were $27.5 million and $30.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, a decrease of $2.5 million or approximately 8%. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in direct operating costs of $2.9 million as part of our continuing cost rationalization initiatives, offset in part by a one-time charge of $0.4 million for an assessment of retroactive foreign social security contributions as a result of a decision by the Supreme Court of India that affects companies generally. The reduction of $2.9 million in direct operating costs was primarily a result of lower compensation related costs of $1.5 million, lower occupancy costs, travel, professional fees and others of $0.7 million and foreign exchange loss and lower depreciation and amortization of $0.7 million. Direct operating costs for the DDS segment as a percentage of DDS segment revenues were 67% and 69% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Direct operating costs for the Synodex segment were approximately $3.2 million and $3.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, net of intersegment profit, an increase of $0.2 million or 7%. The increase was due to the cost of hardware and software upgrades expensed during the year. Direct operating costs for the Synodex segment as a percentage of Synodex segment revenues were 82% and 73% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in direct operating costs as a percentage of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to lower revenue from two clients partially offset by an increase in volume from one existing client, volume from a new client and an increase in the cost of hardware and software upgrades expensed during the year. Direct operating costs for the Agility segment were approximately $6.6 million and $6.3 million, net of intersegment profit, for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The $0.3 million increase was primarily a result of expenditures in support of increased revenues. Direct operating costs for the Agility segment as a percentage of Agility segment revenues were 62% and 64% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Selling and Administrative Expenses Selling and administrative expenses consist of management and administrative salaries, sales and marketing costs including commissions, new services research and related software development, third-party software, advertising and trade conferences, professional fees and consultant costs, and other administrative overhead costs. Selling and administrative expenses were $19.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $15.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $3.2 million or 20%. This increase was primarily a result of investments in strategic initiatives designed to expand our addressable market and compensation related expenses in the DDS segment. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues were 34% and 28% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Selling and administrative expenses for the DDS segment were $12.7 million and $9.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, an increase of $3.3 million or 35%. This increase is a result of investments in strategic initiatives designed to expand our addressable market. The savings realized from our cost rationalization initiatives were channeled into our strategic initiatives. The increase in selling and administrative expenses for the DDS segment were primarily due to higher compensation related costs of $2.3 million, recruitment and professional fees of $0.8 million, and other selling and marketing costs of $0.2 million. As a percentage of DDS revenues, DDS selling and administrative expenses were 31% and 22% for each of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively . The increase in selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues was due to lower revenues combined with increased selling and administrative expenses . Selling and administrative expenses for the Synodex segment was $0.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Selling and administrative expenses for the Synodex segment as a percentage of Synodex segment revenues were 18% and 17% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Selling and administrative expenses for the Agility segment were $5.7 million and $5.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, a decrease of $0.1 million or 2%. The decrease was primarily due to compensation related expenses. Selling and administrative expenses for the Agility segment as a percentage of Agility segment revenues were 53% and 59% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Goodwill Impairment We performed our annual goodwill assessment for the Agility segment as of September 30, 2019. In performing the assessment, we adhered to the provisions of ASU 2017-04, by using a single step approach that determines the carrying value of goodwill and comparing it against the excess of the reporting unit’s fair value. Based on our assessment, we reached the conclusion that there was no goodwill impairment because the fair value of the Agility segment’s goodwill exceeded its carrying value. Therefore, there was no goodwill impairment recorded during the year ended December 31, 2019. We performed an assessment as of June 30, 2018 and determined that the fair value of the Agility segment exceeded its carrying value, but the fair value of the DDS segment was below its carrying value. As a result, we recorded a full goodwill impairment of $675,000 for the DDS segment reporting unit for the year ended December 31, 2018. Taxes We recorded a provision for income taxes of approximately $1.1 million and $1.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Tax-related charges primarily consisted of a provision for foreign taxes recorded in accordance with the local tax regulations by our foreign subsidiaries. Effective income tax rates are disproportionate primarily due to the valuation allowance recorded on the deferred taxes on the U.S. and Canadian entities. See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Footnote 3. “Taxes” for additional information. The reconciliation of the U.S. statutory rate with the Company’s effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 are summarized in the table below: Despite access to overseas earnings and the resulting toll charge, we intend to indefinitely reinvest earnings and profits in our foreign subsidiaries on account of the foreign jurisdiction withholding taxes that we would have to incur on the actual remittances. Unremitted foreign earnings and profits amounted to approximately $25.7 million at December 31, 2019. If such foreign earnings and profits are repatriated in the future, or are no longer deemed to be indefinitely reinvested, we would have to accrue the applicable amount of foreign jurisdiction withholding taxes associated with such remittances. We have a valuation allowance on all of our U.S. deferred tax assets on account of continuing losses incurred by our U.S. entity. In addition, we also have a valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets of our Canadian subsidiaries. Our Canadian subsidiaries also have research and development credits available to reduce taxable income in future years, which may be carried forward indefinitely. The potential benefits from these balances have not been recognized for financial statement purposes. Tax Assessments In September 2015, our Indian subsidiary was subject to an inquiry by the Service Tax Department in India regarding the classification of services provided by this subsidiary, asserting that the services provided by this subsidiary fall under the category of online information and database access or retrieval services (OID Services), and not under the category of business support services (BS Services) that are exempt from service tax as historically indicated in the subsidiary’s service tax filings. We disagree with the Service Tax Department’s position. In November 2019, the Commissioner of Central Tax, GST & Central Excise issued an order confirming the Service Tax Department’s position. We are vigorously contesting this order in an appeal to the Customs, Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal . In the event the Service Tax Department is ultimately successful in proving that the services fall under the category of OID Services, the revenues earned by our Indian subsidiary for the period July 2012 through November 2016 would be subject to a service tax of between 12.36% and 15%, and this subsidiary may also be liable to pay interest and penalties . The revenue of our Indian subsidiary during this period was approximately $66.0 million. In accordance with new rules promulgated by the Service Tax Department, as of December 1, 2016 service tax is no longer applicable to OID or BS Services. Based on our counsel’s assessment, we have not recorded any tax liability for this case. In a separate action relating to service tax refunds, in October 2016, our Indian subsidiary received notices from the Indian Service Tax Department in India seeking to reverse service tax refunds of approximately $160,000 previously granted to our Indian subsidiary for three quarters in 2014, asserting that the services provided by this subsidiary fall under the category of OID Services and not BS Services. The appeal was determined in favor of the Service Tax Department. We disagree with the basis of this decision and are contesting it vigorously. We expect delays in our Indian subsidiary receiving further service tax refunds until this matter is adjudicated with finality, and currently have service tax credits of approximately $1.0 million recorded as a receivable. Based on our counsel’s assessment, we have not recorded any tax liability for this case. Net Loss We had a net loss of $1.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to a net loss of $0.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2019 included a one-time charge of $400,000 for an assessment of retroactive foreign social security contributions as a result of a decision by the Supreme Court of India that affects companies generally. The DDS segment was breakeven for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to a net income of $1.6 million for the year ended December 31 , 2018, net of intersegment profits. The decrease in net income of $1.6 million was attributable to lower revenues of $2.2 million, higher operating expenses of $0.8 million, a decrease in tax provisions of $0.7 million, and a decrease in goodwill impairment of $0.7 million. Net income for the Synodex segment was breakeven for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to net income of $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 , net of intersegment profits. The decrease was primarily due to revenue timing from one client partially offset by an increase in volume from one existing client, volume from a new client and an increase in the cost of hardware and software upgrades expensed during the year. Net loss for the Agility segment was $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to a net loss of $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The $0.7 million improvement was the result of higher revenues offset in part by increased expenditures to support revenue growth. Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $3.3 million compared to an Adjusted EBITDA of $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a decrease of $3.1 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the DDS segment was $3.2 million and $6.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, a decrease of $3.5 million or approximately 52%. The decrease was primarily attributable to a higher net loss of $1.6 million, a lower tax provision of $0.7 million, lower depreciation and amortization of $0.5 million and $0.7 million of goodwill impairment for the year ended December 31, 2018. Adjusted EBITDA for the Synodex segment was $0.1 million and $0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, a decrease of $0.3 million. The decrease was primarily due to revenue timing from one client partially offset by an increase in volume from one existing client and volume from a new client and an increase in the cost of hardware and software upgrades expensed during the year. Adjusted EBITDA in the Agility segment was breakeven for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to an Adjusted EBITDA loss of $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an improvement of $0.7 million. The improvement was due to higher revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019. Liquidity and Capital Resources Selected measures of liquidity and capital resources, expressed in thousands, are as follows: At December 31, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $10.9 million, of which $4.8 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries, and $6.1 million was held in the United States. Despite the passage of the new tax law under which we may repatriate funds from overseas after paying the toll charge, it is our intent as of December 31, 2019, to permanently reinvest the overseas funds in our foreign subsidiaries on account of the withholding tax that we would have to incur on the actual remittances. We have used, and plan to use, our cash and cash equivalents for (i) investments in the Agility segment; (ii) the expansion of our other operations; (iii) technology innovation; (iv) product management and strategic marketing; (v) general corporate purposes, including working capital; and (vi) possible business acquisitions. As of December 31, 2019, we had working capital of approximately $8.8 million, as compared to working capital of approximately $12.3 million as of December 31, 2018. We did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures as of December 31, 2019. During 2019, we re-purchased 1,503,095 shares of our common stock at a volume-weighted average price of $1.23 per share, for a total cost of $1.8 million. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and internally generated funds will provide sufficient sources of liquidity to satisfy our financial needs for the next 12 months from the date of issuance of these financial statements. However, we have no bank facilities or lines of credit, reductions in our cash and cash equivalents from operating losses, capital expenditures, adverse legal decisions, acquisitions or otherwise that could materially and adversely affect the Company. Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Cash provided by our operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $4.9 million and was the result of the net loss of $1.6 million, the effect of adjustments for non-cash items of $3.8 million and sources of working capital of $2.7 million. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of $2.9 million for depreciation and amortization, stock option expense of $0.8 million and $0.1 million for other non-cash items. Working capital activities primarily consisted of sources from a $1.2 million decrease in our accounts receivable, a $1.1 million decrease in prepaid and other current assets, and a $0.9 million increase in income and other taxes which was offset in part by a use of $0.5 million due to an increase in other working capital. The reduction in accounts receivable is a result of higher collections during the year ended December 31, 2019. Refer to the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for further details. Cash provided by our operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $3.6 million, resulting from a net loss of $0.3 million and adjustments for non-cash items of $5.5 million and uses of working capital of $1.6 million. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of $3.4 million for depreciation and amortization, stock option expense of $0.8 million, goodwill impairment of $0.7 million, pension cost of $0.4 million and deferred tax provisions of $0.2 million. Working capital activities primarily consisted of a use of cash of $1.0 million due to a decrease in accrued salaries, wages and related benefits, $0.8 million due to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses offset by a source of $0.2 million due to an increase in other working capital accounts. Our days’ sales outstanding were 66 days at both December 31, 2019 and 2018. We calculate DSO by first dividing the total revenues for the period by average net accounts receivable, which is the sum of net accounts receivable at the beginning of the period and net accounts receivable at the end of the period, to yield an amount we refer to as the “accounts receivable turnover”. Then we divide the total number of days within the period reported by the accounts receivable turnover to yield DSO expressed in number of days. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities Cash used in our investing activities was $1.8 million and $2.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These capital expenditures were principally for the purchase of technology equipment including servers, network infrastructure and workstations, and expenditures for internally developed software. Capital expenditures of $1.8 million consisted of $0.2 million for the DDS segment and $1.6 million for the Agility segment. For the year 2020, we anticipate that capital expenditures for ongoing technology, equipment and infrastructure upgrades will approximate $2.0 to $2.3 million, a portion of which we may finance. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities was $1.8 million for the repurchase of 1,503,095 shares of our common stock at a volume-weighted average price of $1.23 per share. The repurchases were made under the 2019 authorization approved by the Board of Directors. Payments of long-term obligations approximated $1.0 million and $2.0 million for 2019 and 2018, respectively. Inflation, Seasonality and Prevailing Economic Conditions Although most of our revenues are denominated in U.S. dollars, a significant portion of our revenues is denominated in Canadian dollars, Pound Sterling and Euros. In addition, a significant portion of our expenses, primarily labor expenses in the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka, Germany, Canada and Israel, is incurred in the local currencies of the countries in which we operate. For financial reporting purposes, we translate all non-U.S. denominated transactions into U.S. dollars in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Thus, we are exposed to the risk that fluctuations in the value of these currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could have a direct impact on our revenues and our results of operations. The Philippines and India have at times experienced high rates of inflation as well as major fluctuations in the exchange rate between the Philippine peso and the U.S. dollar and the Indian rupee and the U.S. dollar. As of December 31, 2019, the aggregate notional amount of our hedges against the Indian rupee was approximately $4.3 million , and we had no hedges against the Philippine peso . Fluctuations in exchange rates also affect the value of funds held by our foreign subsidiaries. We do not currently intend to hedge these assets. Our most significant costs are the salaries and related benefits of our employees in Asia. We are exposed to high inflation in wage rates in the countries in which we operate. We generally perform work for our clients under project-specific contracts, requirements-based contracts or long-term contracts. We must adequately anticipate wage increases, particularly on our fixed-price contracts. There can be no assurance that we will be able to recover cost increases through increases in the prices that we charge for our services to our clients. Our quarterly operating results are subject to certain fluctuations. We experience fluctuations in our revenue and earnings as we replace and begin new projects, which may have some normal start-up delays, or we may be unable to replace a project entirely. These and other factors may contribute to fluctuations in our operating results from quarter to quarter. In addition, as some of our Asian facilities are closed during holidays in the fourth quarter, we typically incur higher wages, due to overtime, that reduce our margins. Our Synodex subsidiary experiences seasonal fluctuations in revenues. Typically, revenue is lowest in the third quarter of the calendar year and highest in the fourth quarter of the calendar year. The seasonality is directly linked to the number of life insurance applications received by the insurance companies. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Not applicable to smaller reporting companies. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. See Financial Statement Index and Financial Statements commencing on page F-1, which are incorporated by reference herein. Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure. None. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Under the supervision, and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), as of December 31, 2019. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2019, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and disposition of assets; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of company assets are made in accordance with management and director authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected. Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on the framework set forth in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on its evaluation under this framework, Management identified the following material weaknesses and concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2019. 1. Lack of review procedures related to changes in events concerning the designation of an asset from non-monetary to monetary, resulting in the improper remeasurement and classification of foreign currency affecting refundable income tax as defined in ASC 830, Foreign Currency Matters (“ASC 830”). 2. Lack of timely action in reversing accruals when the underlying obligation is no longer a liability of the Company. The Company determined that it did not maintain effective control to ensure that the preceding items were properly accounted for in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which constitutes a material weakness. A material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company’s annual or interim financial information will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As a result of the internal control deficiency, the Company’s refundable taxes, accrued expenses and income and other taxes were overstated during each of the fiscal years 2008 to 2018. We have adjusted the comparative presentation of amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements as of January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2018 and for the year ended December 31, 2018 included in this Report as a correction of errors. To address these deficiencies, we have since remediated our control procedures to reduce the likelihood of these errors recurring. We have implemented additional quarterly control procedures (i) to review any changes in events affecting the designation of assets and liabilities to ensure that such assets and liabilities are properly remeasured; and (ii) to review outstanding accruals to confirm that the underlying obligation of the accrual is still valid. This Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management’s report was not subject to attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only management’s report in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting The company made the changes to its internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) referred to above during the last fiscal quarter to which this report relates to address the material weakness, which changes have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

INNODATA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS F- 1 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Stockholders Innodata Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Innodata Inc. and Subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and its results of operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Adoption of New Accounting Standard As discussed in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification ASU 2016-02 , beginning January 1, 2019 and applied the practical expedients consistently for all of its leases. Restatement As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company restated the 2018 consolidated financial statements. The impact of errors relating to periods prior to the year ended December 31, 2018 are reflected as an adjustment in the consolidated financial statements as of January 1, 2018 and errors relating to 2018 are reflected as an adjustment in the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2018 and for the year ended December 31, 2018. /s/ CohnReznick LLP Roseland, New Jersey March 16, 2020 We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2008.

The Company’s Agility intelligent data platform provides marketing communications and public relations professionals with the ability to target and distribute content to journalists and social media influencers world-wide and to monitor and analyze global news channels (print, web, radio and TV) and social media channels. The Company also provides a variety of services for clients in the information industry that relate to content operations and product development. Principles of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Innodata Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, and the Synodex and docGenix limited liability companies that are majority-owned by the Company. The non-controlling interests in the Synodex and docGenix limited liability companies are accounted for in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) non-controlling interest guidance. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Use of Estimates - In preparing financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates and changes in the estimates are recorded when known. Significant estimates include those related to the allowances for doubtful accounts and billing adjustments, long-lived assets, intangible assets, goodwill, valuation of deferred tax assets, valuation of stock-based compensation, litigation accruals and estimated accruals for various tax exposures. F- 8 INNODATA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Revenue Recognition – Revenue is recognized when the Company satisfies its performance obligations under the contract, either implicit or explicit, by transferring the promised goods or rendering a service to its customer either when control of the promised product is transferred to a client or the service is rendered, in an amount that reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services as per the agreement with the client. For agreements with multiple performance obligations, the Company identifies each performance obligation and evaluates whether the performance obligations are distinct within the context of the agreement at the agreement’s inception. The Company allocates the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation proportionately based on the estimated standalone selling price for each performance obligation, if any, and then evaluates how the goods are transferred to or services are performed for the client to determine the timing of revenue recognition. Performance obligations that are not distinct at agreement inception are combined. For the DDS segment, revenue is recognized primarily based on the quantity delivered or resources utilized in the period in which services are performed and performance conditions are satisfied as per the agreement. Revenues for agreements billed on a time-and-materials basis are recognized as services are performed. Revenues under fixed-fee agreements, which are not significant to the overall revenues, are recognized based on the proportional performance method of accounting, as services are performed, or milestones are achieved. For the Synodex segment, revenue is recognized primarily based on the quantity delivered in the period in which services are performed and performance conditions are satisfied as per the agreement. A portion of the Company’s Synodex segment revenue is derived from licensing our functional software and providing access to our hosted software platform. Revenue from such services is recognized monthly when all parties to the agreement have agreed to the agreement; each party’s rights are identifiable; the payment terms are identifiable; the agreement has commercial substance; access to the service is provided to the end user; and collection is probable. The Agility segment derives its revenue primarily from subscription arrangements and provision of enriched media analysis services. It also derives revenue as a reseller of corporate communication solutions. Revenue from subscriptions is recognized monthly when access to the service is provided to the end user; all parties to the agreement have agreed to the agreement; each party’s rights are identifiable; the payment terms are identifiable; the agreement has commercial substance; and collection is probable. Revenue from enriched media analysis services is recognized when the services are performed, and performance conditions are satisfied. Revenues from the reseller agreements are recognized at gross with the Company functioning as a principal due to the Company meeting the following criteria. The Company acts as the primary obligor in the sales transaction; assumes the credit risk; sets the price; can select suppliers; and is involved in the execution of the services, including after sales service. Revenues include reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses, with the corresponding out-of-pocket expenses included in direct operating costs. The Company considers U.S. GAAP criteria for determining whether to report revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent. Factors considered include whether the Company is the primary obligor, has risks and rewards of ownership, and bears the risk that a client may not pay for the services performed. If there are circumstances where the above criteria are not met and therefore, the Company is not the principal in providing services, amounts received from clients are presented net of payments in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Contract acquisition cost, which is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets, for our Agility segment is amortized over the term of a subscription agreement that normally has a duration of 12 months or less. The Company reviews these costs on a periodic basis to determine the need to adjust the carrying values for pre-terminated contracts. Foreign Currency Translation - The functional currency of our delivery centers located in the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka and Israel is the U.S. dollar. Transactions denominated in the Philippine pesos, Indian and Sri Lankan rupees and Israeli shekels are translated to U.S. dollars at rates which approximate those in effect on the transaction dates. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at December 31, 2019 and 2018 are translated at the exchange rate in effect as of those dates. Nonmonetary assets, liabilities, and stockholders’ equity were translated at the appropriate historical rates. Included in direct operating costs were exchange losses resulting from such transactions of approximately $158,000 and $56,000 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. F- 9 INNODATA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The functional currency for the Company’s subsidiaries in Germany, the United Kingdom and Canada are the Euro, the Pound Sterling and the Canadian dollar, respectively. The financial statements of these subsidiaries are reported in these respective currencies. Financial information is translated from the applicable functional currency to the U.S. dollar (the reporting currency) for inclusion in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Income, expenses and cash flows are translated at weighted average exchange rates prevailing during the fiscal period, and assets and liabilities are translated at fiscal period-end exchange rates. Resulting translation adjustments are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders' equity. Foreign exchange transaction gains or losses are included in direct operating costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The amount of foreign currency translation adjustment was $566,000 and ($779,000) for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Derivative Instruments - The Company has designated its derivatives (foreign currency forward contracts) as a cash flow hedge. Accordingly, the Company initially reports the effective portion of the derivative’s gain or loss as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and subsequently reclassifies them to earnings when the hedge exposure affects earnings. The Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedging activities. The total notional value of outstanding foreign currency forward contracts at December 31, 2019 was $4.3 million. Cash Equivalents - For financial statement purposes (including cash flows), the Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Property and Equipment - Property and equipment are stated at cost and are depreciated on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which is generally two to five years. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the lives of the leases. Certain assets under capital leases are amortized over the lives of the respective leases or the estimated useful lives of the assets, whichever is shorter. Long-lived Assets - Management assesses the recoverability of its long-lived assets, which consist primarily of fixed assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The following factors, if present, may trigger an impairment review: (i) significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results; (ii) significant negative industry or economic trends; (iii) significant decline in the Company’s stock price for a sustained period; and (iv) a change in the Company’s market capitalization relative to net book value. If the recoverability of these assets is unlikely because of the existence of one or more of the above-mentioned factors, an impairment analysis is performed, initially using a projected undiscounted cash flow method. Management makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of these respective assets. An impairment loss will be recognized only if the carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable, exceeds its fair value, and is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair value. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets – The Company performs a valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed on each acquisition accounted for as a business combination and allocates the purchase price of each acquired business to its respective net tangible and intangible assets and liabilities. Acquired intangible assets principally consist of technology, client relationships, backlog and trademarks. Liabilities related to intangibles principally consist of unfavorable vendor contracts. The Company determines the appropriate useful life by performing an analysis of expected cash flows based on projected financial information of the acquired businesses. Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method, which approximates the pattern in which the majority of the economic benefits are expected to be consumed. Intangible assets are amortized into direct operating costs ratably over their expected related revenue streams over their useful lives. F- 10 INNODATA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the fair value of the acquired net assets. The Company does not amortize goodwill but evaluates it for impairment at the reporting unit level annually during the third quarter of each fiscal year (as of September 30 of that year) or when an event occurs, or circumstances change, that indicates the carrying value may not be recoverable. In 2018, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2017-04, “Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Accounting for Goodwill Impairment”. Under this guidance, the optional qualitative assessment, referred to as “Step 0”, and the first step of the quantitative assessment (“Step 1”) remained unchanged versus the prior guidance. However, the requirement to complete the second step (“Step 2”), which involved determining the implied fair value of goodwill and comparing it to the carrying value of that goodwill to measure the impairment loss, was eliminated. As a result, Step 1 is used to determine both the existence and amount of goodwill impairment. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying value of goodwill in that reporting unit. The Company periodically analyzes whether any indicators of impairment have occurred. As part of these periodic analyses, we compare the Company’s estimated fair value, as determined based on our stock price, to the Company’s net book value. During 2018, due to a continuing decline in the Company’s stock price and other indicators of impairment that arose during the second quarter of 2018, the Company deemed it appropriate to assess goodwill impairment as of June 30, 2018, rather than the historical testing date of September 30. Based on the Company’s assessment, the Company concluded that the goodwill of the DDS segment, amounting to $675,000, was fully impaired. The Company performed its annual goodwill assessment for the Agility segment as of September 30, 2019. In performing the assessment, the Company adhered to the provisions of ASU 2017-04 by using a single step approach that determines the carrying value of goodwill and comparing it against the excess of the reporting unit’s fair value. Based on the Company’s assessment, the Company reached the conclusion that there was no goodwill impairment because the fair value of the Agility segment’s goodwill exceeded its carrying value. Therefore, there was no goodwill impairment recorded during the year ended December 31, 2019. Income Taxes - Estimated deferred taxes are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates, as well as any net operating loss or tax credit carryforwards expected to reduce taxes payable in future years. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the estimated deferred tax assets will not be realized. While the Company considers future taxable income in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event that the Company anticipates that it will be able to realize the estimated deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount, an adjustment to the provision for deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made. Similarly, in the event that the Company anticipates that it will not be able to realize the estimated deferred tax assets in the future considering future taxable income, an adjustment to the provision for deferred tax assets would decrease income in the period such determination was made. Changes in the valuation allowance from period to period are included in the Company’s tax provision in the period of change. The Company indefinitely reinvests the foreign earnings in its foreign subsidiaries. If such earnings are repatriated in the future, or are no longer deemed to be indefinitely reinvested, the Company would have to accrue as a liability the applicable amount of foreign jurisdiction withholding taxes associated with such remittances. In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considered whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the U.S. and Canadian deferred tax assets will not be realizable. As the expectation of future taxable income resulting from the Synodex and Agility segments cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company maintains a valuation allowance against all the U.S. and Canadian deferred tax assets. F- 11 INNODATA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Company accounts for income taxes regarding uncertain tax positions, and recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Accounting for Leases - In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842),” as modified (ASU 2016-02), which replaced existing leasing rules with a comprehensive lease measurement and recognition standard and expanded disclosure requirements. ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets as liabilities, with corresponding “right-of-use” assets and is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, subject to early adoption. The Company adopted ASU 2016-02 effective January 1, 2019. Upon adoption, the Company recognized a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability. See Note 6, Operating Leases. The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at the inception date and requires an assessment of whether the fulfillment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets or the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset. A reassessment is made after inception of the lease only if one of the following applies: Whenever a reassessment is made, lease accounting shall commence or cease from the date when the change in circumstances gave rise to the reassessment for scenarios (a), (c) or (d) and at the date of renewal or extension period for scenario (b). Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as operating leases. All of the Company’s leases are classified as operating leases. Operating lease payments are recognized as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - The Company measures and recognizes stock-based compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors based on the estimated fair value at the grant date. The stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period. The fair value is determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The stock-based compensation expense related to the Company’s stock plan was allocated as follows (in thousands): Fair Value of Financial Instruments - The carrying amounts of financial instruments approximated their fair value as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, because of the relative short maturity of these instruments. See Note 14, Financial Instruments. F- 12 INNODATA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Fair value measurements and disclosures define fair value as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The accounting standard establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels. The three levels are defined as follows: Accounts Receivable - The Company establishes credit terms for new clients based upon management’s review of their credit information and project terms, and performs ongoing credit evaluations of its clients, adjusting credit terms when management believes appropriate based upon payment history and an assessment of the client’s current creditworthiness. The Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its clients to make required payments. The Company determines its allowance by considering a number of factors, including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due (accounts outstanding longer than the payment terms are considered past due), the Company’s previous loss history, the client’s current ability to pay its obligation to the Company, and the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole. This cannot guarantee that credit loss rates in the future will not be greater than those experienced in the past. In addition, there is credit exposure if the financial condition of one of the Company’s major clients were to deteriorate. In the event that the financial condition of one of the Company’s clients were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be necessary. The allowance for doubtful accounts as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 was approximately $0.8 million and $1.0 million, respectively. Concentration of Credit Risk - The Company maintains its cash with highly rated financial institutions, located in the United States and in foreign locations where the Company has its operations. At December 31, 2019, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $10.9 million, of which $4.8 million was held by its foreign subsidiaries with local banks located mainly in Asia and $6.1 million was held in the United States. To the extent that such cash exceeds the maximum insurance levels, the Company would be uninsured. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts. Income (Loss) per Share – Income (loss) per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted income (loss) per share is computed by considering the impact of the potential issuance of common shares, using the treasury stock method, on the weighted average number of shares outstanding. For those securities that are not convertible into a class of common stock, the “two class” method of computing income (loss) per share is used. Pension - The Company records annual pension costs based on calculations, which include various actuarial assumptions including discount rates, compensation increases and other assumptions involving demographic factors. The Company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends. The Company believes that the assumptions used in recording its pension obligations are reasonable based on its experience, market conditions and inputs from its actuaries. F- 13 INNODATA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Deferred Revenue - Deferred revenue represents payments received from clients in advance of providing services and amounts deferred if conditions for revenue recognition have not been met. Included in accrued expenses on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets is deferred revenue amounting to $1.1 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. Recent Accounting Pronouncements – In January 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2016-01, “Financial Instruments – Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities” (ASU 2016-01), which updates certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. The Company adopted this standard in the first quarter of 2019, and it did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. In August 2018 , the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-14, “Compensation-Retirement Benefits-Defined Benefit Plans-General: Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans” (ASU 2018-14), that makes changes to the disclosure requirements for employers that sponsor defined benefit pension and/or other postretirement benefit plans. The guidance eliminates requirements for certain disclosures that are no longer considered cost beneficial and adds new disclosure requirements that the FASB considers pertinent. ASU 2018-14 is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2020 for public entities; early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the early adoption of ASU 2018-14 but does not expect it to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Correction of Errors – During the quarter ended December 31, 2019, the Company determined that the refundable taxes recorded in one of its subsidiaries were not being properly revalued in accordance with ASC 830 “Foreign Currency Matters.” Under ASC 830, entities whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar are required to use the remeasurement method and classify accounts into monetary and non-monetary items. Under this method only monetary accounts are subject to foreign currency remeasurement. Monetary accounts are those items whose amounts are fixed in terms of unit of currency by contract or otherwise. The refundable taxes in our foreign subsidiary should have been classified as monetary assets but were excluded from remeasurement. This exclusion resulted in the understatement of the foreign exchange gains and losses for the years 2008 through 2018. Additionally, the Company identified and corrected an error relating to an overstatement of two long-standing accruals that the Company deemed to no longer be necessary. The Company evaluated the materiality of these errors on both a quantitative and qualitative basis under the guidance of ASC 250, “Accounting Changes and Errors Corrections,” and determined that it did not have a material impact on previously issued financial statements. Although the errors were immaterial to prior periods, the 2018 financial statements are restated below in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, “Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements”, due to the significance of the out-of-period correction to the 2019 period. The impact of the errors for the improper remeasurement of the refundable taxes and the long-standing accruals relating to periods prior to the year ended December 31, 2019 are reflected as an adjustment to the 2018 direct operating costs in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss while the remainder of the errors were adjusted in the 2018 beginning retained earnings. Quarterly periods not presented herein will be revised, as applicable, in future filings. F- 14 INNODATA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS A reconciliation of the effects of the restatement to amounts in the previously reported consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 is as follows (in thousands): 29,812 F- 15 INNODATA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS During the preparation of the 2018 consolidated financial statements, the Company identified a cumulative error in accounting for pension expense under ASC 715, resulting in an immaterial understatement of pension liabilities and overstatement of retained earnings. The cumulative error resulted from the cumulative effect of under-recorded pension expense from December 31, 2008 through December 31, 2013 with respect to the Company’s DDS segment. The cumulative error resulted in an understatement of pension liabilities and an overstatement of retained earnings, each by an aggregate amount of $269,000 and was included in the 2018 reported amounts. The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 were as follows (in thousands): The Company recorded a full goodwill impairment of $675,000 for its DDS segment in the year ended December 31, 2018. The Company periodically analyzes whether any indicators of impairment have occurred. As part of these periodic analyses, the Company compares its estimated fair value, as determined based on its stock price, to its net book value. The continued decline in the Company’s stock price was viewed by the Company as a triggering event under ASU 2017-04, “Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Accounting for Goodwill Impairment” (ASU 2017-04), which required an assessment for possible goodwill impairment as of June 30, 2018. Under the provisions of ASU 2017-04, which the Company opted to early adopt, goodwill impairment is recognized based on Step 1 of the current guidance, which calculates the carrying value in excess of the reporting unit’s fair value. The Company performed this assessment as of June 30, 2018 and determined that the fair value of the Agility segment exceeded its carrying value, but the fair value of the DDS segment was below its carrying value. As a result, the Company recorded a full goodwill impairment of $675,000 for the DDS segment reporting unit as of June 30, 2018. The Company performed its annual goodwill assessment for the Agility segment as of September 30, 2019. In performing the assessment, the Company adhered to the provisions of ASU 2017-04 by using a single step approach that determines the carrying value of goodwill and comparing it against the excess of the reporting unit’s fair value. Based on the Company’s assessment, the Company reached the conclusion that there was no goodwill impairment because the fair value of the Agility segment’s goodwill exceeded its carrying value. Therefore, there was no goodwill impairment recorded during the year ended December 31, 2019. F- 16 INNODATA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The fair value measurement of goodwill for all segments was classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy because the Company used the income approach, which utilizes significant inputs that are unobservable in the market. The Company believes it made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of the reporting unit as of the impairment test measurement date (in thousands): Information regarding our acquisition-related intangible assets was as follows for the dates indicated (in thousands): Amortization expense relating to acquisition-related intangible assets was approximately $1.0 million for both years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. Estimated annual amortization expense for intangible assets subsequent to December 31, 2019 is as follows (in thousands): F- 17 INNODATA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS In December 2017, the President signed the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (2017 Tax Act), which includes a broad range of provisions, many of which significantly differ from those contained in previous U.S. tax law. Changes in tax law are accounted for in the period of enactment. As such, the 2017 consolidated financial statements reflect the immediate tax effect of the 2017 Tax Act, which was enacted on December 22, 2017 (Enactment Date). The 2017 Tax Act contains several key provisions including, among other things: Pursuant to the 2017 Tax Act, we recorded the following adjustments to income tax expense during the fourth quarter of 2017: Beginning January 1, 2018, the Company performed a calculation of the GILTI provisions and concluded that it has no impact on account of the net losses of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries. F- 18 INNODATA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The significant components of the provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were as follows (in thousands): The reconciliation of the U.S. statutory rate with the Company’s effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 is summarized as follows (in thousands, except percentage information): F- 19 INNODATA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current. Significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 were as follows (in thousands): In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realizable. The ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences are deductible and net operating losses are available. As of December 31, 2019, the Company continues to maintain a valuation allowance on all U.S. and Canadian deferred tax assets. The Company maintained a valuation allowance of approximately $6.5 million and $6.1 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The valuation allowance relates to U.S. and the Company’s Canadian subsidiaries deferred tax assets. The net change in the total valuation allowance was an increase of $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to an increase of $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Despite the access to the overseas earnings and the resulting toll charge, we intend to indefinitely reinvest the foreign earnings in our foreign subsidiaries on account of the foreign jurisdiction withholding tax that the Company has to incur on the actual remittances. Unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries amounted to approximately $25.7 million at December 31, 2019. If such earnings are repatriated in the future, or are no longer deemed to be indefinitely reinvested, the Company would have to accrue the applicable amount of foreign jurisdiction withholding taxes associated with such remittances. F- 20 INNODATA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The 2017 Tax Act imposes a mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and eliminates U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiary distribution. Due to the one-time transition tax on the deemed repatriation of post-1986 undistributed foreign subsidiary earnings and profits, all previously unremitted earnings for which no U.S. deferred tax liability had been accrued have now been subjected to U.S. federal income tax. As a result, earnings in foreign jurisdictions are available for distribution to the U.S. without incremental U.S. taxes. To the extent the Company repatriates these earnings to the United States, it estimates that it will not incur significant additional taxes related to such amounts, however, the estimates are provisional and subject to further analysis. United States and foreign components of income (loss) before provision for income taxes for each of the two years ended December 31, were as follows (in thousands): 2018 ( Restated) At December 31, 2019, the Company had available U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $15.3 million. These net operating loss carryforwards expire at various times through the year 2035. At December 31, 2019, the Company’s Canadian subsidiaries had available net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $13.4 million in Canada which begin to expire in 2028. In addition, these subsidiaries also have research and development credits of approximately $1.5 million available to reduce taxable income in future years, which may be carried forward indefinitely. The potential benefits from these balances have not been recognized for financial statement purposes. The Company had unrecognized tax benefits of $3.0 million and $2.4 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The portion of unrecognized tax benefits relating to interest and penalties was $0.2 million and $0.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, if recognized, would have an impact on the Company’s effective tax rate. The Company is subject to Federal income tax, as well as income tax in various states and foreign jurisdictions. The Company has open tax years for U.S. Federal and State taxes from 2015 through 2019. Various foreign subsidiaries have open tax years from 2003 through 2019, some of which are under audit by local tax authorities. The Company believes that its ASC 740 accruals as of December 31, 2019 are adequate to cover the Company’s income tax exposures. The following table represents a roll forward of the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits and associated interest for the years ended (amounts in thousands): F- 21 INNODATA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Tax assessments In September 2015, the Company’s Indian subsidiary was subject to an inquiry by the Service Tax Department in India regarding the classification of services provided by this subsidiary, asserting that the services provided by this subsidiary fall under the category of online information and database access or retrieval services (OID Services), and not under the category of business support services (BS Services) that are exempt from service tax as historically indicated in the subsidiary’s service tax filings. The Company disagrees with the Service Tax Department’s position. In November 2019, the Commissioner of Central Tax, GST & Central Excise issued an order confirming the Service Tax Department’s position. The Company is contesting this order in an appeal to the Customs, Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal . In the event the Service Tax Department is ultimately successful in proving that the services fall under the category of OID Services, the revenues earned by the Company’s Indian subsidiary for the period July 2012 through November 2016 would be subject to a service tax of between 12.36% and 15%, and this subsidiary may also be liable for interest and penalties . The revenue of our Indian subsidiary during this period was approximately $66.0 million. In accordance with new rules promulgated by the Service Tax Department, as of December 1, 2016 service tax is no longer applicable to OID or BS Services. Based on the assessment of the Company’s counsel, the Company has not recorded any tax liability for this case. In a separate action relating to service tax refunds, in October 2016, the Company’s Indian subsidiary received notices from the Indian Service Tax Department in India seeking to reverse service tax refunds of approximately $160,000 previously granted to our Indian subsidiary for three quarters in 2014, asserting that the services provided by this subsidiary fall under the category of OID Services and not BS Services. The appeal was determined in favor of the Service Tax Department. The Company disagrees with the basis of this decision and is contesting it. The Company expects delays in its Indian subsidiary receiving further service tax refunds until this matter is adjudicated with finality, and currently has service tax credits of approximately $1.0 million recorded as a receivable. Based on the assessment of the Company’s counsel, the Company has not recorded any tax liability for this case. Substantial recovery against the Company in the above referenced 2015 Service Tax Department case could have a material adverse impact on the Company, and unfavorable rulings or recoveries in other tax proceedings could have a material adverse impact on the consolidated operating results of the period in which the rulings or recovery occurs. F- 22 INNODATA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Total long-term obligations as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 consisted of the following (in thousands): (1) Represents payment to be made pursuant to a settlement agreement entered into in December 2018 between a subsidiary of the Company and 19 former employees of such subsidiary. The balance is payable in monthly installments through March 2023. (2) In March 2017, the Company renewed a vendor agreement to acquire certain additional software licenses and to receive support and subsequent software upgrades on these and other currently owned software licenses through February 2020. Pursuant to this agreement, the Company was obligated to pay approximately $0.4 million annually over the term of the agreement. Litigation – In 2008, a judgment was rendered in the Philippines against a Philippine subsidiary of the Company that is no longer active and purportedly also against Innodata Inc., in favor of certain former employees of the Philippine subsidiary. The potential payment amount aggregates to approximately $6.4 million, plus legal interest that accrued at 12% per annum from August 13, 2008 to June 30, 2013, and thereafter accrued and continues to accrue at 6% per annum. The potential payment amount as expressed in U.S. dollars varies with the Philippine peso to U.S. dollar exchange rate. In December 2017, a group of 97 of the former employees of the Philippine subsidiary indicated that they proposed to record the judgment as to themselves in New Jersey. In January 2018, in response to an action initiated by Innodata Inc., the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey (USDC) entered a preliminary injunction that enjoins these former employees from pursuing or seeking recognition or enforcement of the judgment against Innodata Inc. in the United States during the pendency of the action and until further order of the USDC. In June 2018, the USDC entered a consent order administratively closing the action subject to return of the action to the active docket upon the written request of Innodata Inc. or the former employees, with the USDC retaining jurisdiction over the matter and the preliminary injunction remaining in full force and effect. The Company is also subject to various other legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. F- 23 INNODATA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS While management currently believes that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position or overall trends in consolidated results of operations, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties. Substantial recovery against the Company in the above-referenced Philippine action could have a material adverse impact on the Company, and unfavorable rulings or recoveries in the other proceedings could have a material adverse impact on the consolidated operating results of the period in which the ruling or recovery occurs. In addition, the Company’s estimate of the potential impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position or overall consolidated results of operations for the above referenced legal proceedings could change in the future. The Company’s legal reserves related to legal proceedings and claims are based on the Company’s determination of whether or not a loss is probable. The Company reviews outstanding proceedings and claims with external counsel to assess probability and estimates of loss. The reserves are adjusted if necessary. While the Company intends to defend these matters vigorously, adverse outcomes that it estimates could reach approximately $300,000 in the aggregate beyond recorded amounts are reasonably possible. If circumstances change, the Company may be required to record adjustments that could be material to its reported consolidated financial condition and results of operations. Foreign Currency - To the extent that the currencies of the Company’s production facilities located in the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka and Israel fluctuate, the Company is subject to risks of changing costs of production after pricing is established for certain client projects. In addition, the Company is exposed to the risk of foreign currency fluctuation on the non-U.S. dollar denominated revenues, and on the monetary assets and liabilities held by its foreign subsidiaries that are denominated in local currency. Indemnifications - The Company is obligated under certain circumstances to indemnify directors, certain officers and employees against costs and liabilities incurred in actions or threatened actions brought against such individuals because such individuals acted in the capacity of director, officer or fiduciary of the Company. In addition, the Company has contracts with certain clients pursuant to which the Company has agreed to indemnify the client for certain specified and limited claims. These indemnification obligations occur in the ordinary course of business and, in many cases, do not include a limit on potential maximum future payments. As of December 31, 2019, the Company has not recorded a liability for any obligations arising as a result of these indemnification obligations. The Company has various lease agreements for its offices and service delivery centers. The Company has determined that the risks and benefits related to the leased properties are retained by the lessors. Accordingly, these are accounted for as operating leases. These lease agreements are for terms ranging from two to eleven years and, in most cases, provide for rental escalations ranging from 1.75% to 10%. Most of these agreements are renewable at the mutual consent of the parties to the contract. The Company adopted ASU 2016-02 , beginning January 1, 2019 and applied the practical expedients consistently for all of its leases. Accordingly, the Company: In addition, the Company elected to retrospectively determine the lease term and assess impairment of the right-of-use asset. At the date of transition, the Company recognized an operating lease liability and right-of-use asset. The amount of lease liability is equal to the present value of the remaining lease payments as of January 1, 2019, discounted using the incremental borrowing rate of each respective country. F- 24 INNODATA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS A right-of-use asset is measured as the amount of the lease liability adjusted for the amount of deferred straight-line rent, prepaid rent and lease incentive allowances previously recognized. The table below summarizes the amounts recognized in the financial statements related to operating leases for the years presented (in thousands): The following table presents the maturity profile of the Company’s operating lease liabilities based on the contractual undiscounted payments with a reconciliation of these amounts to the remaining net present value of the operating lease liability reported in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019 (in thousands): The weighted average remaining lease terms and discount rates for all of our operating leases as of December 31, 2019 were as follows: F- 25 INNODATA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS U.S. Defined Contribution Pension Plan - The Company has a defined contribution plan qualified under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, pursuant to which substantially all of its U.S. employees are eligible to participate after completing six months of service. Participants may elect to contribute a portion of their compensation to the plan. Under the plan, the Company has the discretion to match a portion of participants’ contributions. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company did not make any matching contributions. Non-U.S. Pension Benefits - The accounting standard for pensions requires an employer to recognize a net liability or asset and an offsetting adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss to report the funded status of defined benefit pension and other post-retirement benefit plans. Most of the non-U.S. subsidiaries provide for government-mandated defined pension benefits. For certain of these subsidiaries, vested eligible employees are provided a lump sum payment upon retiring from the Company at a defined age. The lump sum amount is based on the salary and tenure as of retirement date. Other non-U.S. subsidiaries provide for a lump sum payment to vested employees on retirement, death, incapacitation or termination of employment, based upon the salary and tenure as of the date employment ceases. The liability for such defined benefit obligations is determined and provided on the basis of actuarial valuations. As of December 31, 2019, these plans were unfunded. Pension expense for foreign subsidiaries totaled approximately $0.3 million and $0.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Included in the $0.7 million pension expense for the year ended 2018 is $269,000 representing the correction of an understatement of pension liabilities from prior years. The following table summarizes the amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of taxes (in thousands): The following table sets out the status of the non-U.S. pension benefits and the amounts (in thousands) recognized in the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of and for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2019: F- 26 INNODATA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Benefit Obligations: Components of Net Periodic Pension Cost: The accumulated benefit obligation, which represents benefits earned to date, was approximately $2.9 million and $1.7 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 consisted of the following (in thousands): Current accrued benefit cost for pension benefits was included in the current portion of long-term obligations in the consolidated balance sheets. Non-current accrued benefit cost for pension benefits was included in long-term obligations, net of current portion, in the consolidated balance sheets. Actuarial assumptions for all non-U.S. plans are described below. The discount rates are used to measure the year end benefit obligations and the earnings effects for the subsequent year. The assumptions for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2019 were as follows: F- 27 INNODATA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Estimated Future Benefit Payments: As of December 31, 2019, the following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, were expected to be paid (in thousands): Common Stock - The Company is authorized to issue 75,000,000 shares of common stock. Each share of common stock has one vote. Subject to preferences that may be applicable to any outstanding shares of preferred stock, the holders of common stock are entitled to receive ratably such dividends, if any, as may be declared by the Board of Directors. No common stock dividends have been declared to date. Preferred Stock - The Company is authorized to issue 4,998,000 shares of preferred stock. The Board of Directors is authorized to fix the terms, rights, preferences and limitations of the preferred stock and to issue the preferred stock in series that differ as to their relative terms, rights, preferences and limitations. Stockholders Rights Agreement - On February 1, 2019, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right (each, a “Right,” and collectively, the “Rights”) for each outstanding share of the Company’s common stock on February 15, 2019. The description and terms of the Rights are set forth in a Rights Agreement between the Company and American Stock Transfer & Trust Co., as rights agent, dated as of February 1, 2019 (the “Rights Agreement”). Each Right entitles its holder to purchase, under certain conditions, one one-thousandth of a share of Series C Participating Preferred Stock (“Preferred Stock”). Each one one-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock has substantially the same rights as one share of the Company’s common stock. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Rights Agreement, Rights become exercisable ten days after the public announcement that a “Person” has become an “Acquiring Person” (as each such term is defined in the Rights Agreement) by obtaining beneficial ownership of 20% or more of the Company’s outstanding common stock, or, if earlier, ten business days (or a later date determined by the Board of Directors before any Person becomes an Acquiring Person) after a Person begins a tender or exchange offer which, if completed, would result in that Person becoming an Acquiring Person. Any Rights held by an Acquiring Person are void and may not be exercised. If a Person becomes an Acquiring Person, all holders of Rights, except the Acquiring Person, may purchase at the Right’s then-current exercise price, the Company’s common stock having a market value equal to twice the exercise price. Moreover, at any time after a Person becomes an Acquiring Person (unless such Person acquires 50 percent or more of the common stock of the Company then outstanding, as more fully described in the Rights Agreement), the Board of Directors may exchange one share of the Company’s common stock for each outstanding Right (other than rights owned by such Person, which would have become void). In addition, if the Company is acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction after a Person becomes an Acquiring Person, all holders of Rights, except the Acquiring Person, may purchase at the Right’s then-current exercise price, a number of the acquiring company’s common stock having a market value of twice the exercise price. If the Company receives a “qualifying offer” (which includes certain all-cash fully financed tender offers or exchange offers for all of the Company’s outstanding common stock), under certain circumstances, holders of 10 percent of the Company’s outstanding common stock (excluding stock held by the offeror and its affiliates and associates) may direct the Board of Directors to call a special meeting of stockholders to consider a resolution exempting such “qualifying offer” from the Rights Agreement. The Rights themselves have no voting power. The Board of Directors may redeem the Rights at an initial redemption price of $0.001 per Right under certain circumstances set forth in the Rights Agreement. F- 28 INNODATA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Rights Agreement was approved by the Company’s stockholders at the 2019 annual meeting. The Rights will expire on January 31, 2022 unless earlier redeemed or exchanged. Common Stock Reserved - As of December 31, 2019, the Company had available for future issuance approximately 3,340,470 shares of common stock pursuant to the Company’s stock option plans. Treasury Stock - In July 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2.0 million of its common stock in open market or private transactions. There is no expiration date associated with the program. As of December 31, 2019, the Company repurchased 1,503,095 shares of its common stock under the July 2019 authorization. On June 7, 2016, stockholders of the Company approved amendments to the Innodata Inc. 2013 Stock Plan. The Innodata Inc. 2013 Stock Plan, as amended and restated effective June 7, 2016, is referred to herein as the “Plan.” The number of shares of common stock of Innodata Inc. that may be delivered, purchased or used for reference purposes (with respect to stock appreciation rights or stock units) for awards granted under the Plan after June 7, 2016 is 5,858,892 (the Share Reserve). Shares subject to an option or stock appreciation right granted under the Plan after June 7, 2016 count against the Share Reserve as one share for every share granted, and shares subject to any other type of award granted under the Plan after June 7, 2016 count against the Share Reserve as two shares for every share granted. Any award, or portion of an award, under the Plan or under the Company’s 2009 Stock Plan (as amended and restated (the Prior Plan)) that expires or terminates unexercised, becomes unexercisable or is forfeited or otherwise terminated, surrendered or canceled as to any shares without delivery of shares or other consideration will be added back to the Share Reserve as one share for each such share that was subject to an option or stock appreciation right granted under the Plan or the Prior Plan, and two shares for each such share that was subject to an award other than an option or stock appreciation right granted under the Plan or the Prior Plan. If any shares are withheld, tendered or exchanged by a participant in the Plan as full or partial payment to Innodata of the exercise price under an option under the Plan or the Prior Plan or in satisfaction of a participant’s tax withholding obligations with respect to any award under the Plan or the Prior Plan, there will be added back to the Share Reserve one share for each such share that was withheld, tendered or exchanged in respect of an option or stock appreciation right granted under the Plan or the Prior Plan, and two shares for each such share that was withheld, tendered or exchanged in respect of an award other than an option or stock appreciation right granted under the Plan or the Prior Plan. The fair value of stock options is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The weighted-average fair value of the options granted and weighted-average assumptions were as follows: The Company estimates the risk-free interest rate using the U.S. Treasury yield curve for periods equal to the expected term of the options in effect at the time of grant. The expected term of options granted is based on a combination of vesting schedules, term of the options and historical experience. Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the Company’s common stock. The Company uses an expected dividend yield of zero since it has never declared or paid any dividends on its capital stock. F- 29 INNODATA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS A summary of option activity under the Plans as of December 31, 2019, and changes during the year then ended, are presented below: The total compensation cost related to non-vested stock options not yet recognized as of December 31, 2019 totaled approximately $1.3 million. The weighted-average period over which these costs will be recognized is 26 months. There were no option exercises during the year ended December 31, 2018.

Revenues from external clients and segment operating profit (loss), and other reportable segment information were as follows (in thousands): F- 31 INNODATA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS F- 32 INNODATA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Long-lived assets as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 by geographic region were comprised of (in thousands): Two clients in the DDS segment generated approximately 26% and 30% of the Company’s total revenues in the fiscal years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. No other client accounted for 10% or more of total revenues during these periods. Further, in the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, revenues from non-US clients accounted for 55% and 56%, respectively, of the Company's revenues. Revenues for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2019 by geographic region (determined based upon client’s domicile), were as follows (in thousands): As of December 31, 2019, approximately 60% of the Company's accounts receivable was due from foreign (principally European) clients and 44% of accounts receivable was due from three clients. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 57% of the Company's accounts receivable was due from foreign (principally European) clients and 48% of accounts receivable was due from three clients. No other client accounted for 10% or more of the accounts receivable as of December 31, 2019. F- 33 INNODATA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Basic loss per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted loss per share is computed by considering the impact of the potential issuance of common shares, using the treasury stock method, on the weighted average number of shares outstanding. For those securities that are not convertible into a class of common stock, the two-class method of computing loss per share is used. Options to purchase 6.8 million and 5.0 million shares of common stock for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, were outstanding but not included in the computation of diluted loss per share because the effect would have been anti-dilutive. The Company conducts a large portion of its operations in international markets that subject it to foreign currency fluctuations. The most significant foreign currency exposures occur when revenue and associated accounts receivable are collected in one currency and expenses to generate that revenue are incurred in another currency. The Company’s primary exchange rate exposure relates to payroll, other payroll costs and operating expenses in the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka and Israel. In addition, although most of the Company’s revenues are denominated in U.S. dollars, a significant portion of the total revenues is denominated in Canadian dollars, Pound Sterling and Euros. The Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking hedge transactions. The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. All derivatives are recognized at their fair value and classified based on the instrument’s maturity date. As of December 31, 2018, we had no outstanding forward contracts. The total notional amount for outstanding derivatives as of December 31, 2019 was $4.3 million. F- 34 INNODATA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The following table presents the fair value of derivative instruments included within the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands): The effect of foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges on the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were as follows (in thousands): The carrying amounts of financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximated their fair value as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, because of the relative short maturity of these instruments. “ Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ” defines fair value as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The accounting standard establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels. The three levels are defined as follows: ¨ Level 1 : Unadjusted quoted price in active market for identical assets and liabilities. ¨ Level 2: Inputs other than those included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. ¨ Level 3: Unobservable inputs reflecting management’s own assumptions about the inputs used in pricing the asset or liability.

Business Overview Innodata Inc. (NASDAQ: INOD) is a global services and technology company. We combine human expertise with deep learning technologies to power leading information products and enterprise artificial intelligence (AI)/digital transformation. The Company, founded in 1988 and headquartered in northern New Jersey, features a 3,500-strong global delivery and technology team spanning ten offices globally and a research and technology incubator, Innodata Labs, which focuses on applied machine learning and emerging artificial intelligence. Our core services are (i) data acquisition, transformation, and enrichment at scale; (ii) digital operations management and analytics; and (iii) content applications. We report our core business as the Digital Data Solutions (DDS) segment. We also have venture businesses that leverage our core capabilities to provide specific industry solutions. Our Synodex venture business delivers a SaaS platform and managed services for digital transformation of medical data. Our Agility PR Solutions (Agility) venture business delivers a SaaS platform and managed service for delivering news, information, and content to targeted journalists and influencers as well as monitoring and analyzing coverage across traditional and social media sources. Each venture business is reported as a separate segment. 1 Our Core Business (Digital Data Solutions (DDS) Segment) We specialize in combining deep neural networks and human expertise in multiple domains (including health, science, and law) to make “unstructured information” (sometimes referred to as “content”) useable. For business information companies, “useable” means that the content can be sold via subscription to a digital product . For enterprises, “useable” means that the content can drive digital process transformation and AI . We work with all classes of data, including sensitive and protected data. We also develop digital products for business information companies and digital systems which replace legacy systems and processes. In 2018, we continued to implement a strategy we initiated in 2017 focused on technology differentiation, increasingly taking an innovation-led approach to create value for clients while driving leaner, more cost-effective operations. Our Approach: Deep Neural Networks and Experts-in-the-loop Finding the right approach for mixing machines and experts-in-the-loop for each customer requirement is one of our core competencies. On the human side, we have over three thousand staff with deep domain expertise in legal, tax, regulatory, scientific, technical, and health-related content. Many hold advanced degrees. They work from our global operations centers in North and South America, Europe, Israel, India, Sri Lanka and the Philippines. Our operations centers in Asia are ISO 27001 certified. On the technology side, we use deep learning, a sophisticated machine learning technique which is a branch of artificial intelligence that has enjoyed great success in real-world applications. In our approach, content is fed first into our deep learning machines that automate much of the work, but distinguish between what they can automatically process and what requires human intervention. Work that requires humans is “pushed” to human experts. Once human experts perform tasks, their output is then fed back to the machines, which, as a result, become “smarter” and achieve over time progressively greater levels of automation. ( See “Our Technology and Infrastructure”, below. ) Our Customers Our customers include leading digital businesses in banking and financial services, technology, and digital retailing and four of the largest information industry companies in the world, spanning financial, legal, healthcare and scientific vertical markets. 1 Our customers often seek to use digital data in combination with AI to support their businesses or to digitally transform operations. Our information industry customers sell subscriptions to data products that require enhanced digital data. 1 According to Outsell Inc., business information is a $1.7 trillion industry consisting of more than 7,000 publishers, information providers and software service firms worldwide. Many of our clients specialize in the scientific, technical and health (STH) area (estimated revenues of $14.6 billion) and the legal and regulatory (L&R) area (estimated revenues of $24.3 billion). “Information Industry Outlook 2019 – Trust is the New Algorithm.” (October 3, 2018). 2 Our Services In order to use content in an information product or in AI, there are often significant obstacles that must be overcome: the content may be contained in multiple websites; it may be in disparate formats; and it may lack the necessary semantics and metadata to make it product- or AI-ready. Innodata overcomes these obstacles by combining advanced technology and human subject matter experts, enabling us to produce highly refined product- and AI-ready content efficiently and at scale. Acquiring unstructured data often involves monitoring thousands of sources such as websites in real-time for new or changing content and then automatically extracting the changed content. One of the challenges with web data monitoring and extraction is that the HTML code underlying web pages often changes, causing programs and scripts to break. We overcome this by using enterprise-class tools for content change detection and extraction. These tools use both machine learning-based visual data abstraction combined with traditional programmatic approaches. With visual abstraction, the technology knows what the content “looks like” and recognizes when a data element moves from one spot on a Web page to another. Digital data transformation can refer to a large number of very specific tasks necessary to create well-structured, valid XML, such as text zoning, editing, format tagging, format conversion, extraction, cross-reference capture, and linking. Digital data enrichment often includes structural tagging as well as semantic enrichment such as entity tagging and normalization. Data enrichment also includes text categorization - classifying content to systems that organize knowledge such as ontologies and knowledge graphs. This kind of enrichment enables powerful information retrieval and discovery and provides hooks for integration and interoperability. We provide digital operations management and analytics for an increasing diversity of complex functions. At present, these include IP rights management, contract management, customer relations, data processing, regulatory reporting, publishing workflow management, publisher relationship management, and transaction management. Our services draw on a combination of industry and functional expertise from our thousands of global delivery resources, many with advanced degrees, augmented by sophisticated machine learning and robotics process automation (RPA) technology. Our digital operations management solutions often leverage our core competency in augmenting human expert effort with advanced technology and configuring the technology to continually improve as a result of expert feedback. In this way, we provide high-quality, cost-effective solutions for our customers that become increasingly automated, resulting in further cost and improvements in both productivity and response time. Many of the operations we manage are mission-critical for our customers (as opposed to back-office), are unique, and have multiple contingencies and potential points of failure. To manage this complexity, we have developed methodologies and best practices around process management and risk mitigation, and we work with clients at a strategic business and technology level. Examples of recent deployments: 3 We develop and maintain applications used in conjunction with product- or AI-ready content we create. Our content applications address knowledge representation, search/discovery, and digital transformation of customer workflows. Our scope of services spans full-stack development, knowledge engineering, and integration support. Examples of recent engagements: Our Technology and Infrastructure Our deep learning technologies are built on frameworks such as TensorFlow and Torch that layer algorithms to create artificial neural networks that continuously learn on the job, constantly improving the quality and accuracy of results. Our content processing application infrastructure consists of three integrated tiers. The first tier is an orchestration layer featuring a console we use to configure our workflow engines. Each workflow is customized around the content acquisition, transformation, and enrichment tasks required to transform a specific input into a specific output. This is where we oversee and manage AI, setting our accuracy thresholds and quality assurance parameters to decide when cognitive tasks that have been performed by machines are sent for human review. The second tier of our data processing application infrastructure is a microservices layer of deep learning networks which perform discrete tasks automatically. Microservices are invoked by workflows via RESTful APIs. Our deep neural networks are trained to understand domain-specific terms and meaning and can be deployed to enforce privacy and maintain customer-proprietary learning. We have built domain-specific and task-specific microservices that perform deep sequence labelling, text categorization, and computer vision. The technology works by observing text patterns using algorithms and assigning labels based on these observed values. For each cognitive decision, the machines provide a result together with a confidence score. A high confidence score means the machine is confident that it has performed accurately and the content is ready to be deployed in an information product or for AI. A low confidence score means expert review is required. Our third layer is human experts-in-the-loop. When an expert review is required, the human experts use tools we refer to as “workbenches” to apply their expertise to a task. The workbenches are integrated with the microservice endpoints in one of two ways. In one deployment, only low-confidence data is sent to workbenches for human review. In an alternative deployment, we send both high-confidence and low-confidence data back to the workbench, displaying the confidence level for each decision taken by the machine. In both of these deployments, human-reviewed work is retroactively fed back into the deep neural network, enabling it to get smarter. The result is continuous, predicable improvement and progressively greater levels of automation. 4 Our data storage and application hosting platform has been built utilizing an innovative enterprise infrastructure platform enabling robust performance scaling, strong security, high availability, and advanced business continuity. We support a range of strategies to suit our customers’ needs for data security, compliance, scalability and reliability. We can host data and applications in our own data centers at our production facilities or we can utilize third-party cloud services which provide the benefit of “infinite scalability” of hardware resources. When we are processing sensitive information for banks and insurance companies, we utilize U.S.-based, co-located data centers in combination with advanced data encryption (both at rest and in motion to the AES 256 or similar standard) and desktop virtualization technologies, ensuring that data never leaves secured environments in the U.S. We employ a range of security features including monitored firewalls and intrusion detection devices. We can deploy on-premises, as well, and our machine learning microservices can be consumed via API. We comply with the requirements of the United States Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 as amended (HIPAA) (including by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Data (HITECH)) and the United Kingdom’s Data Protection Act 2018, as applicable. Innodata Inc. is certified to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework, which certification includes Synodex and Agility as covered entities. Our DDS segment includes our Innodata docGenix, LLC subsidiary (docGenix). As of December 31, 2018, Innodata Inc. owned 94% of docGenix. Our Venture Businesses Our venture businesses provide specific industry solutions. We have chosen to invest in these businesses because they leverage one or more of our core capabilities (typically data acquisition/transformation/enrichment at scale, content applications, and global workforce deployment), have attractive business models such as SaaS (software-as-a-service), and expand our addressable market. Each venture business is reported as its own business segment. Synodex Segment Synodex (www.synodex.com) enables clients in the insurance and healthcare sectors to transform medical records into useable digital data and to apply technologies to the digital data to augment decision support. The main focus of the Synodex business is the extraction and classification of data from unstructured medical records in an innovative way to provide improved data service capabilities for insurance underwriting, insurance claims, medical records management, life settlement claims, and clinical trial support services. Synodex has developed and deployed its APS.Extract ® product for specific use with life insurance underwriting and claims. Our Synodex segment operates through our Innodata Synodex, LLC subsidiary. As of December 31, 2018, Innodata Inc. owned 92.5% of Innodata Synodex, LLC, an increase of 1.5% from December 31, 2017. At the end of 2018, Synodex had 11 clients, including RGA Reinsurance Company and John Hancock Insurance. RGA Reinsurance Company is the principal operating subsidiary of Reinsurance Group of America, Incorporated (NYSE: RGA), one of the top 10 largest providers of life reinsurance in the world according to A.M. Best. John Hancock Insurance is the insurance operating unit of John Hancock Financial (a division of Manulife) and one of the largest life insurers in the United States. Synodex is engaged in business discussions with other reinsurance companies and insurance carriers that have expressed interest in utilizing its services. 5 Agility Segment Agility PR Solutions (www.agilitypr.com) provides tools and related professional services that enable public relations (PR) and communications professionals to discover influencers, amplify messages, monitor coverage, and measure the impact of campaigns. Agility has been ranked as the #1 easiest to use media database and as a leader in media and influencer targeting and media monitoring, out-performing significantly larger, more established competitors. 2 The media intelligence solutions market is estimated to be $3.2 billion and growing 7% annually. 3 The market is highly fragmented, with only a limited number of providers of integrated solutions such as Agility. Agility’s software-as-a-service (SaaS) tools include: Agility’s professional services include: To provision our services, we maintain a big data engine that stores and indexes media content.

Our Opportunity Digital data has gained an increasing role across enterprises that seek to use AI to drive analytics and enhance operational excellence. At the same time, information companies are seeking to shift from products that are exclusively discovery-based products to products that provide predictive and prescriptive value. To accomplish these objectives, businesses often seek the ability to aggregate, integrate, transform and enhance data on a massive scale. 2 G2 Crowd 3 Burton-Taylor 6 At the same time, digital businesses are pushing the boundaries of how technology can improve process and operational efficiencies. To accomplish these objectives, businesses often seek the ability to manage complex operations leveraging the benefits of sophisticated technologies. We believe that we are well-poised to benefit from these global trends, enabling us to enhance our existing services as our customers’ needs evolve and to increase our addressable market opportunity by developing new solution offerings and expanding into adjacent markets. Clients Two clients in our DDS segment each generated more than 10% of our total revenues in the 2018 and 2017 fiscal years. In 2018, revenues from Wolters Kluwer affiliated companies (the “WK Clients”) were approximately $10.6 million or 19% of total revenues, and revenues from Reed Elsevier affiliated companies (the “RE Clients”) were approximately $6.4 million, or 11% of total revenues. No other client generated more than 10% of our total revenues in 2018. These two clients together generated approximately 30% of our total revenues in each of the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. We have long-standing relationships with many of our clients, and we have provided services to the two clients mentioned in the preceding paragraph for over ten years. Our track record of delivering high-quality services helps us to solidify client relationships. Many of our clients are recurring clients, meaning that they have continued to provide additional projects to us after our initial engagement with them. Our contractual arrangements with the RE Clients during 2018 consisted of three master services agreements (“MSAs”) and separately agreed to statements of work (“SOWs”) for specific services. Two of the MSAs have indefinite terms and the third MSA has a term that ends on October 31, 2019. RE Clients may terminate the MSAs on notice periods ranging from zero to six months, and they may terminate certain individual SOWs on notice periods of up to 90 days. They may also terminate certain of the MSAs and SOWs on notice periods of three months or less for “cause” and for insolvency related events, and on changes of control, force majeure and the imposition of certain price increases by the Company that are not acceptable to them. We may terminate two of the MSAs on notice periods of 180 days, and we may also terminate certain MSAs and SOWs for “cause”, insolvency related events affecting the RE Clients, and other defined events. The MSAs contain confidentiality, limitation of liability, indemnification and other standard provisions. Our contractual arrangements with the WK Clients during calendar year 2018 consisted of four MSAs and separately agreed to SOWs for specific services. Two MSAs have indefinite terms, one MSA continues in effect until the completion of all services performed under the MSA, and the fourth MSA has a term that ends on the later of March 2, 2020 or the expiration date of all SOWs issued under the MSA. WK Clients may terminate certain MSAs on notice periods of 30 days, and they may terminate certain individual SOWs on notice periods ranging from 10 days to six months. WK Clients may also terminate certain of the MSAs and SOWs on notice periods of 60 days or less for “cause” and for insolvency related events, and on changes of control, force majeure and the imposition of certain price increases by the Company that are not acceptable to them. We may terminate certain of the MSAs on notice periods of 30 days, and we may also terminate certain MSAs and SOWs for “cause”, insolvency related events affecting the WK Clients, and other defined events. The MSAs contain confidentiality, limitation of liability, indemnification and other standard provisions. Our agreements with our other clients are in many cases terminable on 30 to 90 days' notice. A substantial portion of the services we provide to our clients is subject to their requirements. 7 Competitive Strengths Our expertise in digital data.

Locations We are headquartered in Ridgefield Park, New Jersey, just outside New York City. Our Agility business is headquartered in Ottawa, Canada and we have an additional location in London, the United Kingdom. We have ten delivery centers in the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka, Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom and Israel. Employees As of December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 147 persons in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, and over 3,000 persons in ten global delivery centers in the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka, Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom and Israel. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 212 of our employees were dedicated to the Synodex segment, and approximately 261 of our employees were dedicated to the Agility segment. Most of our employees have graduated from at least a two-year college program. Many of our employees hold advanced degrees in law, business, technology, medicine and social sciences. No employees are currently represented by a labor union, and we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory.

We have historically relied on a very limited number of clients that have accounted for a significant portion of our revenues, and our results of operations could be adversely affected if we were to lose one or more of these significant clients. We have historically relied on a very limited number of clients that have accounted for a significant portion of our revenues. Two clients in our DDS segment generated approximately 30% of our total revenues in each of the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. No other client accounted for 10% or more of total revenues during these periods. Further, in the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, revenues from non-US clients accounted for 56% and 51%, respectively, of our revenues. We may lose any of these clients, or our other major clients, as a result of our failure to meet or satisfy our client’s requirements, the completion or termination of a project or engagement, or the client’s selection of another service provider. In addition, the volume of work performed for our major clients may vary from year to year, and services they require from us may change from year to year. They may also request that we modify certain key terms of our agreements with them as a condition of continuing to do business with us. If the volume of work performed for our major clients varies, if the services they require from us change, or if they require price concessions, our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected, and we may incur a loss from operations. If certain key terms of our agreements with our major clients are modified, our revenues and results of operations may be adversely affected. Our services are typically subject to client requirements, and in many cases are terminable upon 30 to 90 days’ notice. We have no bank facilities or line of credit. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and internally generated funds will provide sufficient sources of liquidity to satisfy our financial needs for the next 12 months. However, we have no bank facilities or lines of credit, and reductions in our cash and cash equivalents from operating losses, capital expenditures, adverse legal decisions, acquisitions or otherwise could materially and adversely affect the Company. See “Management Discussion and Analysis – Liquidity and Capital Resources” for additional information. Our common stock may become subject to delisting from The Nasdaq Stock Market. Nasdaq may under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810 delist the Company’s common stock if the closing bid price for its common stock is less than $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive business days and the Company does not thereafter cure all listing deficiencies during Nasdaq-designated compliance periods. A portion of our services is provided on a non-recurring basis for specific projects, and our inability to replace large projects when they are completed or otherwise terminated has adversely affected, and could in the future adversely affect, our revenues and results of operations. We provide a portion of our services for specific projects that generate revenues that terminate on completion of a defined task. While we seek, wherever possible, on completion or termination of large projects, to counterbalance periodic declines in revenues with new arrangements to provide services to the same client or others, our inability to obtain sufficient new projects to counterbalance any decreases in such work may adversely affect our future revenues and results of operations. A portion of our revenue is generated from projects which we characterize as recurring in nature. Projects that we characterize as recurring are nevertheless subject to termination. Our operating performance is materially dependent on the continuation of these projects. However, we are exposed to risks where these projects could be terminated by our clients and we may not be able to replace these terminated projects with new recurring projects with similar profitability or clients may ask for a price reduction which could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations. 11 Our solutions for the Agility segment are sold pursuant to subscription agreements, and if subscription clients elect either not to renew these agreements, or to renew these agreements for less expensive services, our revenues and results of operations will be adversely affected. Our Agility segment derives its revenues primarily from subscription arrangements. Our clients may choose not to renew subscription agreements when they expire or may renew them at lower prices or for a significantly narrower scope of work. If large numbers of existing subscription clients do not renew these agreements or renew these agreements on terms less favorable to us, and if we cannot replace or supplement those non-renewals with new subscription agreements generating the same or greater level of revenue, our revenues and results of operations will be adversely affected. New acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic investments or partnerships could harm our operating results. We may pursue acquisitions, joint ventures or engage in strategic investments or partnerships to grow and enhance our capabilities. We cannot assure that we will successfully consummate any acquisitions or joint ventures, or profit by strategic investments, or achieve desired financial and operating results. Further, such activities involve a number of risks and challenges, including proper evaluation, diversion of management’s attention and proper integration with our current business. Accordingly, we might fail to realize the expected benefits or strategic objectives of any such venture we undertake. If we are unable to complete the kind of acquisitions for which we plan, we may not be able to achieve our planned rates of growth, profitability or competitive position in specific markets or services. A large portion of our accounts receivable is payable by a limited number of clients; the inability of any of these clients to pay its accounts receivable would adversely affect our results of operations. Several significant clients account for a large percentage of our accounts receivable. If any of these clients were unable, or refused, for any reason, to pay our accounts receivable, our financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. As of December 31, 2018, 48% or $5.1 million, of our accounts receivable was due from three clients. See “Management Discussion and Analysis – Liquidity and Capital Resources.” In addition, we evaluate the financial condition of our clients and usually bill and collect on relatively short cycles. We maintain specific allowances against doubtful receivables. Actual losses on client balances could differ from those that we currently anticipate and, as a result, we might need to adjust our allowances. There is no guarantee that we will accurately assess the creditworthiness of our clients. Macroeconomic conditions could also result in financial difficulties, including limited access to the credit markets, insolvency or bankruptcy, for our clients, and, as a result, could cause clients to delay payments to us, request modifications to their payment arrangements that could increase our receivables balance, or default on their payment obligations to us. If we are unable to collect timely from our clients, our cash flows could be adversely affected. Quarterly fluctuations in our revenues and results of operations could make financial forecasting difficult and could negatively affect our stock price. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, significant fluctuations in our quarterly revenues and results of operations. During the past eight quarters, our net income ranged from a profit of approximately $693,000 in the third quarter of 2018 to a loss of approximately $2.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. 12 We experience fluctuations in our revenue and earnings as we replace and begin new projects, which may have some normal start-up delays, or we may be unable to replace a project entirely or on terms that are as attractive to us as the project that is being replaced. These and other factors may contribute to fluctuations in our results of operations from quarter to quarter. A high percentage of our operating expenses, particularly personnel and rent, are relatively fixed in advance of any particular quarter. As a result, unanticipated variations in the number and timing of our projects, or in employee wage levels and utilization rates, may cause us to significantly underutilize our production capacity and employees, resulting in significant variations in our operating results in any particular quarter, and have resulted in losses. The economic environment and pricing pressures could negatively impact our revenues and operating results. Due to the intense competition involved in outsourcing and information technology services, we generally face pricing pressures from our clients. Our ability to maintain or increase pricing is restricted as clients generally expect to receive volume discounts or special pricing incentives as we do more business with them; moreover, our large clients may exercise pressure for discounts outside of agreed terms. Our profitability could suffer if we are not able to maintain pricing on our existing projects and win new projects at appropriate margins. Our profit margin, and therefore our profitability, is dependent on the rates we are able to recover for our services. If we are not able to maintain pricing on our existing services and win new projects at profitable margins, or if we underestimate the costs or complexities of new projects and incur losses, our profitability could suffer. The rates we are able to recover for our services are affected by a number of factors, including competition, volume fluctuations, productivity of employees and processes, the value our client derives from our services and general economic and political conditions. If our pricing structures do not accurately anticipate the cost and complexity of performing our work, then our contracts could be unprofitable. We provide services either on a time-and-materials basis or on a fixed-price basis. Our pricing is highly dependent on our internal forecasts and predictions about our projects, which might be based on limited data and could turn out to be inaccurate. If we do not accurately estimate the costs and timing for completing projects, our contracts could prove unprofitable for us or yield lower profit margins than anticipated. We may not be able to obtain price increases that are necessary to offset the effect of wage inflation and other government mandated cost increases. We have experienced wage inflation and other government mandated cost increases in the Asian countries where we have the majority of our operations. In addition, we may experience adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. These global events have put pressure on our profitability and our margins. Although we have tried to partially offset wage increases, foreign currency fluctuations and other such increases through price increases and improving our efficiency, we cannot ensure that we will be able to continue to do so in the future, which would negatively impact our results of operations. 13 If our clients are not satisfied with our services, they may terminate our contracts with them or our services, which could have an adverse impact on our business. Our business model depends in large part on our ability to attract additional work from our base of existing clients. Our business model also depends on relationships our account teams develop with our clients so that we can understand our clients’ needs and deliver solutions and services that are tailored to those needs. If a client is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us, or with the type of services or solutions delivered, then we could incur additional costs to address the situation, the profitability of that work might be impaired, and the client’s dissatisfaction with our services could damage our ability to obtain additional work from that client. In particular, clients that are not satisfied might seek to terminate existing contracts, which would mean that we could incur costs for the services performed with no associated revenue upon termination of a contract. This could also direct future business to our competitors. In addition, negative publicity related to our client services or relationships, regardless of its accuracy, may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new contracts with current and prospective clients. Our new clients may sunset their products because of lack of sufficient revenues or declining revenues, and this may result in termination of our work for these clients. As we obtain new opportunities and win new business, our clients may not generate the level of revenues that we initially anticipated at the time of signing a contract with them, or our clients may experience declining revenues with their existing products. This could be due to various reasons beyond our control, and it could lead to termination of projects or contracts. As we normally invest in people or technology and incur other costs in anticipation of revenues, any such deviation from our expected plan would impact our margins and earnings. Our business will suffer if we fail to develop new services and enhance our existing services in order to keep pace with the rapidly evolving technological environment or provide new service offerings, which may not succeed. The information technology and consulting services industries are characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, changing client preferences, new product and service introductions and the emergence of new vendors with lean cost and flexible cost models. Our future success will depend on our ability to develop solutions that keep pace with changes in the markets in which we provide services. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in developing new services, addressing evolving technologies on a timely or cost-effective basis or, if these services are developed, that we will be successful in the marketplace. We also cannot guarantee that we will be able to compete effectively with new vendors offering lean cost and flexible cost models, or that products, services or technologies developed by others will not render our services non-competitive or obsolete. Our failure to address these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We invest in developing and pursuing new service offerings from time to time. Our profitability could be reduced if these services do not yield the profit margins we expect, or if the new service offerings do not generate the planned revenues. We have made and continue to make significant investments towards building-out new capabilities to pursue growth. These investments increase our costs, and if these services do not yield the revenues or profit margins we expect, and we are unable to grow our business and revenue proportionately, our profitability may be reduced, or we may incur losses. We depend on third-party technology in the provision of our services. We rely upon certain software that we license from third parties, including software integrated with our internally developed software used in the provision of our services. These third-party software licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable or competitive terms, if at all. The loss of, or inability to maintain or obtain any of these software licenses, could result in delays in the provision of our services until we develop, identify, license and integrate equivalent software. Any delay in the provision of our services could damage our business and adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, our Company utilizes third party data centers to serve our clients and generate revenue. Any disruption in provision of services from these data centers could result in loss of revenue, client dissatisfaction and loss of clients. 14 Our Agility segment relies on third parties to provide certain content and data for our solutions, and if those third-parties discontinue providing their content, our revenue and results of operations could be adversely affected. Our Agility segment relies on third parties to provide or make available certain data for our information databases and our news and social media monitoring service. These third parties may not renew agreements to provide content to us or may increase the price they charge for their content. Additionally, the quality of the content provided to us may not be acceptable to us and we may need to enter into agreements with additional third parties. In the event we are unable to use such third-party content or are unable to enter into agreements with new third parties, current clients may discontinue their relationship with us, and it may be difficult to acquire new clients. Our businesses are reliant on key employees, and we may face high attrition in our talent. We may not be able to replace displaced talent with new talent on a timely basis or with equivalent skill sets. We are reliant to a considerable degree on the continuing leadership of our Chief Executive Officer and would be materially and adversely affected should he unexpectedly not be employed by us. In addition, our businesses are subject to fierce competition for talent which could result in high attrition of our employees, or we may not be able to find the requisite talent to operate our businesses. A significant increase in the attrition rate among employees with specialized skills could decrease our operating efficiency and productivity. Our failure to attract, train and retain personnel with the qualifications necessary to fulfill the needs of our existing and future clients or to assimilate new employees successfully could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, fluctuations in our business may require that we lay off employees with possible negative effects on employee morale. We try to minimize these risks by actively promoting employee relationships and offering competitive salaries, but if we cannot mitigate these risks, our business and our operating performance could be adversely affected. We compete in highly competitive markets. The markets for our services are highly competitive. Some of our competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, human, technical and other resources and greater name recognition than we do. If we fail to be competitive with these companies in the future, we may lose market share, which could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. There are relatively few barriers preventing companies from competing. As a result, new market entrants also pose a threat to our business. We also compete with in-house personnel at current and prospective clients, who may attempt to duplicate our services using their own personnel. If we are not able to compete effectively, our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected. We operate from multiple locations and our employees are very diverse so we have significant coordination risks. We are headquartered in Ridgefield Park, New Jersey, just outside New York City, and our Agility business is headquartered in Ottawa, Canada and has an additional location in London, the United Kingdom. We have ten delivery centers in the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka, Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom and Israel. Our employees are geographically dispersed as well as culturally diverse. Our personnel need to work together to successfully execute our business plans and we invest in various measures to improve coordination and teamwork. Should we fail in these efforts our ability to execute our business plans may be adversely affected. 15 Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and if we are unable to protect them or are subject to intellectual property rights claims, our business may be harmed. Our intellectual property rights include certain trademarks, trade secrets, domain name registrations, a patent and patent applications. Although we take precautions to protect our intellectual property rights, these efforts may not be sufficient or effective. In addition, various events outside of our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights as well as to our business. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, we may experience difficulties in achieving and maintaining brand recognition. Disruptions in telecommunications, system failures, data corruption or virus attacks could harm our ability to execute our global resource model, which could result in client dissatisfaction and a reduction of our revenues. We use a distributed global resource model. Our onshore workforce provides services from our United States and Canada offices, as well as from client sites; and our offshore workforce provides services from our nine offshore delivery centers in the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka, Germany, the United Kingdom and Israel. Our global facilities are linked with a telecommunications network that uses multiple service providers. We may not be able to maintain active voice and data communications between our various facilities and our clients' sites at all times due to disruptions in these networks, system failures, data corruption or virus attacks. Any significant failure in our ability to communicate, or the availability of our platforms, could result in a disruption in our business, which could hinder our performance, or our ability to complete client projects on time, or provide services to our clients. This, in turn, could lead to client dissatisfaction and an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. A material breach in security relating to our information systems could adversely affect us. Even though we have implemented network security measures, our servers may be vulnerable to computer viruses, cyber-attacks, break-ins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering. The occurrence of any of the events described above could result in interruptions, delays, the loss or corruption of data, cessations in the availability of systems or liability under privacy laws or contracts, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. Governmental and client focus on data security could increase our costs of operations. In addition, any incident in which we fail to protect our client’s information against security breaches may result in monetary damages against us, and termination of our engagement by our client, and may adversely impact our results of operations. Certain laws and regulations regarding data privacy and security affecting our clients impose requirements regarding the privacy and security of information maintained by these clients, as well as notification to persons whose personal information is accessed by an unauthorized third party. As a result of any continuing legislative initiatives and client demands, we may have to modify our operations with the goal of further improving data security. The cost of compliance with these laws and regulations is high and is likely to increase in the future. Any such modifications may result in increased expenses and operating complexity, and we may be unable to increase the rates we charge for our services sufficiently to offset these increases. In addition, as part of the service we perform, we have access to confidential client data, including sensitive personal data. As a result, we are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect this information. We may also be bound by certain client agreements to use and disclose the confidential client information in a manner consistent with the privacy standards under regulations applicable to such client. Any failure on our part to comply with these laws and regulations can result in negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort and may subject us to significant liabilities and other penalties. If client confidential information is inappropriately disclosed due to a breach of our computer systems, system failures or otherwise, or if any person, including any of our employees, negligently disregards or intentionally breaches controls or procedures with which we are responsible for complying with respect to such data or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data, we may have substantial liabilities to our clients. Any incidents with respect to the handling of such information could subject us to litigation or indemnification claims with our clients and other parties. In addition, any breach or alleged breach of our confidentiality agreements with our clients may result in termination of their engagements, resulting in associated loss of revenue and increased costs. 16 Our international operations subject us to risks inherent in doing business on an international level, any of which could increase our costs and hinder our growth. The major part of our operations is carried on in the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka, Israel, the United Kingdom, Canada and Germany, while our headquarters are in the United States, and our clients are primarily located in North America and Europe. While we do not depend on significant revenues from sources internal to the Asian countries in which we operate, we are nevertheless subject to certain adverse economic factors relating to overseas economies generally, including inflation, external debt, a negative balance of trade and underemployment. In certain of the countries in which we operate tax authorities may exercise significant discretionary and arbitrary powers to make tax demands or decline to refund payments that may be due to us as per tax returns. Other risks associated with our international business activities include: One or more of these factors could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Our international business is subject to applicable laws and regulations relating to foreign corrupt practices, the violation of which could adversely affect our operations. We must comply with all applicable anti-bribery laws and regulations of the U.S. and other jurisdictions where we operate. For example, we are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act relating to corrupt and illegal payments to government officials and others . Although we have policies and controls in place that are designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, it is possible that an employee or an agent acting on our behalf could fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, and due to the complex nature of the risks, it may not always be possible for us to ascertain compliance with such laws and regulations. In such event, we could be exposed to civil penalties, criminal penalties and other sanctions, including fines or other unintended punitive actions, and we could incur substantial legal fees and related expenses. In addition, such violations could damage our business and/or our reputation. All of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. 17 Our international operations subject us to currency exchange fluctuations, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Although most of our revenues are denominated in U.S. dollars, a significant portion of our revenues is denominated in Canadian dollars, Pound Sterling and Euros. In addition, a significant portion of our expenses, primarily labor expenses in the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka, Germany, Canada, the United Kingdom and Israel, is incurred in the local currencies of the countries in which we operate. For financial reporting purposes, we translate all non-U.S. denominated transactions into U.S. dollars in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. We do not currently undertake hedging activities to offset the risk of adverse foreign currency fluctuations. As a result, fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and other currencies may affect our financial results. Fluctuations in exchange rates also affect the value of funds held by our foreign subsidiaries. We do not currently intend to hedge these assets. In the event that the government of India, the Philippines or the government of another country changes its tax policies, rules and regulations, our tax expense may increase and affect our effective tax rates. We are subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. We are subject to the continual examination by tax authorities in India and in the Philippines, and the Company assesses the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits could be materially different from what is reflected in historical income tax and indirect tax provisions and accruals, and could result in a material effect on the Company’s income tax provision, indirect tax expenses, net income or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made. If additional taxes are assessed, it could have an adverse impact on our financial results. In addition, changes in the tax rates, tax laws or the interpretation of tax laws in the jurisdiction where we operate, could affect our future results of operations. In 2015, the Company’s Indian subsidiary was subject to an inquiry by the Service Tax Department in India regarding the classification of services provided by this subsidiary, asserting that the services provided by this subsidiary fall under the category of online information and database access or retrieval services (OID Services), and not under the category of business support services (BS Services) that are exempt from service tax as historically indicated in this subsidiary’s service tax filings. The Company disagrees with the Service Tax Department’s position and is vigorously contesting these assertions. In the event the Service Tax Department is successful in proving that the services fall under the category of OID Services, the revenues earned by the Company’s Indian subsidiary for the period July 2012 through November 2016 would be subject to a service tax of between 12.36% and 15%. The revenue of our Indian subsidiary during this period was approximately $67.0 million. In accordance with new rules promulgated by the Service Tax Department, as of December 1, 2016 service tax is no longer applicable to OID or BS Services. In 2016, the Company’s Indian subsidiary received notices of appeal from the Indian Service Tax Department in India seeking to reverse service tax refunds of approximately $160,000 previously granted to our Indian subsidiary for three quarters in 2014, asserting that the services provided by this subsidiary fall under the category of OID Services and not BS Services. The appeal was determined in favor of the Service Tax Department. The Indian subsidiary disagrees with the basis of this decision and is contesting it vigorously. The Company expects delays in its Indian subsidiary receiving further service tax refunds until this matter is adjudicated with finality, and currently has service tax credits of approximately $1.0 million recorded as a receivable. Substantial recovery against us in the above referenced 2015 Service Tax Department case could have a material adverse impact on us, and unfavorable rulings or recoveries in other tax proceedings could have a material impact on the consolidated operating results of the period in which the rulings or recovery occurs. Based on the assessment of the Company’s counsel, the Company has not recorded any liability for this case. 18 If tax authorities in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate contest the manner in which we allocate our profits, our net income could decrease. A significant portion of the services we provide to our clients are provided by our Asian subsidiaries located in different jurisdictions. Tax authorities in some of these jurisdictions have from time to time challenged the manner in which we allocate our profits among our subsidiaries, and we may not prevail in this type of challenge. If such a challenge were successful, our worldwide effective tax rate could increase, thereby decreasing our net income. An expiration or termination of our preferential tax rate incentives could adversely affect our results of operations. One of our foreign subsidiaries is subject to preferential tax rates. These tax incentives provide that we pay reduced income taxes in those jurisdictions for a fixed period of time that varies depending on the jurisdiction, or they may result in lowering our expenses. An expiration or termination of these incentives could substantially increase our worldwide effective tax rate, or increase our tax expense, thereby decreasing our net income and adversely affecting our results of operations. Our earnings may be adversely affected if we change our intent not to repatriate our foreign earnings or if such earnings become subject to U.S. tax on a current basis. In December 2017, the President signed the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (2017 Tax Act), which includes a broad range of provisions, many of which significantly differ from those contained in previous U.S. tax law. One such provision relates to a one-time tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of post-1986 untaxed foreign earnings and profits (E&P), referred to as the toll charge. A significant portion of our operations are conducted outside the United States. Despite the access to the overseas earnings and the resulting toll charge, we intend to indefinitely reinvest the foreign earnings in our foreign subsidiaries on account of the foreign jurisdiction withholding tax that the Company has to incur on the actual remittances. Unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries amounted to approximately $21.0 million at December 31, 2018. If such earnings are repatriated in the future, or are no longer deemed to be indefinitely reinvested, the Company would have to accrue the applicable amount of foreign jurisdiction withholding taxes associated with such remittances. Anti-outsourcing legislation, if adopted, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and impair our ability to service our clients. The issue of outsourcing of services abroad by U.S. companies is a topic of political discussion in the United States. Measures aimed at limiting or restricting outsourcing by U.S. companies are under discussion in Congress and in numerous state legislatures. While no substantive anti-outsourcing legislation has been introduced to date, given the ongoing debate over this issue, the introduction of such legislation is possible. If introduced, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected and our ability to service our clients could be impaired. Our growth could be hindered by visa restrictions. Occasionally, we have employees from our other facilities visit or transfer to the United States to meet our clients or work on projects at a client’s site. Any visa restrictions or new legislation putting a restriction on issuing visas could affect our business. 19 Immigration and visa laws and regulations in the United States and other countries are subject to legislative and administrative changes as well as changes in the application of standards. Immigration and visa laws and regulations can be significantly affected by political forces and levels of economic activity. Our international expansion strategy and our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected if legislative or administrative changes to immigration or visa laws and regulations impair our ability to staff projects with our professionals who are not citizens of the country where the work is to be performed. Political uncertainty, political unrest, terrorism, and natural calamities in the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka and Israel could adversely affect business conditions in those regions, which in turn could disrupt our business and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. We conduct the majority of our production operations in the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka and Israel. These countries and regions remain vulnerable to disruptions from political uncertainty, political unrest, terrorist acts, and natural calamities. Any damage to our network and/or information systems would damage our ability to provide services, in whole or in part, and/or otherwise damage our operations and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Further, political tensions and escalation of hostilities in any of these countries could adversely affect our operations in these countries and therefore adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. Terrorist attacks or a war could adversely affect our results of operations. Terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war could affect us or our clients by disrupting normal business practices for extended periods of time and reducing business confidence. In addition, acts of violence or war may make travel more difficult and may effectively curtail our ability to serve our clients' needs, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations. We may face various risks associated with shareholder activists or shareholder demands for better performance . There is no assurance that we will not be subject to shareholder activism or demands. Such activities could interfere with our ability to execute our strategic plan, be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations, and divert the attention of management and our employees. We are the subject of continuing litigation, including litigation by certain of our former employees. In 2008, a judgment was rendered in the Philippines against a Philippines subsidiary of the Company that is no longer active and purportedly also against Innodata Inc., in favor of certain former employees of the Philippines subsidiary. The payment amount aggregates approximately $6.2 million, plus legal interest that accrued at 12% per annum from August 13, 2008 to June 30, 2013, and thereafter accrued and continues to accrue at 6% per annum. The payment amount as expressed in U.S. dollars varies with the Philippine peso to U.S. dollar exchange rate. In December 2017, a group of 97 of the former employees indicated that they proposed to record the judgment as to them in New Jersey. In January 2018, in response to an action initiated by Innodata Inc., the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey (the “USDC”) entered a preliminary injunction that enjoins these former employees from pursuing or seeking recognition or enforcement of the judgment against Innodata Inc. in the United States during the pendency of the action and until further order of the Court. In June 2018, the USDC entered a consent order administratively closing the action subject to return of the action to the active docket upon the written request of Innodata Inc. or the former employees, with the USDC retaining jurisdiction over the matter and the preliminary injunction remaining in full force and effect. The principal relevant cases in the Philippines are Court of Appeals Case Nos. CA-G.R. SP No. 93295 Innodata Employees Association (IDEA), Eleanor Tolentino, et al. vs. Innodata Philippines, Inc., et al., and CA-G.R. SP No. 90538 Innodata Philippines, Inc. vs. Honorable Acting Secretary Manuel G. Imson, et al. (28 June 2007), the Department of Labor and Employment National Labor Relations Commission, Republic of the Philippines (NLRC-NCR-Case No.07-04713-2002, et al., Innodata Employees Association (IDEA) and Eleanor A. Tolentino, et al. vs. Innodata Philippines, Inc., et al), and the Department of Labor and Employment Office of the Secretary of Labor and Employment, Republic of the Philippines (Case No. OS-AJ-0015-2001, In Re: Labor Dispute at Innodata Philippines, Inc.). The U.S. District Court action is Civil Action No.: 2:17-cv-13268-SDW-LDW Innodata Inc. v. Myrna C. Augustin-Simon; et al. 20 We are also subject to various other legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business. While we believe that we have adequate reserves for those losses we believe are probable and can be reasonably estimated, the ultimate results of legal proceedings and claims cannot be predicted with certainty. While we currently believe that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or overall trends in our consolidated results of operations, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties. Substantial recovery against us in the above- referenced Philippines action could have a material adverse impact on us, and unfavorable rulings or recoveries in the other proceedings could have a material adverse impact on the consolidated operating results of the period in which the ruling or recovery occurs. In addition, our estimate of potential impact on our consolidated financial position or overall consolidated results of operations for the above referenced legal proceedings could change in the future. See “Legal Proceedings.” Our reputation could be damaged, or our profitability could suffer if we do not meet the controls and procedures in respect of the services and solutions we provide to our clients, or if we contribute to our clients’ internal control deficiencies. Our clients may perform audits or require us to perform audits, provide audit reports or obtain certifications with respect to the controls and procedures that we use in the performance of services for such clients, especially when we process data or information belonging to them. Our ability to acquire new clients and retain existing clients may be adversely affected and our reputation could be harmed if we receive a qualified opinion, or if we cannot obtain an appropriate certification or opinion with respect to our controls and procedures in connection with any such audit in a timely manner. Additionally, our profitability could suffer if our controls and procedures were to fail or to impair our client’s ability to comply with its own internal control requirements. New and changing corporate governance and public disclosure requirements add uncertainty to our compliance policies and increase our costs of compliance. Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to accounting, corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, other SEC regulations, and the NASDAQ Stock Market rules, are creating uncertainty for companies like ours. These laws, regulations and standards may lack specificity and are subject to varying interpretations. Their application in practice may evolve over time, as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs of compliance as a result of ongoing revisions to such corporate governance standards. Although we are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure, and complying with evolving laws, regulations and standards, if we fail to comply with new or changed laws, regulations or standards of corporate governance, our business and reputation may be harmed. It is unlikely that we will pay dividends. We have not paid any cash dividends since our inception and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We expect that our earnings, if any, will be used to finance our growth. 21 Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. None. Item 2. Properties. Our services are primarily performed from our Ridgefield, New Jersey headquarters and ten overseas delivery centers in the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka, Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom and Israel, all of which are leased. The square footage of all our leased properties totals approximately 246,000. In addition, we may need to lease additional property in the future. We believe that we will be able to obtain suitable additional facilities on commercially reasonable terms on an “as needed” basis. Item 3. Legal Proceedings. In 2008, a judgment was rendered in the Philippines against a Philippines subsidiary of the Company that is no longer active and purportedly also against Innodata Inc., in favor of certain former employees of the Philippines subsidiary.

Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures. None. 22 PART II Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities. Innodata Inc. (the “Company”) Common Stock is quoted on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC under the symbol “INOD.” On February 22, 2019, there were 69 stockholders of record of the Company’s Common Stock based on information provided by the Company's transfer agent. Virtually all of the Company’s publicly held shares are held in “street name” and the Company believes the actual number of beneficial holders of its Common Stock to be 2,848. Purchase of Equity Securities In September 2011, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2.0 million of our common stock in open market or private transactions. There is no expiration date associated with the program. We did not repurchase any shares of our common stock during 2018. We did not have any sales of unregistered equity securities during the three months ended December 31, 2018. Item 6. Selected Financial Data. Not applicable. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report. In addition to historical information, this discussion includes forward-looking information that involves risks and assumptions which could cause actual results to differ materially from management’s expectations. See “Forward-Looking Statements” included elsewhere in this report. Executive Overview We are a global digital services and solution company. We operate in three reporting segments: Digital Data Solutions (DDS), Synodex and Agility. 23 The following table sets forth, for the period indicated, certain financial data expressed for the two years ended December 31, 2018: Revenues Revenue is recognized when control of the promised services is transferred to a customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those services as per the agreement with the customer. We generate all our revenue from agreements with customers. In case there are agreements with multiple performance obligations, we identify each performance obligation and evaluate whether the performance obligations are distinct within the context of the agreement at the agreement’s inception. Performance obligations that are not distinct at agreement inception are combined. We allocate the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation proportionately based on the estimated standalone selling price for each performance obligation, if any, and then evaluates how the services are transferred to the customer to determine the timing of revenue recognition. For the DDS segment, revenue is recognized primarily based on the quantity delivered or resources utilized in the period in which services are performed and performance conditions are satisfied as per the agreement. Revenues for agreements billed on a time-and-materials basis are recognized as services are performed. Revenues under fixed-fee agreements, which are not significant to the overall revenues, are recognized based on the proportional performance method of accounting, as services are performed, or milestones are achieved. For the Synodex segment, revenue is recognized primarily based on the quantity delivered in the period in which services are performed and performance conditions are satisfied as per the agreement. A portion of our Synodex segment revenue is derived from licensing our functional software and providing access to our hosted software platform. Revenue from such services is recognized monthly when access to the service is provided to the end user; all parties to the agreement have agreed to the agreement; each party’s rights are identifiable; the payment terms are identifiable; the agreement has commercial substance; and collection is probable. The Agility segment derives its revenue primarily from subscription arrangements and provision of enriched media analysis services. It also derives revenue as a reseller of corporate communication solutions. Revenue from subscriptions is recognized monthly when access to the service is provided to the end user; all parties to the agreement have agreed to the agreement; each party’s rights are identifiable; the payment terms are identifiable; the agreement has commercial substance; and collection is probable. Revenue from enriched media analysis services is recognized when the services are performed, and performance conditions are satisfied. Revenues from the reseller agreements, which are not significant to the overall revenues, are recognized at gross with our functioning as a principal due to our meeting the following criteria. We act as the primary obligor in the sales transaction; assume the credit risk, set the price; can select suppliers; and are involved in the execution of the services, including after sales service. 24 Revenues include reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses, with the corresponding out-of-pocket expenses included in direct operating costs. We consider U.S. GAAP criteria for determining whether to report revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent. Factors considered include whether we are the primary obligor, have risks and rewards of ownership, and bear the risk that a client may not pay for the services performed. If there are circumstances where the above criteria are not met and therefore, we are not the principal in providing services, amounts received from clients are presented net of payments in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Contract acquisition cost for our Agility segment is amortized over the term of the subscription agreement which normally has a duration of 12 months or less. We review these costs on a periodic basis to determine the need to adjust the carrying values for pre-terminated contracts. Direct Operating Costs Direct operating costs consist of direct payroll, occupancy costs, data center hosting fees, content acquisition costs, depreciation and amortization, travel, telecommunications, computer services and supplies, realized gain (loss) on forward contracts, foreign currency revaluation gain (loss), and other direct expenses that are incurred in providing services to our clients. Selling and Administrative Expenses Selling and administrative expenses consist of management and administrative salaries, sales and marketing costs including commissions, new services research and related software development, third-party software, advertising and trade conferences, professional fees and consultant costs, and other administrative overhead costs. Valuation of Goodwill and Intangible Assets We perform a valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed on each acquisition accounted for as a business combination and allocate the purchase price of each acquired business to its respective net tangible and intangible assets and liabilities. Acquired intangible assets principally consist of technology, customer relationships, backlog and trademarks. Liabilities related to intangibles principally consist of unfavorable vendor contracts. We determine the appropriate useful life by performing an analysis of expected cash flows based on projected financial information of the acquired businesses. Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method, which approximates the pattern in which the majority of the economic benefits are expected to be consumed. Intangible liabilities are amortized into direct operating costs ratably over their expected related revenue streams over their useful lives. Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the fair value of the acquired net assets. We do not amortize goodwill but evaluate it for impairment at the reporting unit level annually during the third quarter of each fiscal year (as of September 30th of that quarter) or when an event occurs, or circumstances change, that indicates the carrying value may not be recoverable. In 2018, we adopted ASU 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Accounting for Goodwill Impairment. Under the newly adopted guidance, the optional qualitative assessment, referred to as “Step 0”, and the first step of the quantitative assessment (“Step 1”) remained unchanged versus the prior guidance. However, the requirement to complete the second step (“Step 2”), which involved determining the implied fair value of goodwill and comparing it to the carrying value of that goodwill to measure the impairment loss, was eliminated. As a result, Step 1 will be used to determine both the existence and amount of goodwill impairment. An impairment loss will be recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying value of goodwill in that reporting unit. 25 We periodically analyze whether any indicators of impairment have occurred. As part of these periodic analyses, we compare the Company’s estimated fair value, as determined based on our stock price, to the Company’s net book value. During 2018, due to a continuing decline in its stock price and other indicators of impairment that arose during the second quarter of 2018, we deemed it appropriate to assess goodwill impairment as of June 30, 2018, rather than the historical testing date of September 30. Based on its assessment, we concluded that the goodwill of the DDS segment, amounting to $675,000, was fully impaired. We conducted our annual goodwill impairment test for the Agility segment as of September 30, 2018. The estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, including goodwill, and we concluded that there is no impairment of the goodwill of the Agility segment. Adjusted EBITDA In addition to measures of financial performance presented in our consolidated financial statements, we monitor “Adjusted EBITDA” to help us evaluate our ongoing operating performance including our ability to operate the business effectively. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) attributable to Innodata Inc. and Subsidiaries in accordance with U.S. GAAP before income taxes, depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, impairment charges, changes in fair value of contingent consideration, stock-based compensation, loss attributable to non-controlling interests and interest income (expense). We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful to our management and investors in evaluating our operating performance and for financial and operational decision-making purposes. In particular, it facilitates comparisons of the core operating performance of our Company from period to period on a consistent basis and helps us identify underlying trends in our business. We believe it provides useful information about our operating results, enhances the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects and allows for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in our financial and operational decision-making. We use this measure to establish operational goals for managing our business and evaluating our performance. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are: Adjusted EBITDA should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, U.S. GAAP net income. 26 The results below for the year ended December 31, 2017 are presented on a reclassified basis as if for the full year 2017 docGenix had been included in the DDS segment and the Synodex segment had solely included the results of Synodex. docGenix revenue was $531,000 and $1,087,000 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The following table shows the reconciliation from net income (loss) Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented (in thousands): DDS Segment 27 Synodex Segment Agility Segment Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017 The results below for the year ended December 31, 2017 are presented on a reclassified basis as if for the full year 2017 docGenix had been included in the DDS segment and the Synodex segment had solely included the results of Synodex. docGenix revenue was $531,000 and $1,087,000 in the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Revenues Total revenues were $57.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a 6% decrease from $60.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Revenues from the DDS segment were $43.5 million and $47.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decline of $4.3 million or approximately 9%. Approximately $2.3 million of the decrease is attributable to one large project that ended in 2017 and the balance is attributable to volume fluctuations from other clients . Revenues from the Synodex segment were $4.1 million and $3.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $0.4 million or approximately 11%. The increase is primarily due to additional volume from two existing clients partially offset by a reduction in volume from another client whose project ended in the first quarter of 2018. Revenues from the Agility segment were $9.8 million and $9.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $0.4 million or approximately 4%. 28 Two clients in the DDS segment generated approximately 30% of the Company’s total revenues in the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. No other client accounted for 10% or more of total revenues during these periods. Further, in the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, revenues from non-US clients accounted for 56% and 51%, respectively, of the Company's revenues. Direct Operating Costs Direct operating costs were approximately $39.0 million and $45.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $6.8 million or approximately 15%. Direct operating costs for the DDS segment were $29.7 million and $36.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $6.5 million or approximately 18%. Direct operating costs for the DDS segment as a percentage of DDS segment revenues were 68% and 76% for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease in direct operating costs is primarily attributable to labor cost savings arising from headcount reductions in the second half of 2017. Direct operating costs for the Synodex segment were approximately $3.0 million and $3.5 million for the respective periods, net of intersegment profit, a decrease of $0.5 million or 14%. The decline in direct operating costs reflects efficiencies in the production headcount. Direct operating costs for the Synodex segment as a percentage of Synodex segment revenues were 73% and 95% for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Direct operating costs for the Agility segment were approximately $6.3 million and $6.1 million, net of intersegment profit, for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $0.2 million, or 3%. Direct operating costs for the Agility segment as a percentage of Agility segment revenues were 64% and 65% for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase is primarily due to higher content related costs. Correction of Immaterial Error The 2018 DDS direct operating costs referred to above include an out-of-period adjustment of $269,000 relating to under-recorded pension liabilities relating to the period from 2008 to 2013. See note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. Selling and Administrative Expenses Selling and administrative expenses were $15.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $20.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $4.4 million or 22% due to cost rationalization implemented in the later part of 2017. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues were 28% and 33% for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Selling and administrative expenses for the DDS segment were $9.3 million and $13.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $3.8 million or 29%. As a percentage of DDS revenues, DDS selling and administrative expenses were 21% and 27% for each of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decline in selling and administrative expenses is attributable to labor cost savings arising from headcount reductions in the second half of 2017. Selling and administrative expenses for the Synodex segment were $0.7 million and $1.1 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $0.4 million or 36%. Selling and administrative expenses for the Synodex segment as a percentage of Synodex segment revenues were 17% and 30% for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Selling and administrative expenses for the Agility segment were $5.8 million and $6.0 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $0.2 million or 3%. Selling and administrative expenses for the Agility segment as a percentage of Agility segment revenues were 59% and 64% for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 29 Goodwill Impairment During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a full goodwill impairment of $675,000 for the DDS segment. There was no goodwill impairment recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017. We periodically analyze whether any indicators of impairment have occurred. As part of these periodic analyses, we compare the Company’s estimated fair value, as determined based on our stock price, to our net book value. The continued decline in our stock price was viewed as a triggering event under ASU 2017-04 which required an assessment for possible goodwill impairment as of June 30, 2018. Under the provisions of ASU 2017-04, which we opted to early adopt, goodwill impairment is recognized based on Step 1 of the current guidance, which calculates the carrying value in excess of the reporting unit’s fair value. We performed this assessment as of June 30, 2018 and determined that the fair value of the Agility segment exceeded its carrying value, but that the fair value of the DDS segment was below its carrying value. As a result, we recorded a full goodwill impairment of $675,000 for the DDS segment reporting unit as of June 30, 2018. We conducted our annual goodwill impairment test for the Agility segment as of September 30, 2018. The estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, including goodwill, and we concluded that there is no impairment of the goodwill of the Agility segment. Taxes We recorded a provision for income taxes of approximately $1.8 million and $0.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Taxes primarily consist of a provision for foreign taxes recorded in accordance with the local tax regulations by our foreign subsidiaries. Effective income tax rates are disproportionate primarily due to the valuation allowance recorded on the deferred taxes on the U.S. and Canadian entities. See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Footnote 4. “Taxes” for additional information. In December 2017, the President signed the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (2017 Tax Act), which includes a broad range of provisions, many of which significantly differ from those contained in previous U.S. tax law. Changes in tax law are accounted for in the period of enactment. As such, the 2017 consolidated financial statements reflect the immediate tax effect of the 2017 Tax Act, which was enacted on December 22, 2017 (Enactment Date). The 2017 Tax Act contains several key provisions including, among other things: 30 Pursuant to the 2017 Tax Act, we recorded the following adjustments to income tax expense during the fourth quarter of 2017: Beginning January 1, 2018, we performed a calculation of the GILTI provisions and concluded that it has no impact on account of the net losses of our foreign subsidiaries. Despite access to overseas earnings and the resulting toll charge, we intend to indefinitely reinvest foreign earnings in our foreign subsidiaries on account of the foreign jurisdiction withholding taxes that we would have to incur on the actual remittances. Unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries amounted to approximately $21.0 million at December 31, 2018. If such earnings are repatriated in the future, or are on longer deemed to be indefinitely reinvested, we would have to accrue the applicable amount of foreign jurisdiction withholding taxes associated with such remittances. We have a valuation allowance on all of our U.S. deferred tax assets on account of continuing losses incurred by our U.S. entity. In addition, we also have a valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets of our Canadian subsidiaries. Our Canadian subsidiaries also have research and development expenditures available to reduce taxable income in future years, which may be carried forward indefinitely. The potential benefits from these balances have not been recognized for financial statement purposes. Tax Assessments In October 2010, our Indian subsidiary received an assessment from the Indian Income Tax Department for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006. We disagree with the basis of this tax assessment, have filed an appeal against the assessment and are contesting it. We believe that our recorded tax liability of $329,000 for this matter, which includes interest, is adequate. In January 2012, our Indian subsidiary received an assessment from the Indian Income Tax Department for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008. We disagree with the basis of this tax assessment and successfully appealed the assessment. The income tax assessing officer has filed an appeal against the decision entered in favor of the subsidiary. We are contesting the appeal filed by the assessing officer. We believe that our recorded tax liability of $343,000 for this matter, which includes interest, is adequate. In September 2015, our Indian subsidiary was subject to an inquiry by the Service Tax Department in India regarding the classification of services provided by this subsidiary, asserting that the services provided by this subsidiary fall under the category of online information and database access or retrieval services (OID Services), and not under the category of business support services (BS Services) that are exempt from service tax as historically indicated in the subsidiary’s service tax filings. We disagree with the Service Tax Department’s position and are vigorously contesting these assertions. In the event the Service Tax Department is successful in proving that the services fall under the category of OID Services, the revenues earned by our Indian subsidiary for the period July 2012 through November 2016 would be subject to a service tax of between 12.36% and 15%. The revenue of our Indian subsidiary during this period was approximately $67.0 million. In accordance with new rules promulgated by the Service Tax Department, as of December 1, 2016 service tax is no longer applicable to OID or BS Services. Based on our counsel’s assessment, we have not recorded any tax liability for this case. 31 In October 2016, our Indian subsidiary received notices of appeal from the Indian Service Tax Department in India seeking to reverse service tax refunds of approximately $160,000 previously granted to our Indian subsidiary for three quarters in 2014, asserting that the services provided by this subsidiary fall under the category of OID Services and not BS Services. The appeal was determined in favor of the Service Tax Department. We disagree with the basis of this decision and are contesting it vigorously. We expect delays in our Indian subsidiary receiving further service tax refunds until this matter is adjudicated with finality, and currently have service tax credits of approximately $1.0 million recorded as a receivable. Based on our counsel’s assessment, we have not recorded any tax liability for this case. We have recorded a tax provision amounting to $181,000, which includes interest, for several ongoing tax proceedings in the Philippines. Although the ultimate outcome cannot be determined at this time, we continue to contest these claims vigorously. Net Income (Loss) We had a net income of $4,000 during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to a net loss of $5.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. Net income for the DDS segment was $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to a net loss of $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, net of intersegment profits. The change is due to a decline in revenues offset by a decline in direct operating costs and selling and administrative expenses attributable to our cost rationalization initiatives. Net income for the Synodex segment was $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to net loss of $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 , net of intersegment profits. The change is primarily due to an increase in revenues and a decline in direct operating costs and selling and administrative expense. Net loss for the Agility segment was $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to a net loss of $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $6.7 million compared to an Adjusted EBITDA loss of $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $7.4 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the DDS segment was $6.9 million and $1.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $5.4 million or approximately 360%. Adjusted EBITDA for the Synodex segment was $0.5 million and an Adjusted EBITDA loss of $0.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $1.4 million. Adjusted EBITDA loss for the Agility segment was of $0.7 million compared to an Adjusted EBITDA loss of $1.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an improvement of $0.6 million or approximately 46%. 32 Liquidity and Capital Resources Selected measures of liquidity and capital resources, expressed in thousands, are as follows: At December 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $10.9 million, of which $5.6 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries, and $5.3 million was held in the United States. Despite the passage of the new tax law under which we may repatriate funds from overseas after paying the toll charge, it is our intent as of December 31, 2018, to permanently reinvest the overseas funds in our foreign subsidiaries on account of the withholding tax that we would have to incur on the actual remittances. We have used, and plan to use, our cash and cash equivalents for (i) investments in the Agility Segment; (ii) the expansion of our other operations; (iii) technology innovation; (iv) product management and strategic marketing; (v) general corporate purposes, including working capital; and (vi) possible business acquisitions. As of December 31, 2018, we had working capital of approximately $13.0 million, as compared to working capital of approximately $9.7 million as of December 31, 2017. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and internally generated funds will provide sufficient sources of liquidity to satisfy our financial needs for the next 12 months. However, we have no bank facilities or lines of credit, and reductions in our cash and cash equivalents from operating losses, capital expenditures, adverse legal decisions, acquisitions or otherwise could materially and adversely affect the Company. Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Cash provided by our operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $3.6 million, resulting from a net income of $11,000 and adjustments for non-cash items of $5.6 million and uses of working capital of $2.0 million. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of $3.4 million for depreciation and amortization, stock option expense of $0.8 million, goodwill impairment of $0.7 million, pension cost of $0.5 million and deferred tax provisions of $0.2 million. Working capital activities primarily consisted of a use of cash of $1.0 million due to a decrease in accrued salaries, wages and related benefits, $0.8 million due to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses and $0.2 million due to a decrease in other working capital accounts. Cash provided by our operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $0.7 million, resulting from a net loss of $5.4 million and adjustments for non-cash items of $4.2 million and uses of working capital of $1.9 million. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of $3.7 million for depreciation and amortization, and stock-based compensation expense of $0.7 million. At December 31, 2018, our days’ sales outstanding were 66 days as compared to 61 days as of December 31, 2017. We calculate DSO by first dividing the total revenues for the period by average net accounts receivable, which is the sum of net accounts receivable at the beginning of the period and net accounts receivable at the end of the period, to yield an amount we refer to as the “accounts receivable turnover.” Then we divide the total number of days within the period reported by the accounts receivable turnover to yield DSO expressed in number of days. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities Cash used in our investing activities was $2.0 million and $3.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. These capital expenditures were principally for the purchase of technology equipment including servers, network infrastructure and workstations, and expenditures for internally developed software. Capital expenditures of $2.0 million consisted of $0.4 million for the DDS segment and $1.6 million for the Agility segment. 33 For the year 2019, we anticipate that capital expenditures for ongoing technology, equipment and infrastructure upgrades will approximate $1.0 to $2.0 million, a portion of which we may finance. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities Payment of long-term obligations approximated $2.0 million and $1.1 million for 2018 and 2017, respectively. Cash from financing activities represents the net proceeds from a capital lease transaction we entered into in 2017 amounting to $0.8 million. There were no stock option exercises during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Although most of our revenues are denominated in U.S. dollars, a significant portion of our revenues is denominated in Canadian dollars, Pound Sterling and Euros. In addition, a significant portion of our expenses, primarily labor expenses in the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka, Germany, Canada and Israel, is incurred in the local currencies of the countries in which we operate. For financial reporting purposes, we translate all non-U.S. denominated transactions into U.S. dollars in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Thus, we are exposed to the risk that fluctuations in the value of these currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could have a direct impact on our revenues and our results of operations. The Philippines and India have at times experienced high rates of inflation as well as major fluctuations in the exchange rate between the Philippine peso and the U.S. dollar and the Indian rupee and the U.S. dollar. Fluctuations in exchange rates also affect the value of funds held by our foreign subsidiaries. We do not currently intend to hedge these assets. Inflation, Seasonality and Prevailing Economic Conditions Our most significant costs are the salaries and related benefits of our employees in Asia. We are exposed to higher inflation in wage rates in the countries in which we operate. We generally perform work for our clients under project-specific contracts, requirements-based contracts or long-term contracts. We must adequately anticipate wage increases, particularly on our fixed-price contracts. There can be no assurance that we will be able to recover cost increases through increases in the prices that we charge for our services to our clients. Our quarterly operating results are subject to certain fluctuations. We experience fluctuations in our revenue and earnings as we replace and begin new projects, which may have some normal start-up delays, or we may be unable to replace a project entirely. These and other factors may contribute to fluctuations in our operating results from quarter to quarter. In addition, as some of our Asian facilities are closed during holidays in the fourth quarter, we typically incur higher wages, due to overtime, that reduce our margins. Our Synodex subsidiary experiences seasonal fluctuations in revenues. Typically, revenue is lowest in the third quarter of the calendar year and highest in the fourth quarter of the calendar year. The seasonality is directly linked to the number of life insurance applications received by the insurance companies. 34 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Basis of Presentation and Use of Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our results of operations, liquidity and capital resources is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts and billing adjustments, long-lived assets, intangible assets, goodwill, valuation of deferred tax assets, value of securities underlying stock-based compensation, litigation accruals, pension benefits, valuation of derivative instruments and estimated accruals for various tax exposures. We base our estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, including assumptions as to future events. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. By their nature, estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Actual results may differ from our estimates and could have a significant adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates and judgments in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We establish credit terms for new clients based upon management’s review of their credit information and project terms, and perform ongoing credit evaluations of our clients, adjusting credit terms when management believes appropriate, based upon payment history and an assessment of the client’s current credit worthiness. We record an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our clients to make required payments. We determine this allowance by considering a number of factors, including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due, our previous loss history, our estimate of the client’s current ability to pay its obligation to us, and the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole. We cannot guarantee that credit loss rates in the future will not be greater that those experienced in the past. In addition, we would have credit exposure if the financial condition of one of our major clients were to deteriorate. In the event that the financial condition of our clients was to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances might be necessary. Our allowance for doubtful accounts as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 was approximately $1.0 million and $1.2 million, respectively. Foreign Currency Translation The functional currency of our production operations located in the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka and Israel is the U.S. dollar. Transactions denominated in the Philippine pesos, Indian and Sri Lankan rupees or Israeli shekels are translated to U.S. dollars at rates which approximate those in effect on the transaction dates. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at December 31, 2018 and 2017 are translated at the exchange rate in effect as of those dates. Nonmonetary assets, liabilities, and stockholders’ equity were translated at the appropriate historical rates. Included in direct operating costs are exchange losses (gains) resulting from such transactions of approximately ($201,000) and $466,000 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The functional currency for our subsidiaries in Germany, the United Kingdom and Canada are the Euro, the Pound Sterling and the Canadian dollar, respectively. The financial statements of these subsidiaries are reported in these respective currencies. Financial information is translated from the applicable functional currency to the U.S. dollar (the reporting currency) for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. Income, expenses and cash flows are translated at weighted average exchange rates prevailing during the fiscal period, and assets and liabilities are translated at fiscal period-end exchange rates. Resulting translation adjustments are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity. Foreign exchange transaction gains or losses are included in direct operating costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The amount of foreign currency translation adjustment was ($779,000) and $706,000 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 35 Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized when control of the promised services is transferred to a customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those services as per the agreement with the customer. We generate all our revenue from agreements with customers. In case there are agreements with multiple performance obligations, we identify each performance obligation and evaluate whether the performance obligations are distinct within the context of the agreement at the agreement’s inception. Performance obligations that are not distinct at agreement inception are combined. We allocate the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation proportionately based on the estimated standalone selling price for each performance obligation, if any, and then evaluate how the services are transferred to the customer to determine the timing of revenue recognition. On January 1, 2018, we adopted ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”) and all related Accounting Standards Updates by applying the modified retrospective method to all contracts that were not completed on January 1, 2018. The modified retrospective approach required us to recognize the cumulative effect of initially applying the new standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings on January 1, 2018. Comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the historical accounting standards in effect for those periods. The adoption of the new revenue standard did not result in a cumulative effect adjustment to our retained earnings since there was no significant impact upon adoption of the new standard. There was also no material impact to revenues, or any other financial statement line items for the year ended December 31, 2018 as a result of applying ASC 606. We expect the impact of the adoption of ASC 606 to remain insignificant to the Company’s results of operations on an ongoing basis. For the DDS segment, revenue is recognized primarily based on the quantity delivered or resources utilized in the period in which services are performed and performance conditions are satisfied as per the agreement. Revenues for agreements billed on a time-and-materials basis are recognized as services are performed. Revenues under fixed-fee agreements, which are not significant to the overall revenues, are recognized on the percentage of completion method of accounting, as services are performed, or milestones are achieved. For the Synodex segment, revenue is recognized primarily based on the quantity delivered in the period in which services are performed and performance conditions are satisfied as per the agreement. A portion of our Synodex segment revenue is derived from licensing our functional software and providing access to our hosted software platform. Revenue from such services is recognized monthly when access to the service is provided to the end user; all parties to the agreement have agreed to the agreement; each party’s rights are identifiable; the payment terms are identifiable; the agreement has commercial substance; and collection is probable. The Agility segment derives its revenue primarily from subscription arrangements and provision of enriched media analysis services. It also derives revenue as a reseller of corporate communication solutions. Revenue from subscriptions is recognized monthly when access to the service is provided to the end user; all parties to the agreement have agreed to the agreement; each party’s rights are identifiable; the payment terms are identifiable; the agreement has commercial substance; and collection is probable. Revenue from enriched media analysis services is recognized when the services are performed, and performance conditions are satisfied. Revenues from the reseller agreements, which are not significant to the overall revenues, are recognized at gross with our functioning as a principal due to our meeting the following criteria. We act as the primary obligor in the sales transaction; assume the credit risk, set the price; can select suppliers; and are involved in the execution of the services, including after sales service. Revenue include reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses, with the corresponding out-of-pocket expenses included in direct operating costs. 36 We consider U.S. GAAP criteria for determining whether to report revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent. Factors considered include whether we are the primary obligor, have risks and rewards of ownership, and bear the risk that a client may not pay for the services performed. If there are circumstances where the above criteria are not met and therefore, we are not the principal in providing services, amounts received from clients are presented net of payments in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Contract acquisition cost for our Agility segment is amortized over the term of the subscription agreement which normally has a duration of 12 months or less. We review these costs on a periodic basis to determine the need to adjust the carrying values for pre-terminated contracts. Long-lived Assets We assess the recoverability of long-lived assets, which consist primarily of fixed assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The following factors, if present, may trigger an impairment review: (i) significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results; (ii) significant negative industry or economic trends; (iii) a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period; and (iv) a change in our market capitalization relative to net book value. If the recoverability of these assets is unlikely because of the existence of one or more of the above-mentioned factors, an impairment analysis is performed, initially using a projected undiscounted cash flow method. We make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of these respective assets. An impairment loss will be recognized only if the carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value and is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair value. Income Taxes We determine our deferred taxes based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates, as well as any net operating loss or tax credit carryforwards expected to reduce taxes payable in future years. We provide a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. While we consider future taxable income in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize the deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made. Similarly, in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize the deferred tax assets in the future considering the future taxable income, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would decrease income in the period such determination was made. Changes in the valuation allowance from period to period are included in our tax provision in the period of change. As of December 31, 2018, we intend to indefinitely reinvest the foreign earnings in our foreign subsidiaries. However, if we change our intent and repatriate such earnings, we will have to accrue the applicable amount of foreign jurisdiction withholding taxes associated with such remittances. In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considered whether it was more likely than not that all or some of the U.S. deferred tax assets would not be realizable. As of December 31, 2018, we continue to maintain a valuation allowance on all U.S. deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2018, our Canadian subsidiaries have available net operating loss carryforwards and research and development expenditures available to reduce taxable income of future years. The potential benefits from balances have not been recognized for financial statement purposes. As of December 31, 2018, we continue to maintain a valuation allowance on all Canadian deferred tax assets. We account for income taxes regarding uncertain tax positions, and recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions under “Income Tax Expense” in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. 37 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets We perform a valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed on each acquisition accounted for as a business combination and allocate the purchase price of each acquired business to its respective net tangible and intangible assets and liabilities. Acquired intangible assets principally consist of technology, customer relationships, backlog and trademarks. Liabilities related to intangibles principally consist of unfavorable vendor contracts. We determine the appropriate useful life by performing an analysis of expected cash flows based on projected financial information of the acquired businesses. Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method, which approximates the pattern in which the majority of the economic benefits are expected to be consumed. Intangible liabilities are amortized into direct operating costs ratably over their expected related revenue streams over their useful lives. Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the fair value of the acquired net assets. We do not amortize goodwill but evaluate it for impairment at the reporting unit level annually during the third quarter of each fiscal year (as of September 30th of that quarter) or when an event occurs, or circumstances change, that indicates the carrying value may not be recoverable. In 2018, we adopted ASU 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Accounting for Goodwill Impairment. Under the newly adopted guidance, the optional qualitative assessment, referred to as “Step 0”, and the first step of the quantitative assessment (“Step 1”) remained unchanged versus the prior guidance. However, the requirement to complete the second step (“Step 2”), which involved determining the implied fair value of goodwill and comparing it to the carrying value of that goodwill to measure the impairment loss, was eliminated. As a result, Step 1 will be used to determine both the existence and amount of goodwill impairment. An impairment loss will be recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying value of goodwill in that reporting unit. We periodically analyze whether any indicators of impairment have occurred. As part of these periodic analyses, we compare the Company’s estimated fair value, as determined based on our stock price, to the Company’s net book value. During 2018, due to a continuing decline in our stock price and other indicators of impairment that arose during the second quarter of 2018, we deemed it appropriate to assess goodwill impairment as of June 30, 2018, rather than the historical testing date of September 30. Based on our assessment, we concluded that the goodwill of the DDS segment, amounting to $675,000, was fully impaired. We conducted our annual goodwill impairment test for the Agility segment as of September 30, 2018. The estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, including goodwill, and we concluded that there is no impairment of the goodwill of the Agility segment. Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation We are authorized to grant stock options and other stock-based awards to officers, directors, employees and others who render services to us under the 2013 Stock Plan approved by the stockholders. We measure and recognize stock-based compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair value at the grant date and recognized over the requisite service period. Determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating the expected term of stock options and the expected volatility of our stock. The fair value is determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. We recorded stock-based compensation expense of approximately $0.8 million and $0.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Legal Proceedings We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business. Our legal reserves related to these proceedings and claims are based on a determination of whether or not a loss is probable. We review outstanding claims and proceedings with external counsel to assess probability and estimates of loss. The reserves are adjusted if necessary. If circumstances change, we may be required to record adjustments that could be material to our reported financial condition and results of operations. 38 Pensions Most of our non-U.S. subsidiaries provide for government mandated defined pension benefits covering those employees who meet certain eligibility requirements. Pension assumptions are significant inputs to actuarial models that measure pension benefit obligations and related effects on operations. Two critical assumptions – discount rate and rate of increase in compensation levels – are important elements of plan expense and asset/liability measurements. These critical assumptions are evaluated at least annually on a plan and a country-specific basis. Other assumptions involving demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality and turnover are evaluated periodically and are updated to reflect actual experience and expectations for the future. Actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors, and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the impact of these differences is accumulated and amortized over future periods. Recent Accounting Pronouncements On January 1, 2018, we adopted ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”) and all related Accounting Standards Updates by applying the modified retrospective method to all contracts that were not completed on January 1, 2018. The modified retrospective approach required us to recognize the cumulative effect of initially applying the new standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings on January 1, 2018. Comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the historical accounting standards in effect for those periods. The adoption of the new revenue standard did not result in a cumulative effect adjustment to our retained earnings since there was no significant impact upon adoption of the new standard. There was also no material impact to revenues, or any other financial statement line items for the year ended December 31, 2018 as a result of applying ASC 606. We expect the impact of the adoption of ASC 606 to remain insignificant to the Company’s results of operations on an ongoing basis. In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance related to leases. This new guidance requires lessees to recognize on the balance sheet a right-of-use asset, representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term, and a lease liability for all leases with terms greater than twelve months. The guidance also requires qualitative and quantitative disclosures designed to assess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The standard requires the use of a modified retrospective transition approach, which includes a number of optional practical expedients that entities may elect to apply . This new guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. We adopted this guidance on January 1, 2019 and are electing the package of practical expedients, which, among other things, allows us to carry forward our prior lease classifications under ASC 840. At adoption, the Company expects to recognize right of use assets of approximately $8 million and related lease liabilities of $9 million on its consolidated balance sheet for its operating leases. We do not expect ASU 2016-02 to have a material impact on our annual results of operations and/or cash flows. In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments – Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (“ASU 2016-01”), which updates certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-01 in its first quarter of 2019 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. Based on the composition of the Company’s investment portfolio, the adoption of ASU 2016-01 is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 39 In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-14, ""Compensation-Retirement Benefits-Defined Benefit Plans-General: Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans"" (""ASU 2018-14"") that makes minor changes to the disclosure requirements for employers that sponsor defined benefit pension and/or other postretirement benefit plans. The guidance eliminates requirements for certain disclosures that are no longer considered cost beneficial and adds new disclosure requirements that the FASB considers pertinent. ASU 2018-14 is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2020 for public entities, early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the early adoption of ASU 2018-14 but do not expect it to have a material impact. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure. None. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Under the supervision, and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our interim Principal Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e). Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Interim Principal Financial Officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2018, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the last fiscal quarter to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of company assets are made in accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected. 40 Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) - issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2018. This Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management’s report was not subject to attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only management’s report in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Financial Statements. INNODATA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS F- 1 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Stockholders Innodata Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Innodata Inc. and Subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and its results of operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. /s/ CohnReznick LLP Roseland, New Jersey March 25, 2019 We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2008. F- 2 INNODATA INC.

F- 6 Innodata Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Description of Business - Innodata Inc. and Subsidiaries (“we”, the “Company”, or “Innodata”) is a global services and technology company. We combine human expertise with deep learning technologies to power leading information products and enterprise artificial intelligence (AI)/digital transformation. The Company, founded in 1988 and headquartered in northern New Jersey, features a 3,500-strong global delivery and technology team spanning ten offices globally and a research and technology incubator, Innodata Labs, which focuses on applied machine learning and emerging artificial intelligence. The Company’s core services are (i) data acquisition, transformation, and enrichment at scale; (ii) digital operations management and analytics; and content applications. We report our core business as the Digital Data Solutions (DDS) segment. The Company also has venture businesses that leverage its core capabilities to provide specific industry solutions. The Company’s Synodex venture business delivers a SaaS platform and managed services for digital transformation of medical data. The Company’s Agility PR Solutions (Agility) venture business delivers a SaaS platform and managed service for delivering news, information, and content to targeted journalists and influencers as well as monitoring and analyzing coverage across traditional and social media sources. Each venture business is reported as a separate segment. Prior to the first quarter of 2018, the Company referred to the Agility segment as Media Intelligence Solutions (MIS) and the Synodex segment as Innodata Advanced Data Solutions (IADS), and reported the results of the Innodata docGenix, LLC subsidiary (docGenix) within the IADS segment. Effective with the first quarter of 2018, the results for docGenix are reported within the DDS segment. As of December 31, 2018, Innodata Inc. owned 94% of docGenix. The Company’s DDS segment specializes in combining deep neural networks and human expertise in multiple domains (including health, science, and law) to make “unstructured information” (sometimes referred to as “content”) useable. For business information companies, “useable” means that the content can be sold via subscription to a digital product . For enterprises, “useable” means that the content can drive digital process transformation and AI . The Company works with all classes of data, including sensitive and protected data. We also develop digital products for business information companies and digital systems which replace legacy systems and processes. In 2018, we continued to implement a strategy we initiated in 2017 focused on technology differentiation, increasingly taking an innovation-led approach to create value for clients while driving leaner, more cost-effective operations. The Company’s Synodex segment enables clients in the insurance and healthcare sectors to transform medical records into useable digital data and to apply technologies to the digital data to augment decision support. The main focus of the Synodex business is the extraction and classification of data from unstructured medical records in an innovative way to provide improved data service capabilities for insurance underwriting, insurance claims, medical records management, life settlement claims, and clinical trial support services. F- 7 The Company’s Synodex segment operates through the Company’s Innodata Synodex, LLC subsidiary. As of December 31, 2018, Innodata Inc. owned 92.5% of Innodata Synodex, LLC, an increase of 1.5% from June 30, 2018. As a result, the Company reduced the carrying value of the non-controlling interest in Innodata Synodex, LLC by approximately $492,000, which was charged against the Company’s additional paid-in capital. The Company’s Agility segment provides tools and related professional services that enable public relations (PR) and communications professionals to discover influencers, amplify messages, monitor coverage, and measure the impact of campaigns. Agility’s software-as-a-service (SaaS) tools include: Agility’s professional services include: Bulldog Reporter, a publisher of PR-related news and a popular e-newsletter, and the Bulldog Awards, a PR awards program that recognizes outstanding performance among PR and communications professionals and agencies, are properties of Agility. F- 8 Principles of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Innodata Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Agility PR Solutions Canada, a corporation in which the Company owns substantially all of the economic interest, and the Synodex and docGenix limited liability companies that are majority-owned by the Company. The non-controlling interests in the Synodex and docGenix limited liability companies are accounted for in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) non-controlling interest guidance. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Use of Estimates - In preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include those related to allowance for doubtful accounts and billing adjustments, long-lived assets, intangible assets, goodwill, valuation of deferred tax assets, valuation of securities underlying stock-based compensation, litigation accruals, valuation of derivative instruments and estimated accruals for various tax exposures. Revenue Recognition – Revenue is recognized when control of the promised services is transferred to a customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those services as per the agreement with the customer. We generate all our revenue from agreements with customers. In case there are agreements with multiple performance obligations, we identify each performance obligation and evaluate whether the performance obligations are distinct within the context of the agreement at the agreement’s inception. Performance obligations that are not distinct at agreement inception are combined. We allocate the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation proportionately based on the estimated standalone selling price for each performance obligation, if any, and then evaluates how the services are transferred to the customer to determine the timing of revenue recognition. On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”) and all related Accounting Standards Updates by applying the modified retrospective method to all contracts that were not completed on January 1, 2018. The modified retrospective approach required us to recognize the cumulative effect of initially applying the new standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings on January 1, 2018. Comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the historical accounting standards in effect for those periods. The adoption of the new revenue standard did not result in a cumulative effect adjustment to our retained earnings since there was no significant impact upon adoption of the new standard. There was also no material impact to revenues, or any other financial statement line items for the year ended December 31, 2018 as a result of applying ASC 606. We expect the impact of the adoption of ASC 606 to remain insignificant to the Company’s result of operations on an ongoing basis. F- 9 For the DDS segment, revenue is recognized primarily based on the quantity delivered or resources utilized in the period in which services are performed and performance conditions are satisfied as per the agreement. Revenues for agreements billed on a time-and-materials basis are recognized as services are performed. Revenues under fixed-fee agreements, which are not significant to the overall revenues, are recognized based on the proportional performance method of accounting, as services are performed, or milestones are achieved. For the Synodex segment, revenue is recognized primarily based on the quantity delivered in the period in which services are performed and performance conditions are satisfied as per the agreement. A portion of our Synodex segment revenue is derived from licensing our functional software and providing access to our hosted software platform. Revenue from such services is recognized monthly when access to the service is provided to the end user; all parties to the agreement have agreed to the agreement; each party’s rights are identifiable; the payment terms are identifiable; the agreement has commercial substance; and collection is probable. The Agility segment derives its revenue primarily from subscription arrangements and provision of enriched media analysis services. It also derives revenue as a reseller of corporate communication solutions. Revenue from subscriptions is recognized monthly when access to the service is provided to the end user; all parties to the agreement have agreed to the agreement; each party’s rights are identifiable; the payment terms are identifiable; the agreement has commercial substance; and collection is probable. Revenue from enriched media analysis services is recognized when the services are performed, and performance conditions are satisfied. Revenues from the reseller agreements, which are not significant to the overall revenues, are recognized at gross with our functioning as a principal due to our meeting the following criteria. We act as the primary obligor in the sales transaction; assume the credit risk, set the price; can select suppliers; and are involved in the execution of the services, including after sales service. Revenues include reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses, with the corresponding out-of-pocket expenses included in direct operating costs. We consider U.S. GAAP criteria for determining whether to report revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent. Factors considered include whether we are the primary obligor, have risks and rewards of ownership, and bear the risk that a client may not pay for the services performed. If there are circumstances where the above criteria are not met and therefore, we are not the principal in providing services, amounts received from clients are presented net of payments in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Contract acquisition cost for our Agility segment is amortized over the term of the subscription agreement which normally has a duration of 12 months or less. We review these costs on a periodic basis to determine the need to adjust the carrying values for pre-terminated contracts. Foreign Currency Translation - The functional currency of our production operations located in the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka and Israel is the U.S. dollar. Transactions denominated in the Philippine pesos, Indian and Sri Lankan rupees or Israeli shekels are translated to U.S. dollars at rates which approximate those in effect on the transaction dates. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at December 31, 2018 and 2017 are translated at the exchange rate in effect as of those dates. Nonmonetary assets, liabilities, and stockholders’ equity were translated at the appropriate historical rates. Included in direct operating costs are exchange losses (gains) resulting from such transactions of approximately ($201,000) and $466,000 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. F- 10 The functional currency for our subsidiaries in Germany, the United Kingdom and Canada are the Euro, the Pound Sterling and the Canadian dollar, respectively. The financial statements of these subsidiaries are reported in these respective currencies. Financial information is translated from the applicable functional currency to the U.S. dollar (the reporting currency) for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. Income, expenses and cash flows are translated at weighted average exchange rates prevailing during the fiscal period, and assets and liabilities are translated at fiscal period-end exchange rates. Resulting translation adjustments are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity. Foreign exchange transaction gains or losses are included in direct operating costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The amount of foreign currency translation adjustment was ($779,000) and $706,000 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Derivative Instruments - The Company has designated its derivatives (foreign currency forward contracts) as a cash flow hedge. Accordingly, the effective portion of the derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and is subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedge exposure affects earnings. The Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedging activities. There were no outstanding foreign currency forward contracts at December 31, 2018. Cash Equivalents - For financial statement purposes (including cash flows), the Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Property and Equipment - Property and equipment are stated at cost and are depreciated on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which is generally two to five years. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the lives of the leases. Certain assets under capital leases are amortized over the lives of the respective leases or the estimated useful lives of the assets, whichever is shorter. Leases - The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate in the assessment of lease classification as capital or operating and defines the initial lease term to include renewal options determined to be reasonably assured. The majority of our leases are operating leases. See “Recent Accounting Pronouncement on Leases.” Long-lived Assets - Management assesses the recoverability of its long-lived assets, which consist primarily of fixed assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The following factors, if present, may trigger an impairment review: (i) significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results; (ii) significant negative industry or economic trends; (iii) significant decline in the Company’s stock price for a sustained period; and (iv) a change in the Company’s market capitalization relative to net book value. If the recoverability of these assets is unlikely because of the existence of one or more of the above-mentioned factors, an impairment analysis is performed, initially using a projected undiscounted cash flow method. Management makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of these respective assets. An impairment loss will be recognized only if the carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable, exceeds its fair value, and is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair value. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets – The Company performs valuations of assets acquired and liabilities assumed on each acquisition accounted for as a business combination and allocates the purchase price of each acquired business to its respective net tangible and intangible assets and liabilities. Acquired intangible assets principally consist of technology, customer relationships, backlog and trademarks. Liabilities related to intangibles principally consist of unfavorable vendor contracts. The Company determines the appropriate useful life by performing an analysis of expected cash flows based on projected financial information of the acquired businesses. Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method, which approximates the pattern in which the majority of the economic benefits are expected to be consumed. Intangible liabilities are amortized into direct operating costs ratably over their expected related revenue streams over their useful lives. F- 11 Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the fair value of the acquired net assets. The Company does not amortize goodwill but evaluates it for impairment at the reporting unit level annually during the third quarter of each fiscal year (as of September 30th of that quarter) or when an event occurs, or circumstance changes, that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. In 2018, the Company adopted Accounting Standard Update (ASU) 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Accounting for Goodwill Impairment. Under the newly adopted guidance, the optional qualitative assessment, referred to as “Step 0”, and the first step of the quantitative assessment (“Step 1”) remained unchanged compared to the prior guidance. However, the requirement to complete the second step (“Step 2”), which involved determining the implied fair value of goodwill and comparing it to the carrying value of that goodwill to measure the impairment loss, was eliminated. As a result, Step 1 will be used to determine both the existence and amount of goodwill impairment. An impairment loss will be recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill in that reporting unit. The Company periodically analyzes whether any indicators of impairment have occurred. As part of these periodic analyses, the Company compares its estimated fair value, as determined based on its stock price, to its net book value. Due to a continuing decline in its stock price and other indicators of impairment that arose during the second quarter of 2018, the Company deemed it appropriate to assess goodwill impairment as of June 30, 2018, rather than the historical testing date of September 30. Based on its assessment the Company concluded that the goodwill of the DDS segment, amounting to $675,000, was fully impaired. Refer to Note 3, “Goodwill and Intangible Assets”. The Company conducted its annual goodwill impairment test for the Agility segment as of September 30, 2018. The estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, including goodwill, and the Company concluded that there is no impairment of the goodwill of the Agility segment. Income Taxes - Deferred taxes are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates, as well as any net operating loss or tax credit carryforwards expected to reduce taxes payable in future years. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. While the Company considers future taxable income in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event that the Company determines that it would be able to realize the deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made. Similarly, in the event that the Company determines that it would not be able to realize the deferred tax assets in the future considering future taxable income, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would decrease income in the period such determination was made. Changes in the valuation allowance from period to period are included in the Company’s tax provision in the period of change. The Company indefinitely reinvests the foreign earnings in its foreign subsidiaries. Unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries have been included in the consolidated financial statements without giving effect to the United States taxes that may be payable on distribution to the United States, because such earnings are not anticipated to be remitted to the United States. In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considered whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the U.S. and Canadian deferred tax assets will not be realizable. As the expectation of future taxable income resulting from Synodex and Agility segments cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company maintains a valuation allowance against all the U.S. and Canadian deferred tax assets. The Company accounts for income taxes regarding uncertain tax positions, and recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - The Company measures and recognizes stock-based compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors based on the estimated fair value at the grant date. The stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period. The fair value is determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. F- 12 The stock-based compensation expense related to the Company’s stock plan was allocated as follows (in thousands): Fair Value of Financial Instruments - The carrying amounts of financial instruments approximated their fair value as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, because of the relative short maturity of these instruments. See Note 14. Fair value measurements and disclosures define fair value as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The accounting standard establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels. The three levels are defined as follows: Accounts Receivable - The Company establishes credit terms for new clients based upon management’s review of their credit information and project terms, and performs ongoing credit evaluations of its clients, adjusting credit terms when management believes appropriate based upon payment history and an assessment of the client’s current creditworthiness. The Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its clients to make required payments. The Company determines its allowance by considering a number of factors, including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due (accounts outstanding longer than the payment terms are considered past due), the Company’s previous loss history, the client’s current ability to pay its obligation to the Company, and the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole. This cannot guarantee that credit loss rates in the future will not be greater than those experienced in the past. In addition, there is credit exposure if the financial condition of one of the Company’s major clients were to deteriorate. In the event that the financial condition of one of the Company’s clients were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be necessary. Our allowance for doubtful accounts as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 was approximately $1.0 million and $1.2 million, respectively. Concentration of Credit Risk - The Company maintains its cash with highly rated financial institutions, located in the United States and in foreign locations where the Company has its operations. At December 31, 2018, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $10.9 million, of which $5.6 million was held by its foreign subsidiaries with local banks located mainly in Asia and $5.3 million was held in the United States. To the extent that such cash exceeds the maximum insurance levels, the Company would be uninsured. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts. F- 13 Income (loss) per Share – Income (loss) per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted income (loss) per share is computed by considering the impact of the potential issuance of common shares, using the treasury stock method, on the weighted average number of shares outstanding. For those securities that are not convertible into a class of common stock, the “two class” method of computing income (loss) per share is used. Pension - The Company records annual pension costs based on calculations, which include various actuarial assumptions including discount rates, compensation increases and other assumptions involving demographic factors. The Company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends. The Company believes that the assumptions used in recording its pension obligations are reasonable based on its experience, market conditions and inputs from its actuaries. Deferred Revenue - Deferred revenue represents payments received from clients in advance of providing services and amounts deferred if conditions for revenue recognition have not been met. Included in accrued expenses on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 is deferred revenue amounting to $1.1 million and $1.3 million, respectively. Certain amounts in the 2017 consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the 2018 presentation. Recent Accounting Pronouncements – On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”) and all related Accounting Standards Updates by applying the modified retrospective method to all contracts that were not completed on January 1, 2018. The modified retrospective approach required us to recognize the cumulative effect of initially applying the new standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings on January 1, 2018. Comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the historical accounting standards in effect for those periods. The adoption of the new revenue standard did not result in a cumulative effect adjustment to our retained earnings since there was no significant impact upon adoption of the new standard. There was also no material impact to revenues, or any other financial statement line items for the year ended December 31, 2018 as a result of applying ASC 606. We expect the impact of the adoption of ASC 606 to remain insignificant to the Company’s results of operations on an ongoing basis. In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance related to leases. This new guidance requires lessees to recognize on the balance sheet a right-of-use asset, representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term, and a lease liability for all leases with terms greater than twelve months. The guidance also requires qualitative and quantitative disclosures designed to assess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The standard requires the use of a modified retrospective transition approach, which includes a number of optional practical expedients that entities may elect to apply. This new guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. We adopted this guidance on January 1, 2019 and are electing the package of practical expedients, which, among other things, allows us to carry forward our prior lease classifications under ASC 840. At adoption, the Company expects to recognize right of use assets of approximately $8 million and related lease liabilities of $9 million on its consolidated balance sheet for its operating leases. We do not expect ASU 2016-02 to have a material impact on our annual results of operations and/or cash flows. In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments – Overall (“Subtopic 825-10”): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (“ASU 2016-01”), which updates certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-01 in its first quarter of 2019 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. Based on the composition of the Company’s investment portfolio, the adoption of ASU 2016-01 is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. F- 14 In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-14, “Compensation-Retirement Benefits-Defined Benefit Plans-General: Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans” (“ASU 2018-14”) that makes minor changes to the disclosure requirements for employers that sponsor defined benefit pension and/or other postretirement benefit plans. The guidance eliminates requirements for certain disclosures that are no longer considered cost beneficial and adds new disclosure requirements that the FASB considers pertinent. ASU 2018-14 is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2020 for public entities. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of the Update on our financial statements, but do not expect it to have a material impact. Correction of Immaterial Error – During the preparation of the 2018 consolidated financial statements, the Company identified a cumulative error in accounting for pension expense under ASC 715, resulting in an immaterial understatement of pension liabilities and overstatement of retained earnings. The cumulative error resulted from the cumulative effect of under-recorded pension expense from December 31, 2008 through December 31, 2013 with respect to the Company’s DDS segment. On a year to year basis, the under-recorded pension expense did not have a significant impact on the consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The cumulative error resulted in an understatement of pension liabilities and an overstatement of retained earnings, each by an aggregate amount of $269,000. In accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 99, Materiality , and SAB No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Stateme nts, management evaluated the materiality of the cumulative error on the current year and affected prior year financial statements from both a qualitative and quantitative perspective. Based on this analysis, the Company concluded that correcting the cumulative error would be immaterial to the current year financial statements and that such cumulative error does not have a material impact on the periods in which the pension expenses were under-recorded or the intervening periods. The correction of the cumulative error was recorded in the 2018 consolidated financial statements. The $700,000 in recorded pension expense for 2018 includes the $269,000 of prior under-recorded pension expense and the $2.5 million of pension liability as of December 31, 2018 includes the $269,000 of prior under-recorded pension liability. The aggregate effect of the out-of-period correction was a reduction of net income of $269,000. Property and equipment, which include amounts recorded under capital leases, are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization (in thousands), and consist of the following: Depreciation and amortization expense of property and equipment was approximately $2.2 million and $2.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Total assets financed under capital leases for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were $0.2 million and $0.8 million, respectively. F- 15 The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 were as follows (in thousands): The Company recorded a full goodwill impairment of $675,000 for its DDS segment as of June 30, 2018. The Company periodically analyzes whether any indicators of impairment have occurred. As part of these periodic analyses, the Company compares its estimated fair value, as determined based on its stock price, to its net book value. The continued decline in the Company’s stock price was viewed by the Company as a triggering event under ASU 2017-04 which required an assessment for possible goodwill impairment as of June 30, 2018. Under the provisions of ASU 2017-04, which the Company opted to early adopt, goodwill impairment is recognized based on Step 1 of the current guidance, which calculates the carrying value in excess of the reporting unit’s fair value. The Company performed this assessment as of June 30, 2018 and determined that the fair value of the Agility segment exceeded its carrying value, but the fair value of the DDS segment was below its carrying value. As a result, the Company recorded a full goodwill impairment of $675,000 for the DDS segment reporting unit as of June 30, 2018. The Company performed its annual goodwill assessment for the Agility segment as of September 30, 2018 and reached the conclusion that there is no goodwill impairment because the Agility segment’s fair value exceeded its carrying value. The fair value measurement of goodwill was classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy because the income approach was used, which utilizes significant inputs that are unobservable in the market. The Company believes it made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of the reporting unit as of the impairment test measurement date. F- 16 Information regarding our acquisition-related intangible assets is as follows (in thousands): Amortization expense relating to acquisition-related intangible assets was approximately $1.0 million for both years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. Estimated annual amortization expense for intangible assets subsequent to December 31, 2018 is as follows (in thousands): In December 2017, the President signed the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (2017 Tax Act), which includes a broad range of provisions, many of which significantly differ from those contained in previous U.S. tax law. Changes in tax law are accounted for in the period of enactment. As such, the 2017 consolidated financial statements reflect the immediate tax effect of the 2017 Tax Act, which was enacted on December 22, 2017 (Enactment Date). The 2017 Tax Act contains several key provisions including, among other things: F- 17 Pursuant to the 2017 Tax Act, we recorded the following adjustments to income tax expense during the fourth quarter of 2017: Beginning January 1, 2018, the Company performed a calculation of the GILTI provisions and concluded that it has no impact on account of the net losses of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries. The significant components of the provision for income taxes for the two years ended December 31, 2018 are as follows (in thousands): F- 18 The reconciliation of the U.S. statutory rate with the Company’s effective tax rate for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2018 is summarized as follows: Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current. Significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 are as follows (in thousands): In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realizable. The ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences are deductible and net operating losses are available. As of December 31, 2018, the Company continues to maintain a valuation allowance on all U.S. and Canadian deferred tax assets. F- 19 The Company established a valuation allowance of approximately $6.1 million and $5.4 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The valuation allowance relates to U.S. deferred tax assets and the Company’s Canadian subsidiaries. The net change in the total valuation allowance was an increase of $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to a decrease of $5.1 million in December 31, 2017. The decrease in the valuation allowance in 2017 is primarily the result of the 2017 Tax Act. Despite the access to the overseas earnings and the resulting toll charge, the Company intends to indefinitely reinvest the foreign earnings in its foreign subsidiaries on account of the foreign jurisdiction withholding tax that the Company would have to incur on the actual remittances. Unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries amounted to approximately $21.0 million at December 31, 2018. If such earnings are repatriated in the future, or are no longer deemed to be indefinitely reinvested, the Company would have to accrue the applicable amount of foreign jurisdiction withholding taxes associated with such remittances. The 2017 Tax Act imposes a mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and eliminates U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiary distribution. Due to the one-time transition tax on the deemed repatriation of post-1986 undistributed foreign subsidiary earnings and profits, all previously unremitted earnings for which no U.S. deferred tax liability had been accrued have now been subjected to U.S. federal income tax. As a result, earnings in foreign jurisdictions are available for distribution to the U.S. without incremental U.S. taxes. To the extent the Company repatriates these earnings to the United States, it estimates that it will not incur significant additional taxes related to such amounts, however the estimates are provisional and subject to further analysis. United States and foreign components of income (loss) before provision for income taxes for each of the two years ended December 31, (in thousands) are as follows: The Company’s Canadian subsidiaries claim deductions of eligible research and development expenses within the Scientific Research and Experimental Development (SR&ED) Program, a federal tax incentive program, administered by the Canada Revenue Agency. Amounts recorded for the federal and provincial research and development tax credits aggregated $0.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Such amounts have been recorded as a reduction in selling and administrative expenses. At December 31, 2018, the Company has available U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $14.8 million. These net operating loss carryforwards expire at various times through the year 2035. At December 31, 2018, the Company’s Canadian subsidiaries have available net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $9.3 million in Canada which begin to expire in 2028. In addition, these subsidiaries also have research and development expenditures of approximately $1.5 million available to reduce taxable income in future years which may be carried forward indefinitely. The potential benefits from these balances have not been recognized for financial statement purposes. The Company had unrecognized tax benefits of $2.4 million and $2.2 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The portion of unrecognized tax benefits relating to interest and penalties was $0.1 million and $0.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, if recognized, would have an impact on the Company’s effective tax rate. F- 20 The following table represents a roll forward of the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits and associated interest for the years ended (amounts in thousands): The Company is subject to Federal income tax, as well as income tax in various states and foreign jurisdictions. The Company has open periods for US Federal and state taxes from 2014 through 2018. Various foreign subsidiaries currently have open tax years from 2003 through 2018. Tax Assessments In October 2010, the Company’s Indian subsidiary received an assessment from the Indian Income Tax Department for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006. Management disagrees with the basis of this tax assessment, has filed an appeal against the assessment and is contesting it. Management believes that its recorded tax liability of $329,000 for this matter, which includes interest, is adequate. In January 2012, the Company’s Indian subsidiary received an assessment from the Indian Income Tax Department for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008. Management disagrees with the basis of this tax assessment and successfully appealed the assessment. The income tax assessing officer has filed an appeal against the decision entered in favor of the subsidiary. Management is contesting the appeal filed by the assessing officer. Management believes that its recorded tax liability of $343,000 for this matter, which includes interest, is adequate. In September 2015, the Company’s Indian subsidiary was subject to an inquiry by the Service Tax Department in India regarding the classification of services provided by this subsidiary, asserting that the services provided by this subsidiary fall under the category of online information and database access or retrieval services (OID Services), and not under the category of business support services (BS Services) that are exempt from service tax as historically indicated in the subsidiary’s service tax filings. Management disagrees with the Service Tax Department’s position and is vigorously contesting these assertions. In the event the Service Tax Department is successful in proving that the services fall under the category of OID Services, the revenues earned by the Company’s Indian subsidiary for the period July 2012 through November 2016 would be subject to a service tax of between 12.36% and 15%. The revenue of our Indian subsidiary during this period was approximately $67.0 million. In accordance with new rules promulgated by the Service Tax Department, as of December 1, 2016 service tax is no longer applicable to OID or BS Services. Based on the assessment of the Company’s counsel, the Company has not recorded any tax liability for this case. In October 2016, the Company’s Indian subsidiary received notices of appeal from the Indian Service Tax Department in India seeking to reverse service tax refunds of approximately $160,000 previously granted to our Indian subsidiary for three quarters in 2014, asserting that the services provided by this subsidiary fall under the category of OID Services and not BS Services. The appeal was determined in favor of the Service Tax Department. Management disagrees with the basis of this decision and is contesting it vigorously. The Company expects delays in its Indian subsidiary receiving further service tax refunds until this matter is adjudicated with finality, and currently has service tax credits of approximately $1.0 million recorded as a receivable. Based on the assessment of the Company’s counsel, the Company has not recorded any tax liability for this case. F- 21 The Company has recorded a tax provision amounting to $181,000, which includes interest, for several ongoing tax proceedings in the Philippines. Although the ultimate outcome cannot be determined at this time, the Company continues to contest these claims vigorously. Certain amounts in the 2017 income tax disclosures were reclassified to conform to the 2018 presentation. There was no effect on the Company’s current income tax expense or net deferred tax assets. Total long-term obligations as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 consist of the following (in thousands): (1) Deferred lease payments represent the effect of straight-lining operating lease payments over the respective lease terms. (2) In March 2017, the Company renewed a vendor agreement to acquire certain additional software licenses and to receive support and subsequent software upgrades on these and other currently owned software licenses through February 2020. Pursuant to this agreement, the Company is obligated to pay approximately $0.4 million annually over the term of the agreement. The total cost, net of deferred interest (in thousands), was allocated to the following asset accounts in 2017: F- 22 (3) On September 30, 2016, the Company and the other parties to the transaction in which the Company acquired MediaMiser Ltd. amended the terms on which a subsidiary of the Company is required to make a supplemental purchase price payment for MediaMiser Ltd. MediaMiser Ltd. is now known as Agility PR Solutions Canada Ltd. Prior to the amendment, the amount of the supplemental purchase price payment was to be determined by the achievement of certain financial thresholds and was in no event to exceed $3.8 million (C$5 million). The amendment fixed the amount of the supplemental purchase price payment at $1.5 million (C$2 million) payable in two equal installments on March 31, 2017 and 2018 to designated recipients, except that no payments will be made to designated recipients who fail to satisfy specified conditions. The Company had the option to pay up to 70% of the supplemental amount in shares of Innodata Inc. stock. In March 2017, the Company paid 70% of the first installment by issuing 253,622 shares of Innodata Inc.’s common stock and paid 30% of the first installment in cash in April 2017. The Company paid the entire second installment in cash in April 2018. (4) In the second quarter of 2017, the Company relocated its U.S. and Canadian headquarters to new premises. As a financial incentive for the Company to lease office space in each of the new locations, the respective lessor for each of the locations offered to partially defray the construction cost for the new office space by offering tenant improvement allowances, subject to the Company refunding any unamortized portion of the allowance under specified circumstances as set forth in each lease. These amounts will be amortized based on the contractual lease term and recognized as a reduction in rent expense for the periods covered. (5) Represents payment to be made pursuant to a settlement agreement entered into between a subsidiary of the Company and 19 former employees of such subsidiary in December of 2018. $168,000 was paid in January 2019 and $842,000 will be paid in 48 monthly installments commencing April 2019. Leases - The Company is obligated under various operating lease agreements for office and production space. Certain agreements contain escalation clauses and requirements that the Company pay taxes, insurance and maintenance costs. Company leases that include escalated lease payments are expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease period. Lease agreements for production space in most overseas facilities, which expire through 2030, contain provisions pursuant to which the Company may cancel the leases subject to a notice period, and generally subject to forfeiture of the security deposit. Rent expense, principally for office and production space totaled approximately $2.3 million and $2.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable leases, by year and in the aggregate, as of December 31, 2018 (in thousands) are as follows: F- 23 Litigation – In 2008, a judgment was rendered in the Philippines against a Philippines subsidiary of the Company that is no longer active and purportedly also against Innodata Inc., in favor of certain former employees of the Philippines subsidiary. The payment amount aggregates approximately $6.2 million, plus legal interest that accrued at 12% per annum from August 13, 2008 to June 30, 2013, and thereafter accrued and continues to accrue at 6% per annum. The payment amount as expressed in U.S. dollars varies with the Philippine peso to U.S. dollar exchange rate. In December 2017 a group of 97 of the former employees indicated that they proposed to record the judgment as to them in New Jersey. In January 2018, in response to an action initiated by Innodata Inc., the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey (the “USDC”) entered a preliminary injunction that enjoins these former employees from pursuing or seeking recognition or enforcement of the judgment against Innodata Inc. in the United States during the pendency of the action and until further order of the Court. In June 2018, the USDC entered a consent order administratively closing the action subject to return of the action to the active docket upon the written request of Innodata Inc. or the former employees, with the USDC retaining jurisdiction over the matter and the preliminary injunction remaining in full force and effect. The Company is also subject to various other legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business. While management currently believes that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position or overall trends in consolidated results of operations, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties. Substantial recovery against the Company in the above-referenced Philippines action could have a material adverse impact on the Company, and unfavorable rulings or recoveries in the other proceedings could have a material adverse impact on the consolidated operating results of the period in which the ruling or recovery occurs. In addition, the Company’s estimate of potential impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position or overall consolidated results of operations for the above referenced legal proceedings could change in the future. The Company’s legal reserves related to legal proceedings and claims are based on a determination of whether or not a loss is probable. The Company reviews outstanding proceedings and claims with external counsel to assess probability and estimates of loss. The reserves are adjusted if necessary. While the Company intends to defend these matters vigorously, adverse outcomes that it estimates could reach approximately $275,000 in the aggregate beyond recorded amounts are reasonably possible. If circumstances change, the Company may be required to record adjustments that could be material to its reported consolidated financial condition and results of operations. Foreign Currency - To the extent that the currencies of the Company’s production facilities located in the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka and Israel fluctuate, the Company is subject to risks of changing costs of production after pricing is established for certain client projects. In addition, the Company is exposed to the risk of foreign currency fluctuation on the non-U.S. dollar denominated revenues, and on the monetary assets and liabilities held by its foreign subsidiaries that are denominated in local currency. Indemnifications - The Company is obligated under certain circumstances to indemnify directors, certain officers and employees against costs and liabilities incurred in actions or threatened actions brought against such individuals because such individuals acted in the capacity of director, officer or fiduciary of the Company. In addition, the Company has contracts with certain clients pursuant to which the Company has agreed to indemnify the client for certain specified and limited claims. These indemnification obligations occur in the ordinary course of business and, in many cases, do not include a limit on potential maximum future payments. As of December 31, 2018, the Company has not recorded a liability for any obligations arising as a result of these indemnifications. U.S. Defined Contribution Pension Plan - The Company has a defined contribution plan qualified under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, pursuant to which substantially all of its U.S. employees are eligible to participate after completing six months of service. Participants may elect to contribute a portion of their compensation to the plan. Under the plan, the Company has the discretion to match a portion of participants’ contributions. The Company intends to match approximately $0.1 million to the plan for the year ended December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company did not make any matching contributions. F- 24 Non-U.S. Pension benefits - The accounting standard for pensions requires an employer to recognize a net liability or asset and an offsetting adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss to report the funded status of defined benefit pension and other post-retirement benefit plans. Most of the non-U.S. subsidiaries provide for government-mandated defined pension benefits. For certain of these subsidiaries, vested eligible employees are provided a lump sum payment upon retiring from the Company at a defined age. The lump sum amount is based on the salary and tenure as of retirement date. Other non-U.S. subsidiaries provide for a lump sum payment to vested employees on retirement, death, incapacitation or termination of employment, based upon the salary and tenure as of the date employment ceases. The liability for such defined benefit obligations is determined and provided on the basis of actuarial valuations. As of December 31, 2018, these plans are unfunded. Pension expense for foreign subsidiaries totaled approximately $0.7 million and $0.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Included in the $0.7 million pension expense for the year ended 2018 is $269,000 representing the correction of an understatement of pension liabilities from prior years. The following table summarizes the amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes (in thousands): F- 25 The following table sets out the status of the non-U.S. pension benefits and the amounts (in thousands) recognized in the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of and for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2018: Benefit Obligations: Components of Net Periodic Pension Cost: The accumulated benefit obligation, which represents benefits earned to date, was approximately $1.7 million and $2.0 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets for the years ended December 31 consist of the following: Current accrued benefit cost for pension benefits is included in the current portion of long-term obligations in the consolidated balance sheets. Non-current accrued benefit cost for pension benefits is included in long-term obligations, net of current portion, in the consolidated balance sheets. Actuarial assumptions for all non-U.S. plans are described below. The discount rates are used to measure the year end benefit obligations and the earnings effects for the subsequent year. The assumptions for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2018 are as follows: F- 26 Estimated Future Benefit Payments: The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid (in thousands): Common Stock - The Company is authorized to issue 75,000,000 shares of common stock. Each share of common stock has one vote. Subject to preferences that may be applicable to any outstanding shares of preferred stock, the holders of common stock are entitled to receive ratably such dividends, if any, as may be declared by the Board of Directors. No common stock dividends have been declared to date. Preferred Stock - The Company is authorized to issue 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The Board of Directors is authorized to fix the terms, rights, preferences and limitations of the preferred stock and to issue the preferred stock in series which differ as to their relative terms, rights, preferences and limitations. Stockholders Rights Agreement - On February 1, 2019, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right (each, a “Right,” and collectively, the “Rights”) for each outstanding share of the Company’s common stock on February 15, 2019. The description and terms of the Rights are set forth in a Rights Agreement between the Company and American Stock Transfer & Trust Co., as rights agent, dated as of February 1, 2019 (the “Rights Agreement”). Each Right entitles its holder to purchase, under certain conditions, one one-thousandth of a share of Series C Participating Preferred Stock (“Preferred Stock”). Each one one-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock has substantially the same rights as one share of the Company’s common stock. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Rights Agreement, Rights become exercisable ten days after the public announcement that a “Person” has become an “Acquiring Person” (as each such term is defined in the Rights Agreement) by obtaining beneficial ownership of 20% or more of the Company’s outstanding common stock, or, if earlier, ten business days (or a later date determined by the Board of Directors before any Person becomes an Acquiring Person) after a Person begins a tender or exchange offer which, if completed, would result in that Person becoming an Acquiring Person. Any Rights held by an Acquiring Person are void and may not be exercised. If a Person becomes an Acquiring Person, all holders of Rights, except the Acquiring Person, may purchase at the Right’s then-current exercise price, the Company’s common stock having a market value equal to twice the exercise price. Moreover, at any time after a Person becomes an Acquiring Person (unless such Person acquires 50 percent or more of the common stock of the Company then outstanding, as more fully described in the Rights Agreement), the Board of Directors may exchange one share of the Company’s common stock for each outstanding Right (other than rights owned by such Person, which would have become void). In addition, if the Company is acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction after a Person becomes an Acquiring Person, all holders of Rights, except the Acquiring Person, may purchase at the Right’s then-current exercise price, a number of the acquiring Company’s common stock having a market value of twice the exercise price. If the Company receives a “qualifying offer” (which includes certain all-cash fully financed tender offers or exchange offers for all of the Company’s outstanding common stock), under certain circumstances, holders of 10 percent of the Company’s outstanding common stock (excluding stock held by the offeror and its affiliates and associates) may direct the Board of Directors to call a special meeting of stockholders to consider a resolution exempting such “qualifying offer” from the Rights Agreement. The Rights themselves have no voting power. The Board of Directors may redeem the Rights at an initial redemption price of $0.001 per Right under certain circumstances set forth in the Rights Agreement. F- 27 If the Rights Agreement is approved by the Company’s stockholders at the 2019 annual meeting, the Rights will expire on January 31, 2022 unless earlier redeemed or exchanged. If the Company’s stockholders do not approve the Rights Agreement, the Rights will expire immediately following certification of the vote at the 2019 annual meeting. Common Stock Reserved - As of December 31, 2018, the Company had reserved for issuance approximately 5,352,000 shares of common stock pursuant to the Company’s stock option plans. Treasury Stock - In September 2011, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2.0 million of its common stock in open market or private transactions. There is no expiration date associated with the program. There were no share repurchases in the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. As of December 31, 2018, the Company repurchased 137,000 shares of its common stock under the September 2011 authorization. On June 7, 2016, stockholders of the Company approved amendments to the Innodata Inc. 2013 Stock Plan. The Innodata Inc. 2013 Stock Plan as amended and restated effective June 7, 2016 is referred to herein as the “Plan.” The number of shares of common stock of Innodata Inc. that may be delivered, purchased or used for reference purposes (with respect to stock appreciation rights or stock units) for awards granted under the Plan after June 7, 2016 is 5,858,892 (the “Share Reserve”). Shares subject to an option or stock appreciation right granted under the Plan after June 7, 2016 shall count against the Share Reserve as one share for every share granted, and shares subject to any other type of award granted under the Plan after June 7, 2016 shall count against the Share Reserve as two shares for every share granted. Any award, or portion of an award, under the Plan or under the 2009 Stock Plan (as amended and restated (the “Prior Plan”)) that expires or terminates unexercised, becomes unexercisable or is forfeited or otherwise terminated, surrendered or canceled as to any shares without delivery of shares or other consideration shall be added back to the Share Reserve as one share for each such share that was subject to an option or stock appreciation right granted under the Plan or the Prior Plan, and two shares for each such share that was subject to an award other than an option or stock appreciation right granted under the Plan or the Prior Plan. If any shares are withheld, tendered or exchanged by a participant in the Plan as full or partial payment to Innodata of the exercise price under an option under the Plan or the Prior Plan or in satisfaction of a participant’s tax withholding obligations with respect to any award under the Plan or the Prior Plan, there shall be added back to the Share Reserve one share for each such share that was withheld, tendered or exchanged in respect of an option or stock appreciation right granted under the Plan or the Prior Plan, and two shares for each such share that was withheld, tendered or exchanged in respect of an award other than an option or stock appreciation right granted under the Plan or the Prior Plan. F- 28 The fair value of stock options is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The weighted average fair values of the options granted and weighted average assumptions are as follows: The Company estimates the risk-free interest rate using the U.S. Treasury yield curve for periods equal to the expected term of the options in effect at the time of grant. The expected term of options granted is based on a combination of vesting schedules, term of the options and historical experience. Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the Company’s common stock. The Company uses an expected dividend yield of zero since it has never declared or paid any dividends on its capital stock. A summary of option activity under the Plans as of December 31, 2018, and changes during the year then ended, are presented below: The total compensation cost related to non-vested stock options not yet recognized as of December 31, 2018 totaled approximately $1 million. The weighted-average period over which these costs will be recognized is twenty-seven months. There were no option exercises during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. F- 29 Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), as reflected in the consolidated balance sheets, consists of pension liability adjustments, net of taxes, foreign currency translation adjustment and changes in fair value of derivatives, net of taxes. The components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and reclassifications out of other comprehensive income (loss) for the years then ended, are presented below (in thousands): All reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) had an impact on direct operating costs in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The Company’s operations are classified in three reporting segments: Digital Data Solutions (DDS), Synodex and Agility PR Solutions (Agility). Prior to the first quarter of 2018, the Company referred to the Agility segment as Media Intelligence Solutions (MIS) and the Synodex segment as Innodata Advanced Data Solutions (IADS), and reported the results of the Innodata docGenix, LLC subsidiary (docGenix) within the IADS segment. Effective with the first quarter of 2018, the results for docGenix are reported within the DDS segment. The DDS segment specializes in combining deep neural networks and human expertise in multiple domains (including health, science, and law) to make “unstructured information” (sometimes referred to as “content”) useable. For business information companies, “useable” means that the content can be sold via subscription to a digital product . For enterprises, “useable” means that the content can drive digital process transformation and AI . The Company works with all classes of data, including sensitive and protected data. The Synodex segment enables clients in the insurance and healthcare sectors to transform medical records into useable digital data and to apply technologies to the digital data to augment decision support. The Agility segment provides tools and related professional services that enable public relations (PR) and communications professionals to discover influencers, amplify messages, monitor coverage, and measure the impact of campaigns. Bulldog Reporter, a publisher of PR-related news and a popular e-newsletter, and the Bulldog Awards, a PR awards program that recognizes outstanding performance among PR and communications professionals and agencies, are properties of Agility. A significant portion of the Company’s revenues is generated from its production facilities in the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka, Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom and Israel. F- 30 Revenues from external clients and segment operating profit (loss), and other reportable segment information are as follows (in thousands): The results below for the year ended December 31, 2017 are presented on a reclassified basis as if for the full year 2017 docGenix had been included in the DDS segment and the Synodex segment had solely included the results of Synodex. docGenix revenue was $531,000 and $1,087,000 for years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. (1) Before elimination of any inter-segment profits (2) After elimination of any inter-segment profits F- 31 Long-lived assets as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 by geographic region are comprised of: Two clients in the DDS segment generated approximately 30% of the Company’s total revenues in the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. No other client accounted for 10% or more of total revenues during these periods. Further, in the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, revenues from non-US clients accounted for 56% and 51%, respectively, of the Company's revenues. Revenues for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2018 by geographic region (determined based upon client’s domicile), are as follows: As of December 31, 2018, approximately 57% of the Company's accounts receivable was due from foreign (principally European) clients and 48% of accounts receivable was due from three clients. As of December 31, 2017, approximately 61% of the Company's accounts receivable was due from foreign (principally European) clients and 52% of accounts receivable was due from three clients. No other client accounts for 10% or more of the receivables as of December 31, 2018. F- 32 Basic income (loss) per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted income (loss) per share is computed by considering the impact of the potential issuance of common shares, using the treasury stock method, on the weighted average number of shares outstanding. For those securities that are not convertible into a class of common stock, the two-class method of computing income (loss) per share is used. Options to purchase 3.0 million shares of common stock in 2018 were outstanding but not included in the computation of diluted income per share because the options’ exercise price was greater than the average market price of the common shares and therefore, the effect would have been antidilutive. Options to purchase 4.2 million shares of common stock in 2017 were outstanding but not included in the computation of diluted loss per share due to the net loss incurred for the year, and the effect would have been antidilutive. The Company conducts a large portion of its operations in international markets that subject it to foreign currency fluctuations. The most significant foreign currency exposures occur when revenue and associated accounts receivable are collected in one currency and expenses to generate that revenue are incurred in another currency. The Company’s primary exchange rate exposure relates to payroll, other payroll costs and operating expenses in the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka and Israel. In addition, although most of the Company’s revenues are denominated in U.S. dollars, a significant portion of the total revenues is denominated in Canadian dollars, Pound Sterling and Euros. The Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking hedge transactions. The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. All derivatives are recognized at their fair value and classified based on the instrument’s maturity date. As of December 31, 2018, we had no outstanding forward contracts. The total notional amount for outstanding derivatives as of December 31, 2017 was $15.9 million. F- 33 The following table presents the fair value of derivative instruments included within the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands): The effect of foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges on the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were as follows (in thousands): (1) Net change in fair value of the effective portion classified into other comprehensive income (""OCI"") (2) Effective portion classified within direct operating costs (3) There were no ineffective portions for the period presented. The carrying amounts of financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximated their fair value as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, because of the relative short maturity of these instruments. “ Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ” defines fair value as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The accounting standard establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels. The three levels are defined as follows: · Level 1 : Unadjusted quoted price in active market for identical assets and liabilities. · Level 2: Observable inputs other than those included in Level 1. · Level 3: Unobservable inputs reflecting management’s own assumptions about the inputs used in pricing the asset or liability.

BUSINESS Overview We are one of the largest global real estate investment trusts and a leading independent owner, operator and developer of multitenant communications real estate. Our primary business is the leasing of space on communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, wireless data providers, government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries. We refer to this business as our property operations, which accounted for 98% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022. We also offer tower-related services in the United States, which we refer to as our services operations. These services include site application, zoning and permitting, structural analysis and construction management, which primarily support our site leasing business, including the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites. Our customers include our tenants, licensees and other payers. Since inception, we have grown our communications real estate portfolio through acquisitions, long-term lease arrangements and site development. Our portfolio primarily consists of towers that we own and towers that we operate pursuant to long-term lease arrangements, as well as distributed antenna system (“DAS”) networks, which provide seamless coverage solutions in certain in-building and outdoor wireless environments. In addition to the communications sites in our portfolio, we manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements. We also hold other telecommunications infrastructure, fiber and property interests that we lease primarily to communications service providers and third-party tower operators, and, as discussed further below, we hold a portfolio of highly interconnected data center facilities and related assets in the United States that we lease primarily to enterprises, network operators, cloud providers and supporting service providers. In 2022, we launched operations in New Zealand through the acquisition of land under carrier or other third-party communications sites from Clearspan Pty Ltd for total consideration of approximately 50.1 million New Zealand Dollars (approximately $28.7 million at the date of closing). As of December 31, 2022, our communications real estate portfolio of 224,768 communications sites included 43,275 communications sites in the U.S. & Canada, 78,469 communications sites in Asia-Pacific, 23,755 communications sites in Africa, 30,721 communications sites in Europe and 48,548 communications sites in Latin America, as well as (i) urban telecommunications assets, including fiber, in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, India, Mexico, South Africa and Spain, (ii) other property interests in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United States and (iii) 28 data center facilities across ten United States markets. In December 2021, we completed the acquisition of CoreSite Realty Corporation (“CoreSite”), consisting of over 20 data center facilities and related assets in eight United States markets, for total consideration of $10.4 billion, including the assumption and repayment of CoreSite’s existing debt (the “CoreSite Acquisition”). In 2022, in connection with the funding of the CoreSite Acquisition, we entered into agreements with certain investment vehicles affiliated with Stonepeak Partners LP (such investment vehicles, collectively, “Stonepeak”) for Stonepeak to acquire a noncontrolling ownership interest in our U.S. data center business for total aggregate consideration of approximately $3.1 billion, through an investment in common equity and mandatorily convertible preferred equity (the “Stonepeak Transaction”). As of December 31, 2022, we hold a common equity interest of approximately 72% in our U.S. data center business, with Stonepeak holding approximately 28% of the outstanding common equity and 100% of the outstanding mandatorily convertible preferred equity. On a fully converted basis, which is expected to occur four years from the date of the initial closing in August 2022, and on the basis of the currently outstanding equity, we will hold a controlling ownership interest in our U.S. data center business of approximately 64%, with Stonepeak holding approximately 36%. We operate as a real estate investment trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes (“REIT”). Accordingly, we generally are not required to pay U.S. federal income taxes on income generated by our REIT operations, including the income derived from leasing space on our towers and in our data centers, as we receive a dividends paid deduction for distributions to stockholders that generally offsets our REIT income and gains. However, we remain obligated to pay U.S. federal income taxes on earnings from our domestic taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRSs”). In addition, our international assets and operations, regardless of their classification for U.S. tax purposes, continue to be subject to taxation in the jurisdictions where those assets are held or those operations are conducted. The use of TRSs enables us to continue to engage in certain businesses and jurisdictions while complying with REIT qualification requirements. We may, from time to time, change the election of previously designated TRSs to be included as part of the REIT. As of December 31, 2022, our REIT-qualified businesses included our U.S. tower leasing business, a majority of our U.S. indoor DAS networks business, our Services and Data Centers segments, as well as most of our operations in Canada, Costa Rica, France, Germany, Ghana, Kenya, Mexico, Nigeria, South Africa and Uganda. 1 Table of Contents We report our results in seven segments – U.S. & Canada property (which includes all assets in the United States and Canada, other than our data center facilities and related assets), Asia-Pacific property, Africa property, Europe property, Latin America property, Data Centers and Services. Products and Services Property Operations Our property operations accounted for 98%, 97% and 99% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our revenue is primarily generated from tenant leases. Within our tower leasing operations, our tenants lease space on our communications real estate, where they install and maintain their equipment. Rental payments vary considerably depending upon numerous factors, including, but not limited to, amount, type and position of tenant equipment on the tower, remaining tower capacity and tower location. Our costs typically include ground rent (which is primarily fixed under long-term lease agreements with annual cost escalations) and power and fuel costs, some or all of which may be passed through to our tenants, as well as property taxes and repair and maintenance expenses. Our property operations have generated consistent growth in revenue and typically have low cash flow volatility due to the following characteristics: • Long-term tenant leases with contractual rent escalations. In general, our tenant leases for our communications sites with wireless carriers have initial non-cancellable terms of five to ten years with multiple renewal terms, with provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease, typically annually, based on a fixed escalation percentage (averaging approximately 3% in the United States) or an inflationary index in most of our international markets, or a combination of both. Based upon foreign currency exchange rates and the tenant leases in place as of December 31, 2022, we expect to generate over $62 billion of non-cancellable tenant lease revenue over future periods, before the impact of straight-line lease accounting. • Consistent demand for our sites. As a result of rapidly growing usage of mobile data and other wireless services and the corresponding wireless industry capital spending trends in the markets we serve, we anticipate consistent demand for our communications sites. We believe that our global asset base positions us well to benefit from the increasing proliferation of advanced wireless devices and the increasing usage of high bandwidth applications on those devices. We have the ability to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our sites, which typically results in incremental revenue and modest incremental costs. Our site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with a solid platform for new business opportunities, which has historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth. • High lease renewal rates. Our tenants tend to renew leases because suitable alternative sites may not exist or be available and repositioning a site in their network may be expensive and may adversely affect network quality. We define churn as tenant billings lost when a tenant cancels or does not renew its lease or, in limited circumstances, when the lease rates on existing leases are reduced. We derive our churn rate for a given year by dividing our tenant billings lost on this basis by our prior-year tenant billings. Historically, churn has averaged approximately 1% to 2% of tenant billings per year. During the year ended December 31, 2022, churn was approximately 5% of our tenant billings, primarily driven by churn in our U.S. & Canada property segment. We expect that our churn rate in our U.S. & Canada property segment will continue to be elevated for a period of several years through 2025 due to contractual lease cancellations and non-renewals by T-Mobile US, Inc. (“T-Mobile”), including legacy Sprint Corporation leases, pursuant to the terms of our master lease agreement with T-Mobile (the “T-Mobile MLA”) entered into in September 2020. • High operating margins. Incremental operating costs associated with adding new tenants or equipment to an existing communications site are relatively minimal. Therefore, as tenants or equipment are added, the substantial majority of incremental revenue flows through to gross margin and operating profit. In addition, in many of our international markets, certain expenses, such as ground rent or power and fuel costs, are reimbursed or shared by our tenant base. • Low maintenance capital expenditures. On average, we require relatively low amounts of annual capital expenditures to maintain our communications sites. Our property business includes the operation of communications sites and managed networks, the leasing of property interests and, in select markets, the operation of fiber, the operation of data centers and the provision of backup power through shared generators. Our presence in a number of markets at different relative stages of wireless development provides us with significant diversification and long-term growth potential. Our property segments accounted for the following percentage of 2 Table of Contents consolidated total revenue for the years ended December 31,: 2022 2021 2020 U.S. & Canada 47 % 52 % 56 % Asia-Pacific 10 % 13 % 14 % Africa 11 % 11 % 11 % Europe 7 % 5 % 2 % Latin America 16 % 16 % 16 % Data Centers 7 % 0 % — % Communications Sites. Approximately 89%, 95% and 95% of revenue in our property segments was attributable to our communications sites, excluding DAS networks, for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We lease space on our communications sites to tenants providing a diverse range of communications services, including cellular voice and data, broadcasting, mobile video and a number of other applications. In addition, in many of our international markets, we receive pass-through revenue from our tenants to cover certain costs, including power and fuel costs and ground rent. Our top tenants by revenue for each property segment are as follows for the year ended December 31, 2022: • U.S. & Canada: AT&T Inc. (“AT&T”); T-Mobile; and Verizon Wireless accounted for an aggregate of 88% of U.S. & Canada property segment revenue. • Asia-Pacific: Bharti Airtel Limited (“Airtel”); Reliance Jio; and VIL accounted for an aggregate of 90% of Asia-Pacific property segment revenue. • Africa: Airtel; and MTN Group Limited (“MTN”) accounted for an aggregate of 78% of Africa property segment revenue. • Europe: Telefónica S.A. (“Telefónica”) accounted for an aggregate of 71% of Europe property segment revenue. • Latin America: América Móvil; AT&T; Telefónica; and TIM S.p.A. accounted for an aggregate of 74% of Latin America property segment revenue. Accordingly, we are subject to certain risks, as set forth in Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption “Risk Factors—A substantial portion of our current and projected revenue is derived from a small number of customers, and we are sensitive to adverse changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our customers.” As further discussed in Item 7 of this Annual Report under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Executive Overview” and “—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates,” in the third quarter of 2022, VIL communicated that it would make partial payments of its contractual amounts owed to us and indicated that it would continue to make partial payments for the remainder of 2022 (the “VIL Shortfall”). In late 2022, VIL had communicated its intent to resume payments in full under its contractual obligations owed to us beginning on January 1, 2023. However, in early 2023, VIL communicated that it would not be able to resume payments in full of its contractual obligations owed to us, and that it would instead continue to make partial payments. We considered these recent developments and the uncertainty with respect to amounts owed under our tenant leases when conducting our annual impairment assessments for long-lived assets and goodwill in India and, as a result, we determined that certain fixed and intangible assets had been impaired. As a result of the challenging business environment in India, we are exploring various strategic alternatives aimed at potentially reducing our exposure there, including the sale of an equity interest in our India operations to one or more private investors. Any such completed transaction could have a material impact on our financial statements and on our results of operations in the period in which any such transaction occurred. There can be no assurance that any such strategic alternative will be implemented and, if so implemented, as to the timing thereof, and any such proposed transaction would be subject to conditions, including regulatory approvals in India. In addition, we are subject to risks related to our international operations, as set forth under the caption “Risk Factors—Our foreign operations are subject to economic, political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position, including risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.” Managed Networks, Fiber and Related Assets, Data Centers and Related Assets, Property Interests and Shared Generators. In addition to our communications sites, we also own and operate several types of managed network solutions, provide communications site management services to third parties, manage and lease property interests under carrier or other third-party communications sites, provide the right to use fiber, operate data center facilities and provide back-up power sources to tenants at our sites. The balance of our property segment revenue not attributable to our communications sites was attributable to these items. 3 Table of Contents • Managed Networks. We own and operate DAS networks in the United States and certain international markets. We obtain rights from property owners to install and operate in-building DAS networks, and we grant rights to wireless service providers to attach their equipment to our installations. We also offer a small portfolio of outdoor DAS networks as a complementary shared infrastructure solution for our tenants in the United States and in certain international markets. Typically, we have designed, built and operated our outdoor DAS networks in areas in which zoning restrictions or other barriers may prevent or delay deployment of more traditional wireless communications sites, such as macro tower sites. We also hold lease rights and easement interests on rooftops capable of hosting communications equipment in locations where towers are generally not a viable solution based on area characteristics. In addition, we provide management services to property owners in the United States who elect to retain full rights to their property while simultaneously marketing the rooftop for wireless communications equipment installation. As the demand for advanced wireless services in urban markets evolves, we continue to evaluate a variety of infrastructure solutions, including small cells and other network architectures that may support our tenants’ networks in these areas. • Fiber and Related Assets. We own and operate fiber and related assets in certain international markets. We currently provide the right to use such fiber and related assets to communications and internet service providers and third-party operators to support their telecommunications infrastructure. We expect to continue to evaluate opportunities to invest selectively in and expand these and other similar assets in the future as part of advanced network deployments. • Data Centers and Related Assets. As a result of our recent data center acquisitions, we own and operate data center facilities and related assets in the United States, which consist of specialized and secure buildings that house networking, storage and communications technology infrastructure, including servers, storage devices, switches, routers and fiber optic transmission equipment. These buildings are designed to provide the power, cooling and network connectivity necessary to efficiently operate this equipment. Data centers located at points where many communications networks converge can also function as interconnection hubs where customers are able to connect to multiple networks, cloud companies and other service providers to exchange traffic and interoperate with each other. • Property Interests . We own portfolios of property interests in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United States, including land under carrier or other third-party communications sites, which provide recurring cash flow under complementary leasing arrangements. • Shared Generators . We have contracts with certain of our tenants in the United States pursuant to which we provide access to shared backup power generators. Services Operations We offer tower-related services in the United States, including site application, zoning and permitting, structural analysis and construction management services. Our services operations primarily support our site leasing business, including through the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites. This segment accounted for 2%, 3% and 1% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Site Application, Zoning and Permitting . We engage in site application services on our own behalf in connection with our tower development projects, as well as on behalf of our tenants. We typically work with our tenants’ engineers to determine the geographic areas where new communications sites will best address the tenants’ needs and meet their coverage objectives. Once a new site is identified, we acquire the rights to the land or structure on which the site will be constructed, and we manage the permitting process to ensure all necessary approvals are obtained to construct and operate the communications site. Structural Analysis. We offer structural analysis services to wireless carriers in connection with the installation of their communications equipment on our towers. Our team of engineers can evaluate whether a tower structure can support the additional burden of the new equipment or if an upgrade is needed, which enables our tenants to better assess potential sites before making an installation decision. Our structural analysis capabilities enable us to provide higher quality service to our existing tenants by, among other things, reducing the time required to achieve on-air readiness, while also providing opportunities to offer structural analysis services to third parties. Construction Management. We offer construction management services to wireless carriers in connection with the deployment of their networks on our tower sites. Our construction management team oversees construction activities such as contractor sourcing, contractor selection and management, materials management, on-site quality control and closeout documentation for new installations or modifications. Our construction management capabilities enable us to provide efficient deployment to the carriers while ensuring that the construction work meets our quality control standards. 4 Table of Contents Strategy Operational Strategy As wireless communications technologies advance and the use of wireless services on handsets, tablets and other advanced mobile devices grows, there is a corresponding increase in demand for the communications infrastructure required to facilitate ever growing network demand. To capture this demand, our primary operational focus is to (i) increase the occupancy of our existing communications real estate portfolio to support global connectivity, (ii) invest in, and selectively grow, our communications real estate portfolio and service offerings, including through platform expansion initiatives, (iii) further improve our operational performance and efficiency and (iv) maintain a strong balance sheet. We believe these efforts to meet our customers’ needs will support and enhance our ability to capitalize on the growth in demand for wireless infrastructure. In addition, we expect to explore new opportunities to enhance or extend our shared communications infrastructure businesses, including those that may make our assets incrementally more attractive to new customers, or to existing customers for new uses, and those that increase our operational efficiency. • Increase the occupancy of our existing communications real estate portfolio to support global connectivity. We believe that our highest incremental returns will be achieved by leasing additional space on our existing communications sites. Increasing demand for wireless services in our served markets has resulted in significant capital spending by major wireless carriers and other connectivity providers. As a result, we anticipate growing demand for our communications sites because they are attractively located and typically have capacity available for additional tenants and equipment. In the United States, incremental carrier network activity is being driven by ongoing network densification initiatives as well as the early stages of multiple concurrent 5G network deployments. In our international markets, carriers are increasingly deploying more advanced network technologies such as 4G and, in the case of our international markets with more mature network technology, 5G, while continuing to selectively augment legacy networks. We believe that the majority of our towers have capacity for additional tenants and that substantially all of our towers that are currently at or near full structural capacity can be upgraded or augmented to meet future tenant demand with relatively modest capital investment. Therefore, we will continue to target our sales and marketing activities to increase the utilization and return on investment of our existing communications sites. • Invest in and selectively grow our communications real estate portfolio to meet our customers’ needs. We seek opportunities to invest in and grow our operations through our capital expenditure program, acquisitions and platform expansion initiatives. A significant portion of our inorganic growth has been focused on properties with lower initial tenancy because we believe that over time we can significantly increase tenancy levels, and therefore, drive strong returns on those assets. More recently, we have invested in strategic data center assets, including through the CoreSite Acquisition, which we believe can drive strong, recurring growth and also meaningfully enhance the value of our existing communications tower real estate through emerging edge compute opportunities in the future. We also expect to explore additional ways to use our platform expansion initiatives to enhance the efficiency of our operations over time. • Further improve our operational performance and efficiency. We continue to seek opportunities to improve our operational performance throughout the organization. This includes investing in our systems and people as we strive to improve efficiency and provide superior service to our customers. To achieve this, we intend to continue to focus on customer service initiatives, such as reducing cycle times for key functions, including lease processing and tower structural analysis. We are also focused on developing and implementing renewable power solutions across our footprint to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and help improve the overall efficiency of the communications infrastructure and wireless industries through our sustainability and power as a service (PaaS) initiatives. • Maintain a strong balance sheet. We remain committed to disciplined financial policies, which we believe result in our ability to maintain a strong balance sheet and will support our overall strategy and focus on asset growth and operational excellence. As a result of these policies, we currently have investment grade credit ratings. We continue to focus on maintaining a robust liquidity position and, as of December 31, 2022, had $7.1 billion of available liquidity. We believe that our investment grade credit ratings provide us consistent access to the capital markets and our liquidity provides us the ability to continue to invest in growing and augmenting our business. Capital Allocation Strategy The objective of our capital allocation strategy is to simultaneously increase adjusted funds from operations per share and our return on invested capital over the long term. To maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT, we are required annually to distribute an amount equal to at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain) to our stockholders. After complying with our REIT distribution requirements, we plan to continue to allocate our available capital among investment alternatives that meet or exceed our return on investment criteria, while taking into account the repayment of debt consistent with our financial policies. 5 Table of Contents • Capital expenditure program. We expect to continue to invest in and expand our existing communications real estate portfolio through our capital expenditure program. This includes capital expenditures associated with site maintenance, increasing the capacity of our existing sites and projects such as new site and data center facility construction, land interest acquisitions and power solutions. • Acquisitions. We intend to continue to pursue acquisitions of communications sites and other telecommunications infrastructure in our existing or new markets where we can meet or exceed our risk-adjusted return on investment criteria. The risk-adjusted hurdle rates used to evaluate acquisition opportunities consider additional factors such as the country and counterparties involved, investment and economic climate, legal and regulatory conditions and industry risk, among others. • Return excess capital to stockholders . If we have excess capital available after funding (i) our required distributions, (ii) capital expenditures, (iii) the repayment of debt consistent with our financial policies and (iv) anticipated future investments, including acquisition and select platform expansion opportunities, we will seek to return such excess capital to stockholders, including through our stock repurchase programs. International Growth Strategy We believe that, in certain international markets, we can create substantial value by either establishing a new, or expanding our existing, communications real estate leasing business. Therefore, we expect we will continue to seek international growth opportunities where we believe our risk-adjusted return objectives can be achieved. We strive to maintain a diversified approach to our international growth strategy by operating in a geographically diverse array of markets in a variety of stages of wireless network development. Our international growth strategy includes a disciplined, individualized market evaluation, in which we conduct the following analyses, among others: • Country analysis. Prior to entering a new market, we conduct an extensive review of the country’s historical and projected macroeconomic fundamentals, including inflation and foreign currency exchange rate trends, demographics, capital markets, tax regime and investment alternatives, and the general business, political and legal environments, including property rights and regulatory regime. • Wireless industry analysis. To confirm the presence of sufficient demand to support an independent tower leasing model, we analyze the competitiveness of the country’s wireless market. This includes an evaluation of the industry’s pricing environment, past and potential consolidation and the stage of its wireless network development. Characteristics that result in an attractive investment opportunity include (i) multiple competitive wireless service providers who are actively seeking to invest in deploying voice and data networks and (ii) ongoing or expected deployment of incremental spectrum from recent or anticipated auctions. • Opportunity and counterparty analysis. Once an investment opportunity is identified within a geographic area with an attractive wireless industry, we conduct a multifaceted opportunity and counterparty analysis. This includes evaluating (i) the type of transaction, (ii) its ability to meet our risk-adjusted return criteria given the country and the counterparties involved, including the anticipated anchor tenant and (iii) how the transaction fits within our long-term strategic objectives, including future potential investment and expansion within the region. Regulatory Matters Towers, Antennas and Fiber. Our U.S. and international tower leasing businesses are subject to national, state and local regulatory requirements with respect to the registration, siting, construction, lighting, marking and maintenance of our towers. In the United States, the construction of new towers or modifications to existing towers may require pre-approval by the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) and the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”), depending on factors such as tower height and proximity to public airfields. Towers requiring pre-approval must be registered with the FCC and maintained in accordance with FAA standards. Similar requirements regarding pre-approval of the construction and modification of towers are imposed by regulators in other countries. Non-compliance with applicable tower-related requirements may lead to monetary penalties or site deconstruction orders. Certain of our international operations are subject to regulatory requirements with respect to licensing, registration, permitting and public listings. In India, our subsidiary, ATC Telecom Infrastructure Private Limited (“ATC TIPL”), holds an Infrastructure Provider Category-I (“IP-I”) Registration Certificate issued by the Indian Ministry of Communications and Information Technology, which permits us to provide tower space to companies licensed as telecommunications service providers under the Indian Telegraph Act of 1885. As a condition to the IP-I, the Indian government has the right to take over telecommunications infrastructure in the case of emergency or war. Additionally, in 2018, ATC TIPL issued non-convertible debentures, which are listed on the National Stock Exchange of India. Although the debt is held by another subsidiary of ours and is eliminated in consolidation, ATC TIPL is still subject to the listing requirements of such exchange. In Asia-Pacific, our subsidiaries in the Philippines and Bangladesh are required to hold a registration or license in order to establish, manage and operate passive telecommunications infrastructure services. 6 Table of Contents Our subsidiaries in New Zealand are required to satisfy certain investment and reporting requirements. Specifically, our subsidiaries are required to invest $10 million in the aggregate in additional land interests under telecommunications assets in New Zealand by September 30, 2027, of which $5 million must be invested by September 30, 2025. Quarterly reporting for all acquisitions and dispositions is required to be provided to the Overseas Investment Office. In Africa, our subsidiaries in Burkina Faso, Ghana, Kenya, Niger, Nigeria and Uganda are required to hold a license in order to establish and maintain passive telecommunications infrastructure services and DAS networks for communications service providers. Additionally, in Uganda, our subsidiary is subject to review for three years commencing in 2020 by a monitoring trustee regarding compliance with certain conditions of approval of our acquisition in 2019 of Eaton Towers Holdings Limited. In Latin America, our subsidiary in Chile holds a concession of intermediate telecommunications services and our subsidiary in Argentina holds an information and communications technology service license. In Peru, our subsidiaries are registered as infrastructure providers at the Ministry of Transport and Communications and in Colombia, our subsidiaries have a general authorization certificate for the provision of telecommunications networks and/or services. The subsidiaries that hold our fiber business in Mexico and Brazil are also licensed and regulated as concession holders and permit holders authorized to provide telecommunications services. In many of the markets in which we operate, we are required to provide tower space to service providers on a non-discriminatory basis, subject to the negotiation of mutually agreeable terms. Additionally, in 2023, one of our Brazilian subsidiaries, American Tower do Brasil – Cessao de Infraestruturas S.A. (“ATC Brazil”) issued non-convertible debentures, which are listed on the Brazilian stock exchange. Although the non-convertible debentures are held by another subsidiary of ours and are eliminated in consolidation, ATC Brazil is still subject to the listing requirements of such exchange. Our international business operations may be subject to increased licensing fees or ownership restrictions. For example, in South Africa, the Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment Act, 2003 (the “BBBEE Act”) has established a legislative framework for the promotion of economic empowerment of South African citizens disadvantaged by Apartheid. Accordingly, the BBBEE Act and related codes measure BBBEE Act compliance and good corporate practice by the inclusion of certain ownership, management control, employment equity and other metrics for companies that do business there. In Kenya, our regulator requires all holders of a commercial license to issue at least 30% of their shares to Kenyans within three years of receiving the license unless a waiver is obtained to extend such period of compliance by a year. In addition, certain municipalities have sought to impose permit fees based upon structural or operational requirements of towers and certain regional and other governmental bodies have sought to impose levies or other forms of fees. Our foreign operations may be affected if a country’s regulatory authority restricts, revokes or modifies spectrum licenses of certain wireless service providers or implements limitations on foreign ownership. In all countries where we operate, we are subject to zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by local authorities or community organizations. While these regulations vary, they typically require tower owners or tenants to obtain approval from local authorities or community standards organizations prior to tower construction or the addition of a new antenna to an existing tower. Local zoning authorities and community residents often oppose construction in their communities, which can delay or prevent new tower construction, new antenna installation or site upgrade projects, thereby limiting our ability to respond to tenant demand. This opposition and existing or new zoning regulations can increase costs associated with new tower construction, tower modifications or additions of new antennas to a site or site upgrades, as well as adversely affect the associated timing or cost of such projects. Further, additional regulations may be adopted that cause delays or result in additional costs to us or changes in the competitive landscape that may negatively affect our business. These factors could materially and adversely affect our operations. In the United States, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 prohibits any action by state and local authorities that would discriminate between different providers of wireless services or ban altogether the construction, modification or placement of communications sites. It also prohibits state or local restrictions based on the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent the facilities comply with FCC regulations. Further, in February 2012, the United States government adopted regulations requiring that local and state governments approve modifications or colocations that qualify as eligible facilities under the regulations. Portions of our business are subject to additional regulations, for example, in a number of states throughout the United States, certain of our subsidiaries hold Competitive Local Exchange Carrier (CLEC) or other status, in connection with the operation of our outdoor DAS networks business. In addition, we, or our customers, may be subject to new regulatory policies in certain jurisdictions from time to time that may materially and adversely affect our business or the demand for our communications sites. Data Centers . Our U.S. data center facilities and related assets are subject to various federal, state and local regulations, such as state and local fire and life safety regulations and Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) federal requirements. If one of our properties is not in compliance with these regulations, we may be required to make significant unanticipated expenditures in order to comply with such regulations and/or pay fines or civil damage awards. Existing regulations may subsequently change 7 Table of Contents or future regulations may be enacted, either of which could have a similar impact as described above, and could materially and adversely affect our operations. Environmental Matters. Our U.S. and international operations are subject to various national, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the management, use, storage, disposal, emission and remediation of, and exposure to, hazardous and non-hazardous substances, materials and wastes, the siting of our towers and the maintenance of our data center facilities. We may be required to obtain permits, pay additional property taxes, comply with regulatory requirements and make certain informational filings related to hazardous substances or devices used to provide power such as batteries, generators and fuel at our tower sites and/or data center facilities. When a site is decommissioned, we are required to follow applicable regulatory requirements, including by following decommissioning procedures and environmental management plans. With respect to our data center facilities, the presence of contamination, asbestos, mold or other air quality issues or the failure to remediate contamination, asbestos, mold or other air quality issues at our facilities may expose us to third-party liability or materially adversely affect our ability to sell, lease or develop the real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral. Violations of these types of regulations could subject us to fines or criminal sanctions. Additionally, in the United States and in other countries where we operate, before constructing a new tower or adding an antenna to an existing site, we must review and evaluate the impact of the action to determine whether it may significantly affect the environment and whether we must disclose any significant impacts in an environmental assessment. If a tower or new antenna might have a material adverse impact on the environment, FCC or other governmental approval of the tower or antenna could be significantly delayed or modifications to the site construction plans may be necessary. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, some of the states and localities in which we operate and the governments of other countries in which we operate have also enacted certain climate change laws and regulations and/or have begun regulating carbon footprints and greenhouse gas emissions and may adopt new regulations related to the use of fossil fuels or requiring the use of alternative fuel or renewable energy sources to power energy resources that serve our data centers. Efforts to support and enhance renewable electricity generation may increase our costs of electricity above those that would be incurred through procurement of conventional electricity. Our data centers require and consume significant amounts of power, including electricity generated by the burning of fossil fuels. These laws, regulations and stakeholder requests could limit our ability to develop new facilities or result in substantial compliance, maintenance, repair, retrofit and construction costs, including capital expenditures for environmental control facilities and other new equipment. Changes in regulations that affect electric power providers, such as regulations related to the control of greenhouse gas emissions or other climate change-related matters, could adversely affect the costs of electric power and increase our operating costs, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations or those of our customers. Health and Safety. In the United States and in other countries where we operate, we are subject to various national, state and local laws regarding employee health and safety, including protection from radio frequency exposure and air quality issues. Additionally, and in response to various national, state and local laws and guidance enacted in response to the ongoing coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic, we implemented work-from-home arrangements and travel restrictions for our employees where practicable, as well as and other modifications to our business practices. Competition Our industry is highly competitive. We compete, both for new business and for the acquisition of assets, with other public tower companies, such as Crown Castle International Corp., SBA Communications Corporation, Telesites S.A.B. de C.V. and Cellnex Telecom, S.A., wireless carrier tower consortia such as Indus Towers Limited and private tower companies, private equity sponsored firms, carrier-affiliated tower companies, independent wireless carriers, tower owners, broadcasters and owners of non-communications sites, including rooftops, utility towers, water towers and other alternative structures. Our data center business also competes with a variety of companies offering similar data center solutions and services, including space, power, interconnection and development services. We believe that location and capacity, network and/or interconnection density, price, quality and speed of service have been, and will continue to be, significant competitive factors affecting owners, operators and managers of communications sites and data center facilities. Our services business competes with a variety of companies offering individual, or combinations of, competing services. The field of competitors includes site application consultants, zoning consultants, real estate firms, right-of-way consultants, structural engineering firms, construction management firms, tower owners/managers, telecommunications equipment vendors who can provide turnkey site development services through multiple subcontractors and our tenants’ personnel. We believe that our tenants base their decisions for services on various criteria, including a company’s experience, local reputation, price and time for completion of a project. 8 Table of Contents For more information on demand trends in our industry, see Item 7 of this Annual Report under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Executive Overview.” Human Capital Resources As of December 31, 2022, we employed 6,391 full-time individuals, including 2,375 employees based in the United States and 4,016 employees based internationally. Our teams in our nearly 30 countries around the world are our most important assets and fundamental to our success. Aligned with our business strategy, our human capital management strategy focuses on developing and delivering solutions to attract, develop, engage and retain top diverse talent in each of the countries where we operate. We consider our employee relations to be good. Our Chief Sustainability Officer and Chief Human Resources Officer regularly report to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors, respectively, on our initiatives related to human capital management. Employee Engagement . In 2022, our employees participated in several surveys related to our company-wide sustainability efforts, our internal communications and how we measure up against our targeted values. We also solicited, and responded to, feedback from our employees regarding our return-to-office policies. Across the globe, most of our employees now work on a hybrid schedule. Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. Diversity, equity and inclusion are fundamental considerations and values for us in conducting business. A critical factor in our success is ensuring that each of these remains at the core of our business culture, infusing fresh ideas, helping us remain connected to our customers in a dynamic global market and ensuring mutual respect guides us in our interactions both internally and externally. We have adopted a Global Human Rights Statement, which can be found on our website. Our Board of Directors is a diverse group with respect to traditional diversity metrics such as gender, race and national origin, as well as professional background and skills, with five members of our board identifying as female and four identifying as part of a minority group. We are also committed to ensuring diverse representation among our employees. In 2022, 35% of all employees promoted globally were female, which is greater than the female representation in our workforce of 29%. And as of December 31, 2022, nearly 35% of management-level positions in the United States were also held by women. The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (the “EEOC”) requires employers to submit an EEO-1 report on an annual basis. The report breaks down an employer’s workforce by race, ethnicity and gender across job categories established by the EEOC. We publish the EEO-1 reports on our website, which provides transparency for our stakeholders to better understand our diversity and workforce practices, and helps us identify areas for growth as we continue strengthening our diversity efforts and initiatives. Additionally, we have implemented several initiatives designed to help address social injustice and enhance our diversity. These include pledges from the American Tower Foundation of (i) $1.0 million for grants to organizations around the globe, recommended by our Social Justice Committee, supporting charitable organizations that are promoting racial equity and enhancing the American Tower Foundation’s work on social justice and (ii) a total of $1.0 million for scholarship funds at two Historically Black Colleges and Universities. In 2022, our Chief Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Officer continued to lead our diversity, equity and inclusion strategy by introducing new initiatives and best practices, including working with each region to develop relevant representation, development and recruitment goals and updating employees on a company-wide resource center. With the oversight of our Chief Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Officer, we developed our first employee resource group, Women and Allies of American Tower Climb Higher (“WAATCH”), in our U.S. and Latin America offices, to promote better employee connection and collaboration. WAATCH focuses on mentorship, networking and working with the local communities on charitable initiatives. Talent Development and Recruitment. As a critical investment in our capacity to provide our customers with outstanding support and customer service, we offer a variety of development opportunities unique to each market to cultivate our talent throughout our global organization. For individual contributors, we have 9,600 resources in up to five languages that focus on job-specific training and general topics, such as productivity, collaboration and project management. We create and customize courses to meet regional needs and update these courses regularly to address changing marketplace dynamics and employee interests. Developing our managers is critical to our success, and over 39,000 resources and tools are provided to all levels of management. For example, our management development programs provide continuous learning opportunities through training led by American Tower leaders. Managers learn tools and best practices that enable both management and team success, and that build and strengthen competencies to better respond to the needs of a growing and increasingly complex organization. Our annual Advanced Leadership Development program, in collaboration with the INSEAD executive education program, provides 9 Table of Contents our next generation leaders in Latin America, Europe, the U.S. and Africa with a twelve-week intensive workshop to enhance management and leadership skills. The Leadership Excellence at American Tower program supports global senior leaders’ development through its partnership with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Participants learn from leading experts on topics like global strategy and leading in uncertain times. For our U.S. employees in underrepresented groups who are considered emerging leaders, we offer The Power of Choice program. This development opportunity, which is a blend of in-person and virtual sessions, is designed to support these employees through a career path journey. We also have a comprehensive talent-management review process to develop future leaders and ensure effective succession planning. Our recruiting efforts consistently include strategies to build diverse candidate pipelines and promote a culture that supports a diverse team of global employees. We are proud of our Leadership Development Program, which provides a recruitment opportunity for business school students, who are able to learn about different aspects of our business through regular rotational assignments. Further, with respect to our Leadership Development Program, as of December 31, 2022, 56% of our hires identified as part of a minority group and 44% identified as female. We have also continued our recruiting efforts with Historically Black Colleges and Universities as well as other recruiting efforts to build a diverse talent pipeline. Our Compensation Committee also approved a shared human capital management goal for the entire executive team for 2022, which focuses on developing talent, with a particular focus on underrepresented groups. Workplace Safety. We are committed to the safety of our employees and surrounding communities. Depending on the role, team members are required to pass and complete regular safety training courses and follow specific tower and site safety protocols with the support of operational manuals. A key component of our culture is a strong commitment to incident reporting and corrective actions, as well as a comprehensive program for ensuring vendor compliance with safety standards and certifications. Our strict adherence to the rigorous standards set forth by the relevant government agencies and other authorities, such as the Telecommunications Infrastructure Registered Apprenticeship Program and Telecommunications Industry Association, is critical to ensuring our towers are structurally safe for field personnel, vendors, customers and communities. In 2022, our Chief Security Officer implemented several employee safety and security protocols. In 2022, our Chief Security Officer led the production of enhanced security standards to better protect our people and assets worldwide. These include global standards for the security of international travelers and personnel ground movements. We also implemented a traveler assistance program that allows us to better monitor international travel and provide employees with relevant trip advice and 24/7 assistance services. Health and Wellness. We offer medical and parental leave benefits to full-time employees across all markets, with some local variation. As a result of the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we conduct wellness check-ins and offer resources to support our employees’ mental health and well-being, including access to a free Employee Assistance Program, which offers confidential assistance on a wide range of issues. We also offer market competitive benefits in all locations and, in 2022, continued our behavioral health benefit in the United States to support employees’ mental well-being.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Risks Related to Our Business Strategy A significant decrease in leasing demand for our communications infrastructure would materially and adversely affect our business and operating results, and we cannot control that demand. A significant reduction in leasing demand for our communications infrastructure would materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. Factors that may affect such demand include: • increased mergers, consolidations or exits that reduce the number of communications service providers or increased use of network sharing among governments or communications service providers; • the financial condition of communications service providers; • zoning, environmental, health, tax or other government regulations or changes in the application and enforcement thereof; • governmental licensing of spectrum or restriction or revocation of our customers’ spectrum licenses; • a decrease in demand for wireless or colocation services, including due to general economic conditions, disruption in the financial and credit markets or global social, political or health crises, such as the material adverse effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and markets, inflation, slowing growth, rising interest rates or recession; • the ability and willingness of wireless and cloud service providers to maintain or increase capital expenditures on network infrastructure; • delays or changes in the deployment of next generation wireless technologies; and • technological changes. A substantial portion of our current and projected future revenue is derived from a small number of customers, and we are sensitive to adverse changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our customers. A substantial portion of our total operating revenues is derived from a small number of customers. If any of these customers are unwilling or unable to perform their obligations under their agreements with us, our revenues, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, our growth projections are based on future revenue from a small number of customers, and such projections could be adversely impacted by adverse changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our customers. One or more of our customers, or their parent companies, may experience financial difficulties, file for bankruptcy or reduce or terminate operations as a result of a prolonged economic downturn, economic difficulties (including those from the imposition of taxes, fees, regulations or judicial interpretations of regulations, and any associated penalties or interest, which may be substantial) or otherwise. The current inflationary and high interest rate environment could materially and adversely affect our customers through disruptions of, among other things, their ability to procure their equipment through their supply chains, their ability to procure power and fuel and their ability to maintain liquidity and deploy network capital, with potential decreases in consumer spending contributing to liquidity risks. Such financial difficulties could result in uncollectible accounts receivable and an impairment of our deferred rent asset, tower asset, network location intangible asset, tenant-related intangible asset or goodwill. The loss of significant customers, or the loss of all or a portion of our anticipated lease revenues from certain customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Our largest customer in India is VIL, which represented approximately 3.2% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022. In the third quarter of 2022, VIL communicated that it would make partial payments of its contractual amounts owed to us and indicated that it would continue to make partial payments for the remainder of 2022. In late 2022, VIL had communicated its intent to resume payments in full under its contractual obligations owed to us beginning on January 1, 2023. However, in early 2023, VIL communicated that it would not be able to resume payments in full of its contractual obligations owed to us, and that it would instead continue to make partial payments. We considered these recent developments and the uncertainty with respect to amounts owed under our tenant leases when conducting our annual impairment assessments for long-lived assets and goodwill in India. As a result, we determined that certain fixed and intangible assets had been impaired during the year ended December 31, 2022. An impairment of $97.0 million was taken on tower and network location intangible assets in India. We also impaired the tenant-related intangible assets for VIL, which resulted in an impairment of $411.6 million. For more information on impairments in India, please see the information under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” 11 Table of Contents included in this Annual Report. For more information on revenue reserves related to the VIL Shortfall, please see the information under the caption ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation—Results of Operation"" included in this Annual Report. Continued partial payments from VIL could have further negative effects on our fixed assets, intangible assets or goodwill, could result in additional impairments and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. In October 2022, and as subsequently amended in February 2023, ATC TIPL and VIL notified the stock exchange of India that both parties have board approvals in relation to an issuance of convertible debentures pursuant to which, in exchange for VIL’s payment of certain amounts towards accounts receivables, ATC TIPL shall pay equivalent amounts towards subscription to convertible debentures issued by VIL. The convertible debentures are to be repaid by VIL with interest and ATC TIPL has the option to convert the debentures into equity of VIL. The issuance of the debentures is subject to certain conditions precedent, which may not be met. VIL may not be able to meet its operating obligations, including making payments to us in the future, which may result in us incurring additional impairment expenses or other similar charges, and which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Due to the long-term nature of our customer leases, we depend on the continued financial strength of our customers. Many communications service providers operate with substantial levels of debt. In our international operations, many of our customers are subsidiaries of global telecommunications companies. These subsidiaries may not have the explicit or implied financial support of their parent entities. In addition, many of our customers and potential customers rely on capital raising activities to fund their operations and capital expenditures, which may be more difficult or expensive in the event of downturns in the economy or disruptions in the financial and credit markets, such as the current environment driven by the significant disruptions caused by factors such as inflation, rising interest rates and supply chain disruptions. If our customers or potential customers are unable to raise adequate capital to fund their business plans or face capital constraints, they may reduce their spending, file for bankruptcy or reduce or terminate operations, which could materially and adversely affect demand for our communications infrastructure and our services business. In the ordinary course of our business, we do occasionally experience disputes with our customers, generally regarding the interpretation of terms in our leases. Historically, we have resolved these disputes in a manner that did not have a material adverse effect on us or our relationships with our customers. However, it is possible that such disputes could lead to a termination of our leases with those customers, a material adverse modification of the terms of those leases or a deterioration in our relationships with those customers that leads to a failure to obtain new business from them, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. If we are forced to resolve any of these disputes through litigation, our relationship with the applicable customer could be terminated or damaged, which could lead to decreased revenue or increased costs, resulting in a corresponding adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. If our customers consolidate their operations, exit their businesses or share site infrastructure to a significant degree, our growth, revenue and ability to generate positive cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Significant consolidation among our customers could reduce demand for our communications infrastructure and may materially and adversely affect our growth and revenues. Certain combined companies have rationalized duplicative parts of their networks or modernized their networks, and these and other customers could determine not to renew, or attempt to cancel, avoid or limit leases or related payments with us. In the event a customer terminates its business or separately sells its spectrum, we may experience increased churn as a result. Our ongoing contractual revenues and our future results may be negatively impacted if a significant number of these leases are terminated or not renewed. For example, see our discussion of churn as a result of the T-Mobile MLA in our U.S. & Canada property segment in Item 7 of this Annual Report, under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Executive Overview.” In addition, extensive sharing of site infrastructure, roaming or resale arrangements among wireless service providers, including due to increases in advanced network technology such as 5G, as an alternative to leasing our communications sites, without compensation to us, may cause new lease activity to slow if carriers utilize shared equipment rather than deploy new equipment, or may result in the decommissioning of equipment on certain existing sites because portions of the customers’ networks may become redundant. Increasing competition within our industry may materially and adversely affect our revenue. Our industry is highly competitive and our customers have numerous alternatives in leasing communications infrastructure assets. Competition due to pricing or alternative contractual arrangements from peers could materially and adversely affect our lease rates. We may not be able to renew existing customer leases or enter into new customer leases, or if we are able to renew 12 Table of Contents or enter into new leases, they may be at rates lower than our current rates or on less favorable terms than our current terms, resulting in an adverse impact on our results of operations and growth rate. Our expansion initiatives involve a number of risks and uncertainties, including those related to integrating acquired or leased assets, that could adversely affect our operating results, disrupt our operations or expose us to additional risk. As we continue to acquire and build communications sites and other communications infrastructure assets, including data center facilities and related assets, in our existing markets and expand into new markets, we are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including not meeting our return on investment criteria and financial objectives, increased costs, assumed liabilities and the diversion of managerial attention. Achieving the benefits of acquisition and platform expansion initiatives depends in part on timely and efficient integration of operations, telecommunications infrastructure assets and personnel. Integration may be difficult and unpredictable for many reasons, including, among other things, portfolios without requisite permits, differing systems, cultural differences, conflicting policies, procedures and operations. Significant acquisition-related integration costs, including certain nonrecurring charges such as costs associated with onboarding employees, integrating information technology systems, acquiring permits and visiting, inspecting, engineering and upgrading tower sites or other communications infrastructure assets, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in the period in which such charges are recorded or our cash flow in the period in which any related costs are actually paid. Some of our acquired portfolios have included sites that do not meet our structural specifications, including sites that may be overburdened. In these cases, beyond additional capital expenditures, general liability risks associated with such portfolios will exist until such time as those portfolios are upgraded or otherwise remedied. In addition, integration may significantly burden management and internal resources, including through the potential loss or unavailability of key personnel. Our international expansion initiatives are subject to additional risks, such as those described above, as well as our ability to comply with bribery and anti-corruption laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) and similar local laws. Moreover, we may fail to successfully integrate the assets we acquire or fail to utilize such assets to their full capacity. If we are not able to meet these integration challenges, we may not realize the benefits we expect from our acquired portfolios and businesses, and our business, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected. For example, failure to successfully and efficiently operate and expand acquired assets from the CoreSite Acquisition may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We must safeguard our customers’ infrastructure and equipment located in our data centers and ensure our data centers remain operational at all times. Problems at one or more of our data centers, whether or not within our control, could result in service interruptions or significant infrastructure or equipment damage. These could result from numerous factors, including energy cost and availability, human error, equipment failure, physical, electronic and cyber security breaches, fire, earthquake, hurricane, flood, tornado and other natural disasters, extreme temperatures, water damage, fiber cuts, power loss, terrorist acts, sabotage and vandalism, global pandemics or health emergencies and failure of business partners. We have service level commitment obligations to substantially all of our data center customers. As a result, service interruptions or significant equipment damage in our data centers could result in difficulty maintaining service level commitments to these customers and potential claims related to such failures. Because our data centers are critical to many of our customers’ businesses, service interruptions or significant equipment damage in our data centers could also result in lost profits or other indirect or consequential damages to our customers. In addition, any loss of service, equipment damage or inability to meet our service level commitment obligations could reduce the confidence of our customers and could consequently impair our ability to obtain and retain customers, which would adversely affect both our ability to generate revenues and our operating results. Furthermore, we are dependent upon internet service providers, telecommunications carriers and utility providers, some of which have experienced significant system failures and outages in the past. Our customers may in the future experience difficulties due to system failures unrelated to our systems and offerings. If, for any reason, these providers fail to provide the required services, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted. As a result of our acquisitions, we have a substantial amount of intangible assets and goodwill. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”), we are required to assess our goodwill and other intangible assets annually or more frequently in the event of circumstances indicating potential impairment to determine if they are impaired. If, as a result of the factors noted above, the testing performed indicates that an asset may not be recoverable or the carrying value exceeds the fair value, we would be required to record a non-cash impairment charge in the period the determination is made. Our platform expansion initiatives may not be successful, or we may be required to record impairment charges for our goodwill or for other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition, and could limit our continued investments in such platform expansion initiatives. 13 Table of Contents In addition, as we continue to invest in partnership opportunities to support our expansion initiatives, our partners may have business or economic goals that are inconsistent or conflict with ours, be in positions to take action contrary to our interests, policies or objectives, have competing interests in our, or other, markets that could create conflict of interest issues, withhold consents contrary to our requests or become unable or unwilling to fulfill their commitments, any of which could present governance challenges with multiple partners or expose us to additional liabilities or costs, including requiring us to assume and fulfill the obligations of that partnership or to execute buyouts of their interests. New technologies or changes, or lack thereof, in our or a customer’s business model could make our communications infrastructure leasing business less desirable and result in decreasing revenues and operating results. The development and implementation of new technologies designed to enhance the efficiency of wireless networks or changes in a customer’s business model could reduce the need for tower-based wireless services, decrease demand for tower space or reduce previously obtainable lease rates. In addition, if the industry trends toward deploying increased capital to the development and implementation of new technologies, then customers may allocate less of their budgets to leasing space on our towers. Examples of these technologies include more spectrally efficient technologies, which could relieve a portion of our customers’ network capacity needs and, as a result, could reduce the demand for tower-based antenna space. Additionally, certain small cell complementary network technologies or satellite services could shift a portion of our customers’ network investments away from traditional tower-based networks, which may reduce the need for carriers to add more equipment at certain communications sites. Moreover, the emergence of alternative technologies could reduce the need for tower-based broadcast services transmission and reception. Further, a customer may decide to cease outsourcing tower infrastructure or otherwise change its business model, which would result in a decrease in our revenue and operating results. Similarly, our data center site infrastructure may become antiquated due to the development of new systems that deliver power to, or eliminate heat from, the servers and other customer equipment that we house or the development of new technology that requires levels of power and cooling density that our facilities are not designed to provide. Our failure to innovate in response to the development and implementation of these or other new technologies or changes in a customer’s business model could have a material adverse effect on the growth of our business, results of operations or financial condition. Conversely, we may invest significant capital in technologies, platform expansion initiatives or new additions to our core business that may not provide expected returns or profitability, which could divert management attention and have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Additionally, our customers may overestimate or overvalue the benefits and use of 5G networks and other new technology that are deployed onto our communications sites that, in turn, could adversely affect our customers' growth, thereby adversely affecting our growth. Competition for assets could adversely affect our ability to achieve our return on investment criteria. We may experience increased competition for the acquisition of communications infrastructure assets or contracts to build new communications infrastructure assets for customers, which could make the acquisition of high-quality assets significantly more costly or prohibitive or cause us to lose contracts to build new sites. Some of our competitors are larger and may have greater financial resources than we do, while other competitors may apply less stringent investment criteria or less stringent contractual terms than we do. In addition, we may not anticipate increased competition entering a particular market or competing for the same assets. Higher prices for assets or the failure to add new assets to our portfolio could make it more difficult to achieve our anticipated returns on investment or future growth, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, some of our data center competitors have significant advantages over us, including greater name recognition, longer operating histories, lower operating costs, lower levels of leverage, pre-existing relationships with current or potential customers, greater financial, marketing and other resources, access to better networks and access to less expensive power. These advantages could allow our data center competitors to respond more quickly or effectively to strategic opportunities and as a result, we may lose existing or potential data center customers, incur costs to improve our properties or be forced to reduce our rental rates. These risks are compounded by the fact that a significant percentage of our data center customer leases expire every year. Risks Related to Our Financial Performance or General Economic Conditions Our leverage and debt service obligations, including during a rising interest rates environment, may materially and adversely affect our ability to raise additional financing to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives and to satisfy our distribution requirements. Our leverage and debt service obligations, including as a result of our recent CoreSite Acquisition, could have significant negative consequences to our business, results of operations or financial condition, including: 14 Table of Contents • requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our debt, thereby reducing the amount of our cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures and REIT distributions; • impairing our ability to meet one or more of the financial ratio covenants contained in our debt agreements or to generate cash sufficient to pay interest or principal due under those agreements, which could result in an acceleration of some or all of our outstanding debt and the loss of the towers securing such debt if a default remains uncured; • limiting our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing, thereby placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitors and competitors that may have better access to capital resources, including with respect to acquiring assets; and • limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the markets in which we compete. We may need to raise additional capital through debt financing activities, asset sales or equity issuances, even if the then-prevailing market conditions are not favorable, to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, required purchases of our partners’ interests and to satisfy our distribution requirements and debt service obligations and leverage requirements, including financial ratio covenants. An increase in our total leverage could lead to a downgrade of our credit rating below investment grade, which could negatively impact our ability to access credit markets or preclude us from obtaining funds on investment grade terms, rates and conditions or subject us to additional loan covenants, which could accelerate our debt repayment obligations. Further, certain of our current debt instruments limit the amount of indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may incur. Additional financing, therefore, may be unavailable, more expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness. Further, market volatility and disruption caused by factors such as inflation, rising interest rates and supply chain disruptions may impact our ability to raise additional capital through debt and equity financing activities or our ability to repay or refinance maturing liabilities, or impact the terms of any new obligations, which in turn may have an adverse impact on our credit ratings. The Federal Reserve Board began to raise interest rates in March 2022 for the first time in over three years, significantly increased the federal funds rate during 2022 and has indicated that further rate increases may be announced in the short-term to combat rising inflation in the United States. Such rate increases have corresponding impact to our costs of borrowing and may have an adverse impact on our ability to raise funds through the offering of our securities or through the issuance of debt due to higher debt capital costs, diminished credit availability and less favorable equity markets. Any significant additional federal fund rate increases may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. The extent to which these factors will impact our business and financial results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time due to the rapid evolution of this uncertain situation. Rising inflation may adversely affect us by increasing costs beyond what we can recover through price increases. The United States and other large global economies experienced historically high inflation during 2022, which has continued into the beginning of 2023. The Federal Reserve Board and other central banks already have raised interest rates more aggressively and to their highest levels in the last four to five decades. Current and future inflationary effects may be driven by, among other things, supply chain disruptions, governmental stimulus or fiscal policies, as well as the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Inflation can materially adversely affect us by increasing the costs of land, materials, labor and other costs required to manage and grow our business. In addition, should inflation rates exceed our fixed escalator percentages in markets where our leases include fixed escalators, our returns could be adversely affected. In an inflationary environment, such as the current economic environment, depending on the terms of our contracts and other economic conditions, we may be unable to raise prices enough to keep up with the rate of inflation or our customers may be unwilling to pay contractual increases, which would reduce our profit margins and returns. If we are unable to increase our prices to offset the effects of inflation, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. Rising inflation rates have also contributed to foreign currency exchange rate volatility, including in several of the markets where we operate. The ongoing impact of inflation may continue to create foreign exchange rate instability in our international markets that could, in turn, depress the value of that market’s currency, thereby adversely impacting our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates. The Federal Reserve Board and other central banks have recently raised interest rates aggressively, to their highest levels in the last four to five decades. The combination of higher interest rates and high inflation could lead to an extended economic downturn, which could reduce our ability to incur debt or access capital and impact our results of operations and financial condition even after these conditions improve. 15 Table of Contents Restrictive covenants in the agreements related to our securitization transactions, our credit facilities and our debt securities could materially and adversely affect our business by limiting flexibility, and we may be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock, which may jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a REIT. The agreements related to our securitization transactions include operating covenants and other restrictions customary for loans subject to rated securitizations. Among other things, the borrowers under the agreements are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets. A failure to comply with the covenants in the agreements could prevent the borrowers from taking certain actions with respect to the secured assets and could prevent the borrowers from distributing any excess cash from the operation of such assets to us. If the borrowers were to default on any of the loans, the servicer on such loan could seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of the secured assets, in which case we could lose such assets and the cash flow associated with such assets. The agreements for our credit facilities also contain restrictive covenants and leverage and other financial maintenance tests that could limit our ability to take various actions, including incurring additional debt, guaranteeing indebtedness or making distributions to stockholders, including our required REIT distributions, and engaging in various types of transactions, including mergers, acquisitions and sales of assets. Additionally, our credit facilities restrict our and our subsidiaries’ ability to incur liens securing our or their indebtedness. These covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, new tower or other communications infrastructure development, mergers and acquisitions or other opportunities. Our credit agreements also contain cross-default and/or cross-acceleration provisions, which may be triggered if we default on certain indebtedness in excess of certain thresholds. In the event of such a default, the resulting cross-defaults or cross-accelerations could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Further, reporting and information covenants in our credit agreements and indentures require that we provide financial and operating information within certain time periods. If we are unable to provide the required information on a timely basis, we would be in breach of these covenants. For more information regarding the covenants and requirements discussed above, please see Item 7 of this Annual Report under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Factors Affecting Sources of Liquidity” and note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. We also enter into hedges for certain debt instruments, which may have an adverse impact on our results to the extent that the counterparties do not perform as expected at the inception of each hedge. We may be adversely affected by changes in LIBOR reporting practices, the method in which LIBOR is determined or the use of alternative reference rates. The United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”), which regulates the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), announced plans to phase out certain LIBOR rates by June 2023. As contemplated, the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot be assured after June 2023, and LIBOR will cease to exist or otherwise be unsuitable for benchmarking. While our bank facilities contain fallback provisions to establish an alternative rate in the event LIBOR is unavailable, the elimination of LIBOR could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Financial institutions may replace LIBOR with a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”). In April 2018, the United States Federal Reserve commenced publishing SOFR; however, SOFR is calculated differently from LIBOR and has inherent differences, which could give rise to uncertainties, including the limited historical data and volatility in the benchmark rates. No consensus exists as to what may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, whether LIBOR rates will cease to be published or supported before June 2023 or whether any additional reforms to LIBOR may be enacted in the United Kingdom or elsewhere. Furthermore, the use of an alternative rate could result in increased costs, including increased interest expense, and increased borrowing and hedging costs in the future. We cannot predict the effect of the FCA’s decision not to sustain LIBOR or, if changes ultimately are made to LIBOR, the effect those changes may have on our interest expense related to borrowings under our bank facilities, certain other debt service obligations and interest swap agreements, which could potentially negatively impact our financial condition. Risks Related to Laws and Regulations Our business, and that of our customers, is subject to laws, regulations and administrative and judicial decisions, and changes thereto, that could restrict our ability to operate our business as we currently do or impact our competitive landscape. Our business, and that of our customers, is subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws, treaties and regulations and administrative and judicial decisions. In certain jurisdictions, these regulations, laws and treaties could be applied or be enforced retroactively. Zoning authorities and community organizations are sometimes opposed to the construction of communications sites in their communities, which can delay, prevent or increase the cost of new tower construction, modifications, additions of new antennas to a site or site upgrades, thereby limiting our ability to respond to customer demands. 16 Table of Contents Existing or new regulatory policies, regulations or laws may materially and adversely affect the timing, cost or completion of our communications sites or result in changes in the competitive landscape that may negatively affect our business. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to litigants or result in decreased revenue. In addition, in certain jurisdictions, we and certain of our customers are required to pay annual license fees, which may be subject to substantial increases by the government, or new fees may be enacted and applied retroactively. Governmental licenses may also be subject to periodic renewal and additional conditions to receive or maintain such license. Additionally, we have government customers for several of our communications sites and data centers, which subjects us to risks including early termination, audits, investigations, sanctions and penalties. Furthermore, the tax laws, regulations, applicable license terms and conditions, and interpretations governing our business, and that of our customers, in jurisdictions where we operate, may change at any time, potentially with retroactive effect. Due to the evolving nature of global tax laws and regulations and compliance approaches, it is currently not possible to assess the ultimate impact of these actions on our financial statements, but these actions could have an impact on our financial results. This includes changes in tax laws, transfer pricing regulations, spectrum use terms, administrative compliance guidance or judicial interpretations thereof. For example, the definition and application of adjusted gross revenue (“AGR”) in India and associated fees and charges may have a material financial impact on certain of our customers which could affect their ability to perform their obligations under agreements with us. Changes in laws, regulations and judicial decisions, such as the ongoing Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) legislative developments regarding global minimum tax rules, could have a more significant impact on us as a REIT relative to other REITs due to the nature of our business and our use of taxable REIT subsidiaries. These factors could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. Our foreign operations are subject to economic, political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position, including risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Our international business operations and our potential expansion into additional new markets in the future expose us to potential adverse financial and operational problems not typically experienced in the United States. We anticipate that revenues from our international operations will continue to grow. Accordingly, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally, including: • uncertain, inconsistent or changing laws, regulations, rulings or methodologies impacting our existing and anticipated international operations, fees or other requirements directed specifically at the ownership and operation of communications infrastructure or our international acquisitions, any of which laws, fees or requirements may be applied retroactively or with significant delay; • failure to retain our tax status or to obtain an expected tax status for which we have applied; • expropriation resulting in government takeover of customer operations or governmental regulation restricting foreign ownership or requiring reversion or divestiture; • laws or regulations that tax or otherwise restrict repatriation of earnings or other funds or otherwise limit distributions of capital; • changes in a specific country’s or region’s political or economic conditions, including inflation or currency devaluation; • changes to zoning regulations or construction laws, which could be applied retroactively to our existing communications infrastructure; • actions restricting or revoking our customers’ spectrum licenses, or alterations or interpretations thereof, or suspending or terminating business under prior licenses; • failure to comply with anti-bribery laws such as the FCPA or similar local anti-bribery laws, or the Office of Foreign Assets Control requirements; • failure to comply with data privacy laws or other protections of employee health and personal information; • material site issues related to security, fuel availability and reliability of electrical grids; 17 Table of Contents • significant increases in, or implementation of new, license surcharges on our revenue; • loss of key personnel, including expatriates, in markets where talent is difficult or expensive to acquire; and • price-setting or other similar laws or regulations for the sharing of passive infrastructure. We also face risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, including those arising from the impacts of the current inflationary and high interest rate environment on the global economy and markets and those arising from our operations, investments and financing transactions related to our international business. Volatility in foreign currency exchange rates can also affect our ability to plan, forecast and budget for our international operations and expansion efforts. Our revenues earned from our international operations are primarily denominated in their respective local currencies. We have not historically engaged in significant currency hedging activities relating to our non-U.S. Dollar operations, and a weakening of these foreign currencies against the U.S. Dollar would negatively impact our reported revenues, operating profits and income. We may be adversely affected by regulations related to climate change. Efforts to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, the use of fossil fuels or requirement to use alternative fuel to power energy resources that serve our data centers or the generators we use in our emerging markets to deliver primary power to our customers may have direct or indirect effects on our business by increasing the cost of compliance. In addition, there is an increased focus by many governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and other stakeholders regarding environmental and energy policies relating to climate change, greenhouse gas emissions and other climate-related matters. These governmental initiatives are becoming more stringent and may require us and our customers to make capital expenditures, such as investing in renewable energy solutions or internal compliance systems, which would result in increased costs for us and our customers. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or other requirements imposed on us could also lead to fines and/or lost revenue. In 2021, we adopted science-based greenhouse gas reduction targets, which were approved by the Science Based Targets initiative and are in line with the goals set forth in the 2015 Paris Agreement. Our ability to achieve these goals are based on several factors, some of which are outside of our control including changing regulatory requirements, the pace of changes in technology and the availability of requisite financing. In addition, to meet our goals, we may be required to expend significant resources to meet them, which could increase our operational costs. We cannot guarantee that we will achieve our announced environmental, social and governance goals and initiatives. In addition, consumers’ perceptions of our efforts to achieve these goals often differ widely and present risks to our reputation and brand. Failing to meet these goals could result in customer dissatisfaction and damage to our reputation with our key stakeholders, which could in turn adversely impact our results of operations, reputation, financial condition and stock price. If we fail to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT, we will be subject to tax at corporate income tax rates, which may substantially reduce funds otherwise available, and even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may face tax liabilities that impact earnings and available cash flow. Commencing with the taxable year beginning January 1, 2012, we have operated as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. Qualification for taxation as a REIT requires the application of certain highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), which provisions may change from time to time, to our operations as well as various factual determinations concerning matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. Further, tax legislation may adversely affect our ability to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT or the benefits or desirability of remaining so qualified. There are few judicial or administrative interpretations of the relevant provisions of the Code. If, in any taxable year, we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT and are not entitled to relief under the Code: • we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders and would be subject to federal and state income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates, which could be substantial in amount, and may require us to borrow additional funds or liquidate some investments to pay any additional tax liability and, accordingly, may reduce funds available for other purposes; and • we will be disqualified from REIT tax treatment for the four taxable years immediately following the year during which we were so disqualified. We are subject to certain federal, state, local and foreign taxes on our income and assets, including taxes on any undistributed income and state, local or foreign income, franchise, property and transfer taxes. While state and local income tax regimes often parallel the U.S. federal income tax regime for REITs, many of these jurisdictions differ in their treatment of REITs. For example, some state and local jurisdictions currently or in the future may limit or eliminate a REIT’s deduction for dividends 18 Table of Contents paid, which could increase our income tax expense. We are also subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and state, local and foreign tax authorities. The results of an audit and examination of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures may have an adverse effect on our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability. Furthermore, we have owned and may from time to time own direct and indirect ownership interests in subsidiary REITs, which must also comply with the same REIT requirements that we must satisfy, together with all other rules applicable to REITs. If the subsidiary REIT is determined to have failed to qualify for taxation as a REIT and certain relief provisions do not apply, then the subsidiary REIT would be subject to federal income tax, which tax we would economically bear along with applicable penalties and interest. In addition, our ownership of shares in such subsidiary REIT would fail to be a qualifying asset for purposes of the asset tests applicable to REITs and any dividend income or gains derived by us from such subsidiary REIT may cease to be treated as income that qualifies for purposes of the 75% gross income test. These consequences could have a material adverse effect on our ability to comply with the REIT income and asset tests, and thus our ability to qualify for taxation as a REIT. Complying with REIT requirements may limit our flexibility or cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities. Our use of TRSs enables us to engage in non-REIT qualifying business activities. Under the Code, no more than 20% of the value of the assets of a REIT may be represented by securities of one or more TRSs and no more than 25% of the value of the assets of the REIT may be represented by non-qualifying assets (including securities of one or more TRSs). This limitation may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments or take advantage of acquisition opportunities, including the purchase of non-qualifying assets, the expansion of non-real estate activities and investments in the businesses to be conducted by our TRSs, and to that extent limit our opportunities and our flexibility to change our business strategy. Further, as a REIT, we must distribute to our stockholders an amount equal to at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain). To meet our annual distribution requirements, we may be required to distribute amounts that may otherwise be used for our operations, including amounts that may otherwise be invested in future acquisitions, capital expenditures or repayment of debt. As no more than 25% of our gross income may consist of dividend income from our TRSs and other non-qualifying types of income, our ability to receive distributions from our TRSs may be limited, which may impact our ability to fund distributions to our stockholders or to use income of our TRSs to fund other investments. In addition, the majority of our income and cash flows from our TRSs are generated from our international operations. In many cases, there are local withholding taxes and currency controls that may impact our ability or willingness to repatriate funds to the United States to help satisfy REIT distribution requirements. We could have liability under environmental and occupational safety and health laws. Our operations are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations, including those relating to the management, use, storage, disposal, emission and remediation of, and exposure to, hazardous and non-hazardous substances, materials and wastes. As the owner, lessee or operator of real property and facilities, including generators, we may be liable for substantial costs of investigation, removal or remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous materials, and for damages and costs relating to off-site migration of hazardous materials, without regard to whether we, as the owner, lessee or operator, knew of, or were responsible for, the contamination. We may also be liable for certain costs of remediating contamination at third-party sites to which we sent waste for disposal, even if the original disposal may have complied with all legal requirements at the time. Many of these laws and regulations contain information reporting and record keeping requirements. We may not be at all times in compliance with all environmental requirements. Further, our data center properties are subject to various federal, state and local regulations, such as state and local fire and life safety regulations and ADA federal requirements. We may be subject to potentially significant fines or penalties if we fail to comply with any of these requirements. The requirements of the environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and could become more stringent in the future. In certain jurisdictions, these laws and regulations could be applied retroactively or be broadened to cover situations or persons not currently considered. It is possible that these requirements will change or that liabilities will arise in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. While we maintain environmental and workers’ compensation insurance, we may not have adequate insurance to cover all costs, fines or penalties. Risks Related to the Operation of Our Business 19 Table of Contents Our towers, fiber networks, data centers or computer systems may be affected by natural disasters (including as a result of climate change) and other unforeseen events for which our insurance may not provide adequate coverage or result in increased insurance premiums. Our towers, fiber networks, data centers and computer systems are subject to risks associated with natural disasters, such as hurricanes, ice and windstorms, tornadoes, floods, earthquakes and wildfires, as well as other unforeseen events, such as the potential adverse effects of pandemics and acts of terrorism. During the past several years, we have seen an increase in severe weather events and expect this trend to continue due to climate change. Further, environmental liabilities, such as contamination, asbestos-containing building materials and mold or other air quality issues at some of our data centers, could arise and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and performance. Any damage or destruction to, or inability to access, our towers, fiber networks, data centers or computer systems may cause supply chain delays or impact our ability to provide services to our customers and lead to customer loss, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition and also, our communications sites could be subject to attacks instigated by claims that the deployment of 5G networks is linked to adverse health effects. While we maintain insurance coverage for certain natural disasters, we may not have adequate insurance to cover the associated costs of repair or reconstruction of sites or fiber for a major future event, lost revenue, including from new customers that could have been added to our towers, fiber networks or data centers but for the event, or other costs to remediate the impact of a significant event, such was wildfire damage caused by our towers. Further, we may be liable for damage caused by towers that collapse for any number of reasons including structural deficiencies, which could harm our reputation and require us to incur costs for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage. If we, or third parties on which we rely, experience technology failures, including cybersecurity incidents or the loss of personally identifiable information, we may incur substantial costs and suffer other negative consequences, which may include reputational damage. As part of our normal business activities, including in our data centers, we rely on energy systems, cooling systems, communication networks, information technology and other computing resources. We may be vulnerable to physical or cybersecurity breaches that could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and operating results. We face risks associated with unauthorized access to our or our vendors’ computer systems, loss or destruction of data, computer viruses, malware, distributed denial-of-service attacks or other malicious activities. These threats may result from human error, equipment failure or fraud or malice on the part of employees or third parties. A party who is able to compromise the security measures on our or our vendors’ networks or the security of our communications infrastructure could misappropriate either our proprietary information or the personal information of our customers or our employees, or cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations or our customers’ operations. As we provide assurances to our customers that we provide a high level of security, such a compromise could be particularly harmful to our brand and reputation. We may be required to expend significant capital and resources to protect against such threats or to alleviate problems caused by breaches in security. Globally, the frequency, severity and sophistication of cybersecurity incidents have increased, and these trends may continue, especially during times of geopolitical tension or instability among countries, including, for example, the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, from which a number of recent cybersecurity events have been alleged to have originated. Such cyber-attacks could be in the form of espionage, phishing campaigns and otherwise. We are continuously evaluating and enhancing our cybersecurity and information security systems and creating new systems and processes. However, there can be no assurance that these measures will be effective in preventing or limiting the impact of future cybersecurity incidents. As techniques used to breach security grow in frequency and sophistication, and are generally not recognized until launched against a target, we, or our vendors, may not be able to promptly detect that a cyber breach has occurred or implement security measures in a timely manner. If and when implemented, we, or our vendors, may not be able to determine the extent to which these measures could be circumvented. Any breaches that may occur could expose us to increased risk of lawsuits, regulatory penalties, loss of existing or potential customers, damage relating to loss of proprietary information, harm to our reputation and increases in our security costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and operating results. We offer managed services in certain of our data centers where we provide “remote hands” services for our customers. The access to our customers’ networks and data, which is gained from these services, creates some risk that our customers’ networks or data will be improperly accessed. If we were held responsible for any such breach, it could result in a significant loss to us, including damage to our customer relationships, harm to our brand and reputation and legal liability. Additionally, while we maintain insurance coverage for cybersecurity incidents, we may not have adequate insurance to cover the associated costs in the event of a breach resulting in loss of data, such as personally identifiable information or other such data protected by data privacy or other laws, and we may be liable for damages, fines and penalties for such losses under applicable regulatory frameworks. 20 Table of Contents Although we and our vendors have disaster recovery programs and security measures in place, if our computer systems and our backup systems are compromised, degraded, damaged, breached or otherwise cease to function properly, we could suffer interruptions in our operations, including our ability to correctly record, process and report financial information, our customers’ network availability may be impacted or we could unintentionally allow misappropriation of proprietary or confidential information (including information about our customers or landlords, or customer information on our fiber, data center or managed networks businesses), which could result in a loss of revenue, damage to our reputation, damage to our customer and vendor relationships, litigation, regulatory investigations and penalties under existing or future data privacy laws and require us to incur significant costs to remediate or otherwise resolve these issues. Our costs could increase and our revenues could decrease due to perceived health risks from radio emissions, especially if these perceived risks are substantiated. Public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and other wireless communications technology could slow the growth of wireless companies, which could in turn slow our growth. In particular, negative public perception of, and regulations regarding, these perceived health risks, including claims that the deployment of 5G networks is linked to adverse health effects, could undermine the market acceptance of wireless communications services and increase opposition to the development and expansion of tower sites. If a scientific study, court decision or government agency ruling resulted in a finding that radio frequency emissions pose health risks to consumers, it could negatively impact our customers and the market for wireless services, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. We do not maintain any significant insurance with respect to these matters. If we are unable to protect our rights to the land under our towers and buildings in which our data centers are located, it could adversely affect our business and operating results. Our real property interests relating to our towers consist primarily of leasehold and sub-leasehold interests, fee interests, easements, licenses and rights-of-way. A loss of these interests at a particular tower site may interfere with our ability to operate that tower site and generate revenues. For various reasons, we may not always have the ability to access, analyze and verify all information regarding titles and other issues prior to completing an acquisition of communications sites, which can affect our rights to access and operate a site. From time to time, we also experience disputes with landowners regarding the terms of easements or ground agreements for land under towers, which can affect our ability to access and operate tower sites. Further, for various reasons, landowners may not want to renew their ground agreements with us, they may lose their rights to the land, or they may transfer their land interests to third parties, including ground lease aggregators, which could affect our ability to renew ground agreements on commercially viable terms. A significant number of the communications sites in our portfolio are located on land we lease pursuant to long-term operating leases. Further, for various reasons, title to property interests in some of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate may not be as certain as title to our property interests in the United States. Our inability to protect our rights to the land under our towers may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. We do not own the buildings for all of our data centers and our business could be harmed if we are unable to renew the leases for these data centers at favorable terms or at all, though we generally have the right to extend the terms of our leases when the primary terms of the leases expire. Failure to increase operating revenues to sufficiently offset any potential increase in lease costs, including as a result of the current inflationary environment, would adversely impact our operating income. We could also lose customers due to the disruptions in their operations caused by our inability to renew our data center leases. Additionally, we rely on our landlords for basic maintenance of our leased data centers. If such landlords have not maintained our leased properties sufficiently, we may be forced into an early exit from one or more of these data centers, which could be disruptive to our business. If we are unable or choose not to exercise our rights to purchase towers that are subject to lease and sublease agreements at the end of the applicable period, our cash flows derived from those towers will be eliminated. Our communications real estate portfolio includes towers that we operate pursuant to lease and sublease agreements that include a purchase option at the end of the lease period. We may not have the required available capital to exercise our right to purchase the towers at the end of the applicable period, or we may choose, for business or other reasons, not to do so. If we do not exercise these purchase rights, and are unable to extend the lease or sublease or otherwise acquire an interest that would allow us to continue to operate these towers after the applicable period, we will lose the cash flows derived from the towers. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES 21 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2022, we owned and operated a portfolio of 224,768 communications sites, including 1,713 DAS networks. See the table in Item 7 of this Annual Report, under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Executive Overview” for more detailed information on the geographic locations of our communications sites. In addition, we own property interests that we lease to communications service providers and third-party tower operators in Canada and the United States, which are included in our U.S. & Canada property segment, and in Australia and New Zealand, which are included in our Asia-Pacific property segment, and also own and operate data center facilities and related assets in the United States, which are included in our Data Centers segment. Our interests in our communications sites consist of a variety of ownership interests, including leases created by long-term ground lease agreements, easements, licenses or rights-of-way granted by government entities. A typical tower site consists of a compound enclosing the tower site, a tower structure and, in some cases, one or more equipment shelters that house a variety of transmitting, receiving and switching equipment. In addition, many of our international sites typically include power generators and batteries, which are often used for primary power in lieu of an electric grid connection in select markets. The principal types of our towers are guyed, self-supporting lattice and monopole, and rooftop towers in our international markets. • A guyed tower includes a series of cables attaching separate levels of the tower to anchor foundations in the ground and can reach heights of up to 2,000 feet. A typical guyed broadcast tower can be located a tract of land of up to 20 acres. • A self-supporting lattice tower typically tapers from the bottom up and usually has three or four legs. A lattice tower can reach heights of up to 1,000 feet, although most lattice structures are between 200 and 400 feet. Depending on the height of the tower, a lattice tower site can be located on a tract of land of 10,000 square feet for a rural site or fewer than 2,500 square feet for a metropolitan site. • A monopole tower is a tubular structure that is used primarily to address space constraints or aesthetic concerns. Monopoles typically have heights ranging from 50 to 200 feet. A monopole tower site used in metropolitan areas for a typical wireless communications tower can be located on a tract of land of fewer than 2,500 square feet. • Rooftop towers are primarily used in metropolitan areas in our Asia-Pacific, Africa, Europe and Latin America markets, where locations for traditional tower structures are unavailable. Rooftop towers typically have heights ranging from 10 to 100 feet. U.S. & Canada Property Segment Encumbered Sites . As of December 31, 2022, the loan underlying the securitization transactions completed in March 2013 and March 2018 (the “2013 Securitization” and the “2018 Securitization”, respectively, and together, the “Trust Securitizations”) is secured by mortgages, deeds of trust and deeds to secure the loan on substantially all of the 5,102 broadcast and wireless communications towers and related assets owned by the borrowers (the “Trust Sites”) and the secured revenue notes issued in a private transaction completed in May 2015 (the “2015 Securitization”) are secured by mortgages, deeds of trust and deeds to secure debt on substantially all of the 3,516 communications sites owned by subsidiaries of the issuer (the “2015 Secured Sites”). There are no encumbered sites in our Asia-Pacific, Africa, Europe or Latin America property segments or in our Data Centers segment. Ground Leases. Of the 223,055 towers in our portfolio as of December 31, 2022, approximately 90% were located on land we lease. Typically, we seek to enter long-term ground leases, which have initial terms of approximately five to ten years with one or more automatic or exercisable renewal periods. As a result, 43% of the ground leases for our sites have a final expiration date of 2032 and beyond. Customers . Our customers are primarily wireless service providers, broadcasters and other companies in a variety of industries. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our top three customers by total revenue were T-Mobile (18%), AT&T (17%) and Verizon Wireless (11%). Across most of our markets, our tenant leases for our communications sites with wireless carriers have initial non-cancellable terms of five to ten years with multiple renewal terms. As a result, approximately 56% of our current tenant leases have a renewal date of 2028 or beyond. Data Centers. We own and operate data center facilities and related assets, and as of December 31, 2022, our data center portfolio consisted of 28 data center facilities across ten United States markets, including the assets acquired as part of the CoreSite Acquisition, across 3.1 million net rentable square feet (“NRSF”). Offices. Our principal corporate headquarters is leased and located in Boston, Massachusetts, where we currently lease approximately 40,000 square feet of office space. We also own or have entered into long-term leases for the majority of our 22 Table of Contents facilities in international and regional locations for the management and operation of our property and services businesses, including offices in each of our U.S. & Canada, Asia-Pacific, Africa, Europe, Latin America and Data Centers segments. Our international headquarters is leased and located in Amsterdam, Netherlands. We believe that our owned and leased facilities are suitable and adequate to meet our anticipated needs. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS We periodically become involved in various claims and lawsuits that are incidental to our business. In the opinion of management, after consultation with counsel, there are no matters currently pending that would, in the event of an adverse outcome, have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Our common stock is listed on the NYSE under the ticker symbol AMT. As of February 16, 2023, we had 465,646,055 outstanding shares of common stock and 137 holders of record. Dividends As a REIT, we must annually distribute to our stockholders an amount equal to at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain). Generally, we have distributed and expect to continue to distribute all or substantially all of our REIT taxable income after taking into consideration our utilization of net operating losses ( “ NOLs ” ). The amount, timing and frequency of future distributions will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon various factors, a number of which may be beyond our control, including our financial condition and operating cash flows, the amount required to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT and reduce any income and excise taxes that we otherwise would be required to pay, limitations on distributions in our existing and future debt and preferred equity instruments, our ability to utilize NOLs to offset our distribution requirements, limitations on our ability to fund distributions using cash generated through our TRSs and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant.

These programs may be discontinued at any time. ITEM 6. [RESERVED] N/A. 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations that follow are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences could be material to the financial statements. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report and the accompanying notes, and the information set forth under the caption “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” below. We report our results in seven segments – U.S. & Canada property (which includes all assets in the United States and Canada, other than our data center facilities and related assets), Asia-Pacific property, Africa property, Europe property, Latin America property, Data Centers and Services. In evaluating financial performance in each business segment, management uses, among other factors, segment gross margin and segment operating profit (see note 20 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report). Executive Overview We are one of the largest global REITs and a leading independent owner, operator and developer of multitenant communications real estate. Our primary business is the leasing of space on communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, wireless data providers, government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries. In addition to the communications sites in our portfolio, we manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements. We also hold other telecommunications infrastructure, fiber and property interests that we lease primarily to communications service providers and third-party tower operators, and, as discussed further below, we hold a portfolio of highly interconnected data center facilities and related assets in the United States. Our customers include our tenants, licensees and other payers. We refer to the business encompassing the above as our property operations, which accounted for 98% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022 and includes our U.S. & Canada property, Asia-Pacific property, Africa property, Europe property and Latin America property segments and Data Centers segment. We also offer tower-related services in the United States, including site application, zoning and permitting, structural analysis and construction management, which primarily support our site leasing business, including the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites. 26 Table of Contents The following table details the number of communications sites, excluding managed sites, that we owned or operated as of December 31, 2022: Number of Owned Towers Number of Operated Towers (1) Number of Owned DAS Sites U.S. & Canada: Canada 221 — — United States 27,413 15,187 454 U.S. & Canada total 27,634 15,187 454 Asia-Pacific: (2) Bangladesh 481 — — India 76,826 — 822 Philippines 340 — — Asia-Pacific total 77,647 — 822 Africa: Burkina Faso 726 — — Ghana 3,503 657 36 Kenya 3,416 — 9 Niger 860 — — Nigeria 7,562 — — South Africa 2,994 — — Uganda 3,980 — 12 Africa total 23,041 657 57 Europe: France 3,943 303 8 Germany 14,799 — — Poland 57 — — Spain 11,610 — 1 Europe total 30,409 303 9 Latin America: Argentina 497 — 11 Brazil 20,644 2,043 121 Chile 3,728 — 138 Colombia 4,974 — 6 Costa Rica 700 — 2 Mexico 9,560 186 92 Paraguay 1,447 — — Peru 3,948 450 1 Latin America total 45,498 2,679 371 _______________ (1) Approximately 95% of the operated towers are held pursuant to long-term finance leases, including those subject to purchase options. (2) We also control land under carrier or other third-party communications sites in Australia and New Zealand, which provide recurring cash flows through tenant leasing arrangements. As of December 31, 2022, our property portfolio included 28 operating data center facilities across ten markets in the United States that collectively comprise approximately 3.1 million NRSF of data center space, as detailed below: 27 Table of Contents Number of Data Centers Total NRSF (1) (in thousands) San Francisco Bay, CA 8 940 Los Angeles, CA 3 670 Northern Virginia, VA 5 536 New York, NY 2 250 Chicago, IL 2 216 Boston, MA 1 143 Denver, CO 2 35 Miami, FL 2 47 Orlando, FL 1 126 Atlanta, GA 2 95 Total 28 3,058 _______________ (1) Excludes approximately 0.4 million of office and light-industrial NRSF acquired as part of the CoreSite Acquisition. In most of our markets, our tenant leases for our communications sites with wireless carriers generally have initial non-cancellable terms of five to ten years with multiple renewal terms. Accordingly, the vast majority of the revenue generated by our property operations during the year ended December 31, 2022 was recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. Most of our tenant leases for our communications sites have provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease, typically based on an annual fixed escalation (averaging approximately 3% in the United States) or an inflationary index in most of our international markets, or a combination of both. In addition, certain of our tenant leases provide for additional revenue primarily to cover costs, such as ground rent or power and fuel costs. Based upon existing customer leases and foreign currency exchange rates as of December 31, 2022, we expect to generate over $62 billion of non-cancellable customer lease revenue over future periods, before the impact of straight-line lease accounting. Following the court rulings by the Supreme Court of India regarding carriers’ obligations for the AGR fees and charges prescribed by such court, we continue to experience variability and a level of uncertainty in collections in India. As further discussed in Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption “Risk Factors—A substantial portion of our current and projected revenue is derived from a small number of customers, and we are sensitive to adverse changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our customers,” in the third quarter of 2022, our largest customer in India, VIL, communicated that it would make partial payments of its contractual amounts owed to us and indicated that it would continue to make partial payments for the remainder of 2022. In late 2022, VIL had communicated its intent to resume payments in full under its contractual obligations owed to us beginning on January 1, 2023. However, in early 2023, VIL communicated that it would not be able to resume payments in full of its contractual obligations owed to us, and that it would instead continue to make partial payments. We considered these recent developments and the uncertainty with respect to amounts owed under our tenant leases when conducting our annual impairment assessments for long-lived assets and goodwill in India. As a result, we determined that certain fixed and intangible assets had been impaired during the year ended December 31, 2022. An impairment of $97.0 million was taken on tower and network location intangible assets in India. We also impaired the tenant-related intangible assets for VIL, which resulted in an impairment of $411.6 million. We expect to periodically evaluate the carrying value of our Indian assets, which may result in the realization of additional impairment expense or other similar charges. For more information on impairments in India, please see the information under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” included in this Annual Report. In October 2022, and as subsequently amended in February 2023, ATC TIPL and VIL notified the stock exchange of India that both parties have board approvals in relation to an issuance of convertible debentures pursuant to which, in exchange for VIL’s payment of certain amounts towards accounts receivables, ATC TIPL shall pay equivalent amounts towards subscription to convertible debentures issued by VIL. The convertible debentures are to be repaid by VIL with interest and ATC TIPL has the option to convert the debentures into equity of VIL. The issuance of the debentures is subject to certain conditions precedent, which may not be met. As a result of the challenging business environment in India, we are exploring various strategic alternatives aimed at potentially reducing our exposure there, including the sale of an equity interest in our India operations to one or more private investors. Any such completed transaction could have a material impact on our financial statements and on our results of operations in the period in which any such transaction occurred. There can be no assurance that any such strategic alternative will be implemented and, if so implemented, as to the timing thereof, and any such proposed transaction would be subject to conditions, including regulatory approvals in India. 28 Table of Contents The revenues generated by our property operations may be affected by cancellations of existing tenant leases. As discussed above, most of our tenant leases with wireless carriers and broadcasters are multiyear contracts, which typically are non-cancellable; however, in some instances, a lease may be cancelled upon the payment of a termination fee. Revenue lost from either tenant lease cancellations or the non-renewal of leases or rent renegotiations, which we refer to as churn, has historically not had a material adverse effect on the revenues generated by our consolidated property operations. During the year ended December 31, 2022, churn was approximately 5% of our tenant billings, primarily driven by churn in our U.S. & Canada property segment, as discussed below. We expect that our churn rate in our U.S. & Canada property segment will remain elevated for a period of several years through 2025 due to contractual lease cancellations and non-renewals by T-Mobile, including legacy Sprint Corporation leases, pursuant to the terms of the T-Mobile MLA entered into in September 2020. We will continue to actively monitor the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and may take further actions as may be required by governmental authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers and business partners. Property Operations Revenue Growth . Due to our diversified communications site portfolio, our tenant lease rates vary considerably depending upon numerous factors, including, but not limited to, amount, type and position of tenant equipment on the tower, remaining tower capacity and tower location. We measure the remaining tower capacity by assessing several factors, including tower height, tower type, environmental conditions, existing equipment on the tower and zoning and permitting regulations in effect in the jurisdiction where the tower is located. In many instances, tower capacity can be increased with relatively modest tower augmentation capital expenditures, which are often reimbursed to us. The primary factors affecting the revenue growth of our property segments are: • Growth in tenant billings, including: • New revenue attributable to leasing additional space on our sites (“colocations”) and lease amendments; • Contractual rent escalations on existing tenant leases, net of churn; and • New revenue attributable to leases in place on day one on sites acquired or constructed since the beginning of the prior-year period. • Revenue growth from our Data Centers segment in the United States, including rental and power revenue from new lease commencements and expansions, contractual rent and power escalations on existing leases, mark-to-market increases on renewing leases and increased interconnection services and solutions. • Revenue growth from other items, including additional tenant payments primarily to cover costs, such as ground rent or power and fuel costs included in certain tenant leases (“pass-through”), straight-line revenue and decommissioning. We continue to believe that our site leasing revenue, which makes up the vast majority of our property segment revenue, is likely to increase due to the growing use of wireless services globally and our ability to meet the corresponding incremental demand for our communications real estate. By adding new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our sites, we are able to increase these sites’ utilization and profitability. We believe the majority of our site leasing activity will continue to come from wireless service providers, with tenants in a number of other industries contributing incremental leasing demand. Our site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with new business opportunities, which have historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth as wireless carriers seek to increase the coverage and capacity of their existing networks, while also deploying next generation wireless technologies. In addition, we intend to continue to supplement our organic growth by selectively developing or acquiring new sites in our existing and new markets where we can achieve our risk-adjusted return on investment objectives. Property Operations Organic Revenue Growth . Consistent with our strategy to increase the utilization and return on investment from our sites, our objective is to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants through colocation and lease amendments. Our ability to lease additional space on our sites is primarily a function of the rate at which wireless carriers and other tenants deploy capital to improve and expand their wireless networks. This rate, in turn, is influenced by the growth of wireless services, the penetration of advanced wireless devices, the level of emphasis on network quality and capacity in carrier competition, the financial performance of our tenants and their access to capital and general economic conditions. According to industry data, recent aggregate annual wireless capital spending in the United States has averaged at least $30 billion, resulting in consistent demand for our sites. Based on industry research and projections, we expect that a number of key industry trends will result in incremental revenue opportunities for us: • In less advanced wireless markets where network deployments are in earlier stages, we expect these deployments to drive demand for our tower space as carriers seek to expand their footprints and increase the scope and density of their 29 Table of Contents networks. We have established operations in many of these markets at the early stages of wireless development, which we believe will enable us to meaningfully participate in these deployments over the long term. • Subscribers’ use of mobile data continues to grow rapidly given increasing smartphone and other advanced device penetration, the proliferation of bandwidth-intensive applications on these devices and the continuing evolution of the mobile ecosystem. We believe carriers will be compelled to deploy additional equipment on existing networks while also rolling out more advanced wireless networks to address coverage and capacity needs resulting from this increasing mobile data usage. • The deployment of advanced mobile technology, such as 4G and 5G, will provide higher speed data services and further enable fixed broadband substitution. As a result, we expect that our tenants will continue deploying additional equipment across their existing networks. • Wireless service providers compete based on the quality of their networks, which is driven by capacity and coverage. To maintain or improve their network performance as overall network usage increases, our tenants continue to deploy additional equipment across their existing sites while also adding new cell sites. We anticipate increasing network densification over the next several years, as existing network density is anticipated to be insufficient to account for rapidly increasing levels of wireless data usage. • Wireless service providers continue to acquire additional spectrum, and as a result are expected to add additional sites and equipment to their networks as they seek to optimize their network configuration and utilize additional spectrum. We expect this to be particularly relevant in the context of higher-band spectrum such as 2.5 gigahertz (GHz) and C-Band being deployed for 5G, as these spectrum assets tend to have more limited propagation characteristics compared to the lower-band spectrum that has historically been deployed on our towers. • Next generation technologies requiring wireless connectivity have the potential to provide incremental revenue opportunities for us. These technologies may include edge computing functionality, autonomous vehicle networks and a number of other internet-of-things, or IoT, applications, as well as other potential use cases for wireless services. These technologies may create new and complementary use cases for our communications real estate over time, although these use cases are currently in nascent stages. • Continued data growth and emerging high-performance, latency-sensitive applications will drive an increased need for reliable, secure and interconnected data center solutions. We believe these trends will result in incremental utilization and interconnection demand at our data center facilities. As part of our international expansion initiatives, we have targeted markets in various stages of network development to diversify our international exposure and position us to benefit from a number of different wireless technology deployments over the long term. In addition, we have focused on building relationships with large multinational carriers to increase the opportunities for growth or mutually beneficial transactional opportunities across common markets. We believe that consistent carrier network investments across our international markets will, over the long term, position us to generate meaningful organic revenue growth going forward. In emerging markets, such as Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Ghana, India, Kenya, Niger, Nigeria, the Philippines and Uganda, wireless networks tend to be significantly less advanced than those in the United States, and initial voice networks continue to be deployed in certain underdeveloped areas. A majority of consumers in these markets still utilize basic wireless services and advanced device penetration remains low. In more developed urban locations within these markets, mobile data usage tends to be higher and advanced network deployments are further along. Carriers are focused on completing voice network build-outs while increasing investments in data networks as mobile data usage and smartphone penetration within their customer bases begin to accelerate. In India, the ongoing transition from 2G technology to 4G technology has included a period of carrier consolidation, whereby the number of carriers operating in the marketplace has been reduced through mergers, acquisitions and select carrier exits from the marketplace, which we believe is now substantially complete. We believe that this consolidation process has resulted in an industry structure that is more constructive for both the wireless carriers and communications infrastructure over the long-term. In markets with rapidly evolving network technology, such as South Africa, Poland and most of the countries in Latin America where we do business, initial voice networks, for the most part, have already been built out, and carriers are increasingly focused on 4G network deployments. Consumers in these regions are increasingly adopting smartphones and other advanced devices, in particular as lower cost smartphones become increasingly available. As a result, the usage of bandwidth-intensive mobile applications is growing materially. Recent spectrum auctions in these rapidly evolving markets have allowed incumbent carriers to accelerate their data network deployments and have also enabled new entrants to begin initial investments in data networks. Smartphone penetration and wireless data usage in these markets are advancing rapidly, which typically requires that carriers continue to invest in their networks to maintain and augment their quality of service. Finally, in markets with more mature network technology, such as Australia, Canada, Germany, France, New Zealand and Spain, carriers are focused on deploying 4G data networks to account for rapidly increasing wireless data usage among their 30 Table of Contents customer base. With higher smartphone and advanced device penetration and significantly higher per capita data usage, carrier investment in networks is focused on 4G coverage and capacity, as well as the early stages of 5G deployment. We believe that the network technology migration we have seen in the United States, which has led to significantly denser networks and meaningful new business commencements for us over a number of years, will be replicated in our international markets over time. As a result, we expect to be able to leverage our extensive international portfolio of approximately 182,000 communications sites and the relationships we have built with our carrier tenants to drive sustainable, long - term growth. We have master lease agreements with many of our tenants for our communications sites that provide for consistent, long-term revenue and reduce the likelihood of non-contractual churn. Certain of those master lease agreements are comprehensive in nature and further build and augment strong strategic partnerships with our tenants while significantly reducing colocation cycle times, thereby providing our tenants with the ability to rapidly and efficiently deploy equipment on our sites. Demand for our communications infrastructure assets could be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including an increase in network sharing or consolidation among our customers, as set forth in Item 1A of this Annual Report under the captions “Risk Factors—If our customers consolidate their operations, exit their businesses or share site infrastructure to a significant degree, our growth, revenue and ability to generate positive cash flows could be materially and adversely affected” and “Risk Factors—A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of customers, and we are sensitive to adverse changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our customers.” In addition, the emergence and growth of new technologies could reduce demand for our sites, as set forth under the caption “Risk Factors—New technologies or changes in our or a customer’s business model could make our communications infrastructure leasing business less desirable and result in decreasing revenues and operating results.” Further, our customers may be subject to new regulatory policies from time to time that materially and adversely affect the demand for our communications infrastructure assets. Property Operations New Site Revenue Growth. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we grew our portfolio of communications real estate through the acquisition and construction of approximately 7,405 communications sites globally. In a majority of our Asia-Pacific, Africa, Europe and Latin America markets, the revenue generated from newly acquired or constructed sites resulted in increases in both tenant and pass-through revenues (such as ground rent or power and fuel costs) and expenses. We continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire communications real estate portfolios, both domestically and internationally, to determine whether they meet our risk-adjusted hurdle rates and whether we believe we can effectively integrate them into our existing portfolio. New Sites (Acquired or Constructed) 2022 2021 2020 U.S. & Canada 55 170 2,255 Asia-Pacific 4,640 3,780 3,960 Africa 1,680 2,355 1,540 Europe 690 24,775 610 Latin America 340 7,870 1,000 In 2021, we significantly grew our portfolio of data center facilities through the acquisition of over 20 data center facilities and related assets in the United States, including through the CoreSite Acquisition. Property Operations Expenses. Direct operating expenses incurred by our property segments include direct site or facility level expenses and consist primarily of ground rent and power and fuel costs, some or all of which may be passed through to our customers, as well as property taxes and repairs and maintenance expenses. These segment direct operating expenses exclude all segment and corporate selling, general, administrative and development expenses, which are aggregated into one line item entitled Selling, general, administrative and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations. In general, our property segments’ selling, general, administrative and development expenses do not significantly increase as a result of adding incremental customers to our sites or facilities and typically increase only modestly year-over-year. As a result, leasing additional space to new customers on our sites or within our facilities provides significant incremental gross margin and cash flow. We may, however, incur additional segment selling, general, administrative and development expenses as we increase our presence in our existing markets or expand into new markets. Our profit margin growth is therefore positively impacted by the addition of new customers to our sites or facilities but can be temporarily diluted by our development activities. Services Segment Revenue Growth . As we continue to focus on growing our property operations, we anticipate that our services revenue will continue to represent a small percentage of our total revenues. 31 Table of Contents Non-GAAP Financial Measures Included in our analysis of our results of operations are discussions regarding earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and accretion, as adjusted (“Adjusted EBITDA”), Funds From Operations, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“Nareit FFO”) attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders, Consolidated Adjusted Funds From Operations (“Consolidated AFFO”) and AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders. We define Adjusted EBITDA as Net income before Income (loss) from equity method investments; Income tax benefit (provision); Other income (expense); Gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations; Interest expense; Interest income; Other operating income (expense); Depreciation, amortization and accretion; and stock-based compensation expense. Nareit FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders is defined as net income before gains or losses from the sale or disposal of real estate, real estate related impairment charges, real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion and dividends to noncontrolling interests, and including adjustments for (i) unconsolidated affiliates and (ii) noncontrolling interests. In this section, we refer to Nareit FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders as “Nareit FFO (common stockholders).” We define Consolidated AFFO as Nareit FFO (common stockholders) before (i) straight-line revenue and expense; (ii) stock-based compensation expense; (iii) the deferred portion of income tax and other income tax adjustments; (iv) non-real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion; (v) amortization of deferred financing costs, debt discounts and premiums and long-term deferred interest charges; (vi) other income (expense); (vii) gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations; (viii) other operating income (expense); and adjustments for (ix) unconsolidated affiliates and (x) noncontrolling interests, less cash payments related to capital improvements and cash payments related to corporate capital expenditures. We define AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders as Consolidated AFFO, excluding the impact of noncontrolling interests on both Nareit FFO (common stockholders) and the other adjustments included in the calculation of Consolidated AFFO. In this section, we refer to AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders as “AFFO (common stockholders).” Adjusted EBITDA, Nareit FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO and AFFO (common stockholders) are not intended to replace net income or any other performance measures determined in accordance with GAAP. None of Adjusted EBITDA, Nareit FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO or AFFO (common stockholders) represents cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and, therefore, these measures should not be considered indicative of cash flows from operating activities, as a measure of liquidity or a measure of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. Rather, Adjusted EBITDA, Nareit FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO and AFFO (common stockholders) are presented as we believe each is a useful indicator of our current operating performance. We believe that these metrics are useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because (1) each is a key measure used by our management team for decision making purposes and for evaluating our operating segments’ performance; (2) Adjusted EBITDA is a component underlying our credit ratings; (3) Adjusted EBITDA is widely used in the telecommunications real estate sector to measure operating performance as depreciation, amortization and accretion may vary significantly among companies depending upon accounting methods and useful lives, particularly where acquisitions and non-operating factors are involved; (4) Consolidated AFFO and AFFO (common stockholders) are widely used in the telecommunications real estate sector to adjust Nareit FFO (common stockholders) for items that may otherwise cause material fluctuations in Nareit FFO (common stockholders) growth from period to period that would not be representative of the underlying performance of property assets in those periods; (5) each provides investors with a meaningful measure for evaluating our period-to-period operating performance by eliminating items that are not operational in nature; and (6) each provides investors with a measure for comparing our results of operations to those of other companies, particularly those in our industry. Our measurement of Adjusted EBITDA, Nareit FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO and AFFO (common stockholders) may not, however, be fully comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA, Nareit FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO and AFFO (common stockholders) to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, have been included below. 32 Table of Contents Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2020 For a discussion of our 2021 Results of Operations, including a discussion of our financial results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, refer to Part I, Item 7 of our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 25, 2022 (the “2021 Form 10-K”).

(3) In 2015, we incurred charges in connection with certain tax elections wherein MIP Tower Holdings LLC, parent company to Global Tower Partners (“GTP”), would no longer operate as a separate REIT for federal and state income tax purposes. We finalized a settlement related to this tax election during the year ended December 31, 2022. We believe that these related transactions are nonrecurring, and do not believe it is an indication of our operating performance. Accordingly, we believe it is more meaningful to present Consolidated AFFO excluding these amounts. (4) Includes gains on foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations of $449.4 million and $557.9 million, respectively. (5) Primarily includes acquisition-related costs and integration costs. (6) Includes adjustments for the impact on both Nareit FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders as well as the other line items included in the calculation of Consolidated AFFO. Year Ended December 31, 2022 The decrease in net income was primarily due to (i) an increase in depreciation, amortization and accretion expense, (ii) an increase in other operating expense, including an increase in impairment charges of $482.2 million, (iii) an increase in interest expense and (iv) a decrease in gains on foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, partially offset by (a) an increase in our operating profit and (b) a decrease in the income tax provision. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2021 included a loss on retirement of long-term obligations of $25.7 million, attributable to the repayment of the InSite Debt and the 4.70% Notes. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily attributable to an increase in our gross margin and was partially offset by an increase in SG&A, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense, of $110.9 million. The increases in Consolidated AFFO and AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders was primarily attributable to the increase in our operating profit, excluding the impact of straight-line accounting, partially offset by (i) increases in cash paid for taxes and cash paid for interest, (ii) an increase in dividends to noncontrolling interests, including $16.7 million of distributions payable related to the outstanding Stonepeak mandatorily convertible preferred equity, and (iii) an increase in capital improvement capital expenditures. The growth in AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders was also impacted by changes in noncontrolling interests held in Data Centers, Europe and Asia-Pacific since the beginning of the prior-year period. 39 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources For a discussion of our 2021 Liquidity and Capital Resources, including a discussion of cash flows for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, refer to Part I, Item 7 of the 2021 Form 10-K. Overview During the year ended December 31, 2022, we increased our financial flexibility and our ability to grow our business while maintaining our long-term financial policies. Our significant 2022 financing transactions included: • Repayment of debt assumed in connection with the CoreSite Acquisition, including senior unsecured notes previously entered into by CoreSite (the “CoreSite Debt”). • Redemption of our 2.250% senior unsecured notes due 2022 (the “2.250% Notes”) upon their maturity. • Registered public offering in an aggregate amount of $1.3 billion of senior unsecured notes with maturities in 2027 and 2032. • Registered public offering of 9,185,000 shares of our common stock for aggregate net proceeds of $2.3 billion. • The Stonepeak Transaction (as defined and further discussed below) pursuant to which we received an aggregate amount of approximately $3.1 billion. • Repayment of all amounts outstanding under the 2021 USD 364-Day Delayed Draw Term Loan (as defined below). The following table summarizes our liquidity as of December 31, 2022 (in millions): Available under the 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility $ 2,211.3 Available under the 2021 Credit Facility 2,920.0 Letters of credit (34.4) Total available under credit facilities, net 5,096.9 Cash and cash equivalents 2,028.4 Total liquidity $ 7,125.3 Subsequent to December 31, 2022, we made additional net borrowings of $895.0 million under the 2021 Credit Facility (as defined below) and $655.0 million under the 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility (as defined below). The borrowings were used to repay existing indebtedness and for general corporate purposes. Summary cash flow information is set forth below for the years ended December 31, (in millions): 2022 2021 Net cash provided by (used for): Operating activities $ 3,696.2 $ 4,819.9 Investing activities (2,355.2) (20,692.2) Financing activities (1,423.2) 16,424.5 Net effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash (120.4) (70.3) Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash $ (202.6) $ 481.9 We use our cash flows to fund our operations and investments in our business, including maintenance and improvements, communications site construction, managed network installations and acquisitions. Additionally, we use our cash flows to make distributions, including distributions of our REIT taxable income to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT under the Code. We may also repay or repurchase our existing indebtedness or equity from time to time. We typically fund our international expansion efforts primarily through a combination of cash on hand, intercompany debt and equity contributions. In July 2022, in connection with the funding of the CoreSite Acquisition, we entered into an agreement pursuant to which certain investment vehicles affiliated with Stonepeak acquired a noncontrolling ownership interest in our U.S. data center business. The transaction was completed in August 2022 for total aggregate consideration of $2.5 billion, through an investment in common equity and mandatorily convertible preferred equity. In October 2022, we entered into an agreement with Stonepeak for Stonepeak to acquire additional common equity and mandatorily preferred equity interests in our U.S. data center business for total aggregate consideration of $570.0 million. The transaction was completed in October 2022. We expect to pay distributions related to the outstanding common equity and mandatorily convertible preferred equity. As of December 31, 2022, we hold a common equity interest of approximately 72% in our U.S. data center business, with Stonepeak holding approximately 28% of the outstanding common equity and 100% of the outstanding mandatorily convertible 40 Table of Contents preferred equity. On a fully converted basis, which is expected to occur four years from the date of the initial closing in August 2022, and on the basis of the currently outstanding equity, we will hold a controlling ownership interest of approximately 64%, with Stonepeak holding approximately 36%. The mandatorily convertible preferred equity, which accrues dividends at 5.0%, will convert into common equity on a one for one basis, subject to adjustment that will be measured on the conversion date. As of December 31, 2022, we had total outstanding indebtedness of $38.9 billion, with a current portion of $4.5 billion. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we generated sufficient cash flow from operations, together with borrowings under our credit facilities, proceeds from our equity and debt issuances and cash on hand, to fund our acquisitions, capital expenditures and debt service obligations, as well as our required distributions. We believe the cash generated by operating activities during the year ending December 31, 2023, together with our borrowing capacity under our credit facilities, will be sufficient to fund our required distributions, capital expenditures, debt service obligations (interest and principal repayments) and signed acquisitions. As of December 31, 2022, we had $1.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2022, we had $244.6 million of cash and cash equivalents held by our joint ventures, of which $223.7 million was held by our foreign joint ventures. While certain subsidiaries may pay us interest or principal on intercompany debt, it has not been our practice to repatriate earnings from our foreign subsidiaries primarily due to our ongoing expansion efforts and related capital needs. However, in the event that we do repatriate any funds, we may be required to accrue and pay certain taxes. Cash Flows from Operating Activities For the year ended December 31, 2022, cash provided by operating activities decreased $1,123.7 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The primary factors that impacted cash provided by operating activities as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, include: • A decrease in unearned revenue due to advance payments from a customer during the year ended December 31, 2021; • An increase in cash required for working capital, primarily as a result of an increase in prepaid and other assets and a decrease in accounts payable; • An increase of approximately $297.4 million in cash paid for interest; and • An increase of approximately $97.1 million in cash paid for taxes. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Our significant investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2022 are highlighted below: • We spent approximately $549.0 million for acquisitions, including payments made for acquisitions completed in 2021. • We spent $1.9 billion for capital expenditures, as follows (in millions): Discretionary capital projects (1) $ 865.8 Ground lease purchases (2) 195.7 Capital improvements and corporate expenditures (3) 185.6 Redevelopment 398.2 Start-up capital projects 257.2 Total capital expenditures (4) $ 1,902.5 _______________ (1) Includes the construction of 6,890 communications sites globally and approximately $330 million of spend related to data center assets. (2) Includes $36.7 million of perpetual land easement payments reported in Deferred financing costs and other financing activities in the cash flows from financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows.

(4) Net of purchase credits of $14.5 million on certain assets, which are reported in investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. We plan to continue to allocate our available capital, after satisfying our distribution requirements, among investment alternatives that meet our return on investment criteria, while maintaining our commitment to our long-term financial policies. Accordingly, we expect to continue to deploy capital through our annual capital expenditure program, including land purchases and new site and data center facility construction, and through acquisitions. We also regularly review our portfolios as to capital 41 Table of Contents expenditures required to upgrade our infrastructure to our structural standards or address capacity, structural or permitting issues. We expect that our 2023 total capital expenditures will be as follows (in millions): Discretionary capital projects (1) $ 785 to $ 815 Ground lease purchases 85 to 105 Capital improvements and corporate expenditures 175 to 185 Redevelopment 485 to 515 Start-up capital projects 120 to 140 Total capital expenditures $ 1,650 to $ 1,760 _______________ (1) Includes the construction of approximately 3,450 to 4,550 communications sites globally and approximately $360 million of anticipated spend related to data center assets.

The net proceeds from this offering were approximately $1,282.6 million, after deducting commissions and estimated expenses. We used the net proceeds to repay existing indebtedness under the 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility, the 2021 Credit Facility and the 2021 USD 364-Day Delayed Draw Term Loan. The key terms of the Notes are as follows: Senior Notes Aggregate Principal Amount (in millions) Issue Date and Interest Accrual Date Maturity Date Contractual Interest Rate First Interest Payment Interest Payments Due (1) Par Call Date (2) 3.650% Notes $ 650.0 April 1, 2022 March 15, 2027 3.650 % September 15, 2022 March 15 and September 15 February 15, 2027 4.050% Notes $ 650.0 April 1, 2022 March 15, 2032 4.050 % September 15, 2022 March 15 and September 15 December 15, 2031 _______________ (1) Accrued and unpaid interest on U.S. Dollar (“USD”) denominated notes is payable in USD semi-annually in arrears and will be computed from the issue date on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. (2) We may redeem the Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes plus a make-whole premium, together with accrued interest to the redemption date. If we redeem the Notes on or after the par call date, we will not be required to pay a make-whole premium. If we undergo a change of control and corresponding ratings decline, each as defined in the supplemental indenture for the Notes, we may be required to repurchase all of the Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of such Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest (including additional interest, if any), up to but not including the repurchase date. The Notes rank equally with all of our other senior unsecured debt and are structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of our subsidiaries. The supplemental indenture contains certain covenants that restrict our ability to merge, consolidate or sell assets and our (together with our subsidiaries’) ability to incur liens. These covenants are subject to a number of exceptions, including that we and our subsidiaries may incur certain liens on assets, mortgages or other liens securing indebtedness if the aggregate amount of indebtedness secured by such liens does not exceed 3.5x Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the supplemental indenture. Repayment of CoreSite Debt— On January 7, 2022, we repaid the entire amount outstanding under the CoreSite Debt, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, January 7, 2022, for an aggregate redemption price of $962.9 million, including $80.1 million of prepayment consideration and $7.8 million in accrued and unpaid interest. The repayment of the CoreSite Debt was funded with borrowings under the 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility and cash on hand. Bank Facilities 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility— As of December 31, 2022, we had the ability to borrow up to $6.0 billion under our $6.0 billion senior unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facility, as amended and restated in December 2021 (the “2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility”), which includes a $3.5 billion sublimit for multicurrency borrowings, a $200.0 million sublimit for letters of credit and a $50.0 million sublimit for swingline loans. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we borrowed an aggregate of $850.0 million and repaid an aggregate of $1.4 billion of revolving indebtedness under the 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility. We used the borrowings to repay outstanding indebtedness, including the CoreSite Debt, and for general corporate purposes. 43 Table of Contents 2021 Credit Facility — As of December 31, 2022, we had the ability to borrow up to $4.0 billion under our $4.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, as amended and restated in December 2021 (the “2021 Credit Facility”), which includes a $2.5 billion sublimit for multicurrency borrowings, $200.0 million sublimit for letters of credit and a $50.0 million sublimit for swingline loans.

On August 11, 2022, we repaid all remaining amounts outstanding under the 2021 USD 364-Day Delayed Draw Term Loan using proceeds from the initial closing of the Stonepeak Transaction. As of December 31, 2022, the key terms under the 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility, the 2021 Credit Facility, our $1.0 billion unsecured term loan, as amended and restated in December 2021 (the “2021 Term Loan”), our 825.0 million EUR unsecured term loan, as amended in December 2021 (the “2021 EUR Three Year Delayed Draw Term Loan”) and our $1.5 billion unsecured term loan entered into in December 2021 (the “2021 USD Two Year Delayed Draw Term Loan”) were as follows: Bank Facility Outstanding Principal Balance Maturity Date LIBOR or EURIBOR borrowing interest rate range (1) Base rate borrowing interest rate range (1) Current margin over LIBOR or EURIBOR and the base rate, respectively 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility (2) $ 3,788.7 June 30, 2025 (3) 0.875% - 1.750% 0.000% - 0.750% 1.125% and 0.125% 2021 Credit Facility (4) 1,080.0 January 31, 2027 (3) 0.875% - 1.750% 0.000% - 0.750% 1.125% and 0.125% 2021 Term Loan (4) 1,000.0 January 31, 2027 0.875% - 1.750% 0.000% - 0.750% 1.125% and 0.125% 2021 EUR Three Year Delayed Draw Term Loan (5) 883.2 May 28, 2024 0.875% - 1.625% 0.000% - 0.625% 1.125% and 0.125% 2021 USD Two Year Delayed Draw Term Loan (4) 1,500.0 December 28, 2023 0.875% - 1.750% 0.000% - 0.750% 1.125% and 0.125% _______________ (1) Represents interest rate above LIBOR for LIBOR based borrowings, interest rate above Euro Interbank Offer Rate (“EURIBOR”) for EURIBOR based borrowings and interest rate above the defined base rate for base rate borrowings, in each case based on our debt ratings. (2) Currently borrowed at LIBOR for USD denominated borrowings and at EURIBOR for EUR denominated borrowings. (3) Subject to two optional renewal periods. (4) Currently borrowed at LIBOR. (5) Currently borrowed at EURIBOR. We must pay a quarterly commitment fee on the undrawn portion of each of the 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility and the 2021 Credit Facility. The commitment fee for the 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility and the 2021 Credit Facility ranges from 0.080% to 0.300% per annum, based upon our debt ratings, and is currently 0.110%. The 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility, the 2021 Credit Facility, the 2021 Term Loan, the 2021 EUR Three Year Delayed Draw Term Loan and the 2021 USD Two Year Delayed Draw Term Loan do not require amortization of principal and may be paid prior to maturity in whole or in part at our option without penalty or premium. We have the option of choosing either a defined base rate, LIBOR or EURIBOR as the applicable base rate for borrowings under these bank facilities. The loan agreements for each of the 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility, the 2021 Credit Facility, the 2021 Term Loan, the 2021 EUR Three Year Delayed Draw Term Loan and the 2021 USD Two Year Delayed Draw Term Loan contain certain reporting, information, financial and operating covenants and other restrictions (including limitations on additional debt, guaranties, sales of assets and liens) with which we must comply. Failure to comply with the financial and operating covenants of the loan agreements could not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under the revolving credit facilities, but may constitute a default, which could result in, among other things, the amounts outstanding under the applicable agreement, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable. Nigeria Letters of Credit —During the year ended December 31, 2022, we drew on letters of credit in Nigeria (the “Nigeria Letters of Credit”). The drawn amounts bear interest at a rate equal to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate at the time of drawing plus a spread. Amounts are due 270 days from the date of drawing. As of December 31, 2022, we had $16.2 million outstanding under the drawn Nigeria Letters of Credit. 44 Table of Contents India Indebtedness India Working Capital Facilities— The India indebtedness includes several working capital facilities, most of which are subject to annual renewal. The working capital facilities bear interest at rates that consist of the applicable bank’s Marginal Cost of Funds based Lending Rate or Market Benchmark (as defined in the applicable agreement), plus a spread. Generally, the working capital facilities are payable on demand prior to maturity. As of December 31, 2022, we have not borrowed under these facilities. Amounts outstanding and key terms of the India indebtedness consisted of the following as of December 31, 2022 (in millions, except percentages): Amount Outstanding (INR) Amount Outstanding (USD) Interest Rate (Range) Maturity Date (Range) Working capital facilities (1) — $ — 8.03% - 8.80% February 4, 2023 - October 22, 2023 _______________ (1) 7.9 billion INR ($95.6 million) of borrowing capacity as of December 31, 2022. We have 0.2 billion INR (approximately $2.6 million) of of bank guarantees outstanding included within the overall borrowing capacity. India Term Loan— On February 16, 2023, we entered into a 12.0 billion INR (approximately $145.1 million at the date of signing) unsecured term loan with a maturity date that is one year from the date of the first draw thereunder (the “India Term Loan”). On February 17, 2023, we borrowed 10.0 billion INR (approximately $120.7 million at the date of borrowing) under the India Term Loan. The India Term Loan bears interest at the three month treasury bill rate as announced by the Financial Benchmarks India Private Limited at the time of borrowing plus a margin of 1.95%. Any outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest will be due and payable in full at maturity. The India Term Loan does not require amortization of principal and may be paid prior to maturity in whole or in part at our option without penalty or premium. Stock Repurchase Programs — We have two stock repurchase programs, the 2011 Buyback and the 2017 Buyback. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we repurchased 90,042 shares of our common stock under the 2011 Buyback for an aggregate of $18.8 million, including commissions and fees. We had no repurchases under the 2017 Buyback. Under each program, we are authorized to purchase shares from time to time through open market purchases or in privately negotiated transactions not to exceed market prices and subject to market conditions and other factors. With respect to open market purchases, we may use plans adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act in accordance with securities laws and other legal requirements, which allows us to repurchase shares during periods when we may otherwise be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of self-imposed trading blackout periods. These programs may be discontinued at any time. We have repurchased a total of 14.5 million shares of our common stock under the 2011 Buyback for an aggregate of $1.5 billion, including commissions and fees. We expect to continue managing the pacing of the remaining approximately $2.0 billion under the Buyback Programs in response to general market conditions and other relevant factors. We expect to fund any further repurchases of our common stock through a combination of cash on hand, cash generated by operations and borrowings under our credit facilities. Repurchases under the Buyback Programs are subject to, among other things, us having available cash to fund the repurchases. Sales of Equity Securities —We receive proceeds from sales of our equity securities pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan (the “ESPP”) and upon exercise of stock options granted under our equity incentive plan, as amended (the “2007 Plan”). During the year ended December 31, 2022, we received an aggregate of $32.4 million in proceeds upon exercises of stock options and sales pursuant to the ESPP. 2020 “At the Market” Stock Offering Program —In August 2020, we established an “at the market” stock offering program through which we may issue and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $1.0 billion (the “2020 ATM Program”). Sales under the 2020 ATM Program may be made by means of ordinary brokers’ transactions on the New York Stock Exchange or otherwise at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to prevailing market prices or, subject to our specific instructions, at negotiated prices. We intend to use the net proceeds from any issuances under the 2020 ATM Program for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, the funding of acquisitions, additions to working capital and repayment or refinancing of existing indebtedness. As of December 31, 2022, we have not sold any shares of common stock under the 2020 ATM Program. 45 Table of Contents Common Stock Offering — On June 7, 2022, we completed a registered public offering of 9,185,000 shares of our common stock, par value $0.01 per share, (which includes the full exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option) at $256.00 per share. Aggregate net proceeds from this offering were approximately $2.3 billion after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses. We used the net proceeds to repay existing indebtedness under the 2021 USD 364-Day Delayed Draw Term Loan. Future Financing Transactions — We regularly consider various options to access the capital markets, subject to market conditions, to meet our funding needs. Such capital raising alternatives, in addition to those noted above including the 2020 ATM Program, may include additional senior note offerings and securitization transactions. No assurance can be given as to whether any such financing transactions will be completed or as to the timing or terms thereof. Distributions— As a REIT, we must annually distribute to our stockholders an amount equal to at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain). Generally, we have distributed, and expect to continue to distribute, all or substantially all of our REIT taxable income after taking into consideration our utilization of NOLs. We have distributed an aggregate of approximately $14.5 billion to our common stockholders, including the dividend paid in February 2023, primarily classified as ordinary income that may be treated as qualified REIT dividends under Section 199A of the Code for taxable years ending before 2026. The amount, timing and frequency of future distributions will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on various factors, a number of which may be beyond our control, including our financial condition and operating cash flows, the amount required to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT and reduce any income and excise taxes that we otherwise would be required to pay, limitations on distributions in our existing and future debt and preferred equity instruments, our ability to utilize NOLs to offset our distribution requirements, limitations on our ability to fund distributions using cash generated through our TRSs and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we paid $5.69 per share, or $2.6 billion, to common stockholders of record. In addition, we declared a distribution of $1.56 per share, or $726.3 million, paid on February 2, 2023 to our common stockholders of record at the close of business on December 28, 2022. We accrue distributions on unvested restricted stock units, which are payable upon vesting. The amount accrued for distributions payable related to unvested restricted stock units was $17.0 million and $12.8 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we paid $6.9 million of distributions upon the vesting of restricted stock units. For more details on the cash distributions paid to our common stockholders during the year ended December 31, 2022, see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. Material Cash Requirements — The following table summarizes material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations as of December 31, 2022 (in millions): 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 Thereafter Total Debt obligations (1) $ 4,514.2 $ 3,038.6 $ 7,501.3 $ 3,336.6 $ 5,969.2 $ 14,541.9 $ 38,901.8 Operating lease obligations (2) 1,165.6 1,064.6 1,007.4 947.9 886.6 6,319.8 11,391.9 ______________ (1) Includes aggregate principal maturities of long-term debt, including finance lease obligations (see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report). (2) Includes payments under non-cancellable initial terms, as well as payments for certain renewal periods at our option, which we expect to renew because failure to do so could result in a loss of the applicable communications sites and related revenues from tenant leases (see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report). Distributions— We expect that our 2023 total distributions declared to our common stockholders will be $3.0 billion. The amount, timing and frequency of future distributions will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors. Asset Retirement Obligations— We are required to remove our assets and remediate the leased sites upon which certain of our assets are located. As of December 31, 2022, the estimated undiscounted future cash outlay for asset retirement obligations was $4.2 billion. Factors Affecting Sources of Liquidity Our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities, borrow funds under our credit facilities and maintain compliance with the contractual agreements governing our indebtedness. We believe that the debt agreements discussed below represent our material debt agreements that contain covenants, our compliance with which would be material to an investor’s understanding of our financial results and the impact of those results on our liquidity. 46 Table of Contents Internally Generated Funds —Because the majority of our customer leases are multiyear contracts, a significant majority of the revenues generated by our property operations as of the end of 2022 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. Accordingly, a key factor affecting our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is to maintain this recurring revenue and to convert it into operating profit by minimizing operating costs and fully achieving our operating efficiencies. In addition, our ability to increase cash flow from operating activities depends upon the demand for our communications infrastructure and our related services and our ability to increase the utilization of our existing communications infrastructure. Restrictions Under Loan Agreements Relating to Our Credit Facilities —The loan agreements for the 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility, the 2021 Credit Facility, the 2021 Term Loan, the 2021 EUR Three Year Delayed Draw Term Loan and the 2021 USD Two Year Delayed Draw Term Loan contain certain financial and operating covenants and other restrictions applicable to us and our subsidiaries that are not designated as unrestricted subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. These restrictions include limitations on additional debt, distributions and dividends, guaranties, sales of assets and liens. The loan agreements also contain covenants that establish financial tests with which we and our restricted subsidiaries must comply related to total leverage and senior secured leverage, as set forth in the table below. As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with each of these covenants. Compliance Tests For The 12 Months Ended December 31, 2022 ($ in billions) Ratio (1) Additional Debt Capacity Under Covenants (2) Capacity for Adjusted EBITDA Decrease Under Covenants (3) Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ≤ 7.50:1.00 ~11.5 ~1.5 Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio Senior Secured Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ≤ 3.00:1.00 ~17.7 (4) ~5.9 _______________ (1) Each component of the ratio as defined in the applicable loan agreement. (2) Assumes no change to Adjusted EBITDA. (3) Assumes no change to our debt levels. (4) Effectively, however, additional Senior Secured Debt under this ratio would be limited to the capacity under the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio. Under the terms of the agreements for the 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility, the 2021 Credit Facility, the 2021 Term Loan, the 2021 EUR Three Year Delayed Draw Term Loan and the 2021 USD Two Year Delayed Draw Term Loan, the Telxius Acquisition and the CoreSite Acquisition were designated as a Qualified Acquisitions, whereby our Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio was adjusted to not exceed 7.50 to 1.00 for four full fiscal quarters following consummation of such acquisitions, which lasted until the quarter ended December 31, 2022. Subsequent to December 31, 2022, our Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio stepped back down to not exceed 6.00 to 1.00. The loan agreements for our credit facilities also contain reporting and information covenants that require us to provide financial and operating information to the lenders within certain time periods. If we are unable to provide the required information on a timely basis, we would be in breach of these covenants. Failure to comply with the financial maintenance tests and certain other covenants of the loan agreements for our credit facilities could not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under these credit facilities, but may also constitute a default under these credit facilities, which could result in, among other things, the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable. If this were to occur, we may not have sufficient cash on hand to repay such indebtedness. The key factors affecting our ability to comply with the debt covenants described above are our financial performance relative to the financial maintenance tests defined in the loan agreements for these credit facilities and our ability to fund our debt service obligations. Based upon our current expectations, we believe our operating results during the next 12 months will be sufficient to comply with these covenants. Restrictions Under Agreements Relating to the 2015 Securitization and the Trust Securitizations— The indenture and related supplemental indenture governing the American Tower Secured Revenue Notes, Series 2015-2, Class A (the “Series 2015-2 Notes”) issued by GTP Acquisition Partners I, LLC (“GTP Acquisition Partners”) in the 2015 Securitization and the loan agreement related to the Trust Securitizations include certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions customary for transactions subject to rated securitizations. Among other things, GTP Acquisition Partners and American Tower Asset Sub, LLC and American Tower Asset Sub II, LLC (together, the “AMT Asset Subs”) are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets, subject to customary carve-outs for ordinary course trade payables and permitted encumbrances (as defined in the applicable agreements). Under the agreements, amounts due will be paid from the cash flows generated by the assets securing the Series 2015-2 Notes or the assets securing the nonrecourse loan that secures the Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2013-2A (the “Series 2013-2A Securities”), Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2018-1, Subclass A (the “Series 2018-1A Securities”), and the 47 Table of Contents Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2018-1, Subclass R (the “Series 2018-1R Securities” and, together with the Series 2018-1A Securities, the “2018 Securities”) issued in the Trust Securitizations (the “Loan”), as applicable, which must be deposited into certain reserve accounts, and thereafter distributed, solely pursuant to the terms of the applicable agreement. On a monthly basis, after payment of all required amounts under the applicable agreement, subject to the conditions described in the table below, the excess cash flows generated from the operation of such assets are released to GTP Acquisition Partners or the AMT Asset Subs, as applicable, which can then be distributed to, and used by, us. As of December 31, 2022, $78.4 million held in such reserve accounts was classified as restricted cash. Certain information with respect to the 2015 Securitization and the Trust Securitizations is set forth below. The debt service coverage ratio (“DSCR”) is generally calculated as the ratio of the net cash flow (as defined in the applicable agreement) to the amount of interest, servicing fees and trustee fees required to be paid over the succeeding 12 months on the principal amount of the Series 2015-2 Notes or the Loan, as applicable, that will be outstanding on the payment date following such date of determination. Issuer or Borrower Notes/Securities Issued Conditions Limiting Distributions of Excess Cash Excess Cash Distributed During Year Ended December 31, 2022 DSCR as of December 31, 2022 Capacity for Decrease in Net Cash Flow Before Triggering Cash Trap DSCR (1) Capacity for Decrease in Net Cash Flow Before Triggering Minimum DSCR (1) Cash Trap DSCR Amortization Period (in millions) (in millions) (in millions) 2015 Securitization GTP Acquisition Partners American Tower Secured Revenue Notes, Series 2015-2 1.30x, Tested Quarterly (2) (3)(4) $387.1 16.53x $280.2 $283.0 Trust Securitizations AMT Asset Subs Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2013-2A, Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2018-1, Subclass A and Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2018-1, Subclass R 1.30x, Tested Quarterly (2) (3)(5) $598.1 10.20x $531.7 $540.7 _______________ (1) Based on the net cash flow of the applicable issuer or borrower as of December 31, 2022 and the expenses payable over the next 12 months on the Series 2015-2 Notes or the Loan, as applicable. (2) Once triggered, a Cash Trap DSCR condition continues to exist until the DSCR exceeds the Cash Trap DSCR for two consecutive calendar quarters. During a Cash Trap DSCR condition, all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments, fund required reserves, pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and make other payments required under the applicable transaction documents, referred to as excess cash flow, will be deposited into a reserve account (the “Cash Trap Reserve Account”) instead of being released to the applicable issuer or borrower. (3) An amortization period commences if the DSCR is equal to or below 1.15x (the “Minimum DSCR”) at the end of any calendar quarter and continues to exist until the DSCR exceeds the Minimum DSCR for two consecutive calendar quarters. (4) No amortization period is triggered if the outstanding principal amount of a series has not been repaid in full on the applicable anticipated repayment date. However, in such event, additional interest will accrue on the unpaid principal balance of the applicable series, and such series will begin to amortize on a monthly basis from excess cash flow. (5) An amortization period exists if the outstanding principal amount has not been paid in full on the applicable anticipated repayment date and continues to exist until such principal has been repaid in full. A failure to meet the noted DSCR tests could prevent GTP Acquisition Partners or the AMT Asset Subs from distributing excess cash flow to us, which could affect our ability to fund our capital expenditures, including tower construction and acquisitions and to meet REIT distribution requirements. During an “amortization period,” all excess cash flow and any amounts then in the applicable Cash Trap Reserve Account would be applied to pay the principal of the Series 2015-2 Notes or the Loan, as applicable, on each monthly payment date, and so would not be available for distribution to us. Further, additional interest will begin to accrue with respect to the Series 2015-2 Notes or subclass of the Loan from and after the anticipated repayment date at a per annum rate determined in accordance with the applicable agreement. With respect to the Series 2015-2 Notes, upon the occurrence of, and during, an event of default, the applicable trustee may, in its discretion or at the direction of holders of more than 50% of the aggregate outstanding principal of the Series 2015-2 Notes, declare the Series 2015-2 Notes immediately due and payable, in which case any excess cash flow would need to be used to pay holders of such notes. 48 Table of Contents Furthermore, if GTP Acquisition Partners or the AMT Asset Subs were to default on the Series 2015-2 Notes or the Loan, the applicable trustee may seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of all or any portion of the 3,516 communications sites that secure the Series 2015-2 Notes or the 5,102 broadcast and wireless communications towers and related assets that secure the Loan, respectively, in which case we could lose such sites and the revenue associated with those assets. As discussed above, we use our available liquidity and seek new sources of liquidity to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, satisfy our distribution requirements and repay or repurchase our debt. If we determine that it is desirable or necessary to raise additional capital, we may be unable to do so, or such additional financing may be prohibitively expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness. Further, as further discussed under Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption “Risk Factors,” extreme market volatility and disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may impact our ability to raise additional capital through debt financing activities or our ability to repay or refinance maturing liabilities, or impact the terms of any new obligations. If we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise, we may not be able to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, satisfy our REIT distribution requirements and debt service obligations or refinance our existing indebtedness. In addition, our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities. As set forth under Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption “Risk Factors,” we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and, consequently, a failure by a significant customer to perform its contractual obligations to us could adversely affect our cash flow and liquidity. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We have reviewed our policies and estimates to determine our critical accounting policies for the year ended December 31, 2022. We have identified the following policies as critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition. This is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies. See note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for a summary of our significant accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP, with no need for management’s judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result. • Impairment of Assets—Assets Subject to Depreciation and Amortization : We review long-lived assets for impairment at least annually or whenever events, changes in circumstances or other indicators or evidence indicate that the carrying amount of our assets may not be recoverable. We review our tower portfolio, network location intangible and right-of-use assets for indicators of impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, typically at an individual tower basis. Possible indicators include a tower not having current tenant leases or having expenses in excess of revenues. A cash flow modeling approach is utilized to assess recoverability and incorporates, among other items, the tower location, the tower location demographics, the timing of additions of new tenants, lease rates and estimated length of tenancy and ongoing cash requirements. We review our tenant-related intangible assets on a tenant by tenant basis for indicators of impairment, such as high levels of turnover or attrition, non-renewal of a significant number of contracts or the cancellation or termination of a relationship. We assess recoverability by determining whether the carrying amount of the tenant-related intangible assets will be recovered primarily through projected undiscounted future cash flows. If the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of our long-lived assets is less than the carrying amount of the assets, an impairment loss may be recognized. Key assumptions included in the undiscounted cash flows are future revenue projections, estimates of ongoing tenancies and operating margins. An impairment loss would be based on the fair value of the asset, which is based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows to be provided from the asset. We record any related impairment charge in the period in which we identify such impairment. In October 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued a ruling regarding the definition of AGR and associated fees and charges, which was reaffirmed in March 2020, and again in July 2021 with respect to the total charges, that may have a material financial impact on certain of our customers and could affect their ability to perform their obligations under 49 Table of Contents agreements with us. In September 2020, the Supreme Court of India defined the expected timeline of ten years for payments owed under the ruling. In September 2021, the government of India approved a relief package that, among other things, included (i) a four year moratorium on the payment of AGR fees owed and (ii) a change in the definition of AGR on a prospective basis. In the third quarter of 2022, our largest customer in India, VIL, communicated that it would make partial payments of its contractual amounts owed to us and indicated that it would continue to make partial payments for the remainder of 2022. In late 2022, VIL had communicated its intent to resume payments in full under its contractual obligations owed to us beginning on January 1, 2023. However, in early 2023, VIL communicated that it would not be able to resume payments in full of its contractual obligations owed to us, and that it would instead continue to make partial payments. As a result, we determined that certain fixed and intangible assets had been impaired during the year ended December 31, 2022. An impairment of $97.0 million was taken on tower and network location intangible assets in India. We also impaired the tenant-related intangible assets for VIL, which resulted in an impairment of $411.6 million. We will continue to monitor the status of these developments, as it is possible that the estimated future cash flows may differ from current estimates and changes in estimated cash flows from customers in India could have further negative effects on previously recorded tangible and intangible assets, including amounts originally recorded as tenant-related intangible assets, resulting in additional impairments. The carrying value of tenant-related intangible assets in India was $379.5 million as of December 31, 2022, which represents 3% of our consolidated balance of $13.1 billion. Additionally, a significant reduction in customer-related cash flows in India could also impact our tower portfolio and network location intangible assets. The carrying values of our tower portfolio and network location intangible assets in India were $905.8 million and $266.7 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2022, which represent 10% and 8% of our consolidated balances of $8.8 billion and $3.5 billion, respectively. • Impairment of Assets—Goodwill: We review goodwill for impairment at least annually (as of December 31) or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill is recorded in the applicable segment and assessed for impairment at the reporting unit level. We employ a discounted cash flow analysis when testing goodwill. The key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance, terminal revenue growth rate, management’s expectations of future operating results and cash requirements, the current weighted average cost of capital and an expected tax rate. We compare the fair value of the reporting unit, as calculated under an income approach using future discounted cash flows, to the carrying amount of the applicable reporting unit. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount of the excess. The loss recognized is limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. During the year ended December 31, 2022, no potential goodwill impairment was identified as the fair value of each of our reporting units was in excess of its carrying amount. The fair value of our India reporting unit, which is based on the present value of forecasted future value cash flows (the income approach), exceeded the carrying value by approximately 24%. Key assumptions include future revenue growth rates and operating margins, capital expenditures, terminal period growth rate and the weighted-average cost of capital, which were determined considering historical data and current assumptions, including uncertainty with respect to amounts owed from VIL (discussed above). For this reporting unit, we performed a sensitivity analysis on our significant assumptions and determined that a (i) 5% reduction of projected revenues, (ii) 229 basis point increase in the weighted-average cost of capital or (iii) 200% reduction in terminal revenue growth rate, individually, each of which we determined to be reasonable, would impact our conclusion that the fair value of the India reporting unit exceeds its carrying value. Events that could negatively affect our India reporting unit’s financial results include increased tenant attrition exceeding our forecast, additional VIL payment shortfalls, carrier tenant bankruptcies and other factors set forth in Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption “Risk Factors.” • Acquisitions : We evaluate each of our acquisitions under the accounting guidance framework to determine whether to treat an acquisition as an asset acquisition or a business combination. For those transactions treated as asset acquisitions, the purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired, with no recognition of goodwill. For those acquisitions that meet the definition of a business combination, we apply the acquisition method of accounting where assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value at the date of each acquisition, and the results of operations are included with our results from the dates of the respective acquisitions. Any excess of the purchase price paid over the amounts recognized for assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. We continue to evaluate acquisitions accounted for as business combinations for a period not to exceed one year after the applicable acquisition date of each transaction to determine whether any additional adjustments are needed to the allocation of the purchase price paid for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is typically determined by using either estimates of replacement costs or discounted cash flow valuation methods. When determining the fair value of tangible assets acquired, we must estimate the cost to replace the asset 50 Table of Contents with a new asset taking into consideration such factors as age, condition and the economic useful life of the asset. When determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired, we must estimate the applicable discount rate and the timing and amount of future tenant cash flows, including rate and terms of renewal and attrition. • Revenue Recognition: Our revenue is derived from leasing the right to use our communications sites, the land on which the sites are located and our data center facilities (the “lease component”) and from the reimbursement of costs incurred in operating the communications sites and supporting the tenants’ equipment as well as other services and contractual rights (the “non-lease component”). Most of our revenue is derived from leasing arrangements and is accounted for as lease revenue unless the timing and pattern of revenue recognition of the non-lease component differs from the lease component. If the timing and pattern of the non-lease component revenue recognition differs from that of the lease component, we separately determine the stand-alone selling prices and pattern of revenue recognition for each performance obligation. Our revenue from leasing arrangements, including fixed escalation clauses present in non-cancellable lease arrangements, is reported on a straight-line basis over the term of the respective leases when collectibility is probable. Escalation clauses tied to a consumer price index or other inflation-based indices, and other incentives present in lease agreements with our tenants, are excluded from the straight-line calculation. Total property straight-line revenues for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were $499.8 million, $465.6 million and $322.0 million, respectively. Amounts billed upfront in connection with the execution of lease agreements are initially deferred and reflected in Unearned revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and recognized as revenue over the terms of the applicable lease arrangements. Amounts billed or received for services prior to being earned are deferred and reflected in Unearned revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets until the criteria for recognition have been met. We derive the largest portion of our revenues, corresponding trade receivables and the related deferred rent asset from a small number of tenants in the telecommunications industry, with 46% of our revenues derived from three tenants. In addition, we have concentrations of credit risk in certain geographic areas. We mitigate the concentrations of credit risk with respect to notes and trade receivables by actively monitoring the creditworthiness of our borrowers and tenants. In recognizing tenant revenue we assess the collectibility of both the amounts billed and the portion recognized on a straight-line basis. This assessment takes tenant credit risk and business and industry conditions into consideration to ultimately determine the collectibility of the amounts billed. To the extent the amounts, based on management’s estimates, may not be collectible, recognition is deferred until such point as the uncertainty is resolved. Any amounts that were previously recognized as revenue and are subsequently determined to present a risk of collection are reserved as bad debt expense. Accounts receivable are reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts related to estimated losses resulting from a tenant’s inability to make required payments and allowances for amounts invoiced whose collectibility is not reasonably assured. • Rent Expense and Lease Accounting: Many of the leases underlying our tower sites and data centers have fixed rent escalations, which provide for periodic increases in the amount of ground rent payable over time. In addition, certain of our tenant leases require us to exercise available renewal options pursuant to the underlying ground lease if the tenant exercises its renewal option. Our calculation of the lease liability includes the term of the underlying ground lease plus all periods, if any, for which failure to renew the lease imposes an economic penalty to us such that renewal appears to be reasonably assured. We recognize a right-of-use lease asset and lease liability for operating and finance leases. The right-of-use asset is measured as the sum of the lease liability, prepaid or accrued lease payments, any initial direct costs incurred and any other applicable amounts. The calculation of the lease liability requires us to make certain assumptions for each lease, including lease term and discount rate implicit in each lease, which could significantly impact the gross lease obligation, the duration and the present value of the lease liability. When calculating the lease term, we consider the renewal, cancellation and termination rights available to us and the lessor. We determine the discount rate by calculating the incremental borrowing rate on a collateralized basis at the commencement of a lease or upon a change in the lease term. • Income Taxes: Accounting for income taxes requires us to estimate the timing and impact of amounts recorded in our financial statements that may be recognized differently for tax purposes. To the extent that the timing of amounts recognized for financial reporting purposes differs from the timing of recognition for tax reporting purposes, deferred tax assets or liabilities are required to be recorded. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of a change in tax rates is 51 Table of Contents recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. We do not expect to pay federal income taxes on our REIT taxable income. We periodically review our deferred tax assets, and we record a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets. Valuation allowances would be reversed as a reduction to the provision for income taxes, if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based on changes in facts and circumstances relevant to the assets’ recoverability. We recognize the benefit of uncertain tax positions when, in management’s judgment, it is more likely than not that positions we have taken in our tax returns will be sustained upon examination, which are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. We adjust our tax liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information or information not previously available. Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which additional information is available or the position is ultimately settled under audit.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The following table provides information as of December 31, 2022 about our market risk exposure associated with changing interest rates. For long-term debt obligations, the table presents principal cash flows by maturity date and average interest rates related to outstanding obligations. For interest rate swaps, the table presents notional principal amounts and weighted-average interest rates (in millions, except percentages). For more information, see Item 7 of this Annual Report under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources” and note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.

(b) Variable rate debt consisted of: the 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility, which matures on June 30, 2025; the 2021 Credit Facility, which matures on January 31, 2027; the 2021 Term Loan, which matures on January 31, 2027; the 2021 EUR Three Year Delayed Draw Term Loan, which matures on May 28, 2024; the 2021 USD Two Year Delayed Draw Term Loan, which matures on December 28, 2023; the 3.000% Notes; and other debt including the Nigeria Letters of Credit. (c) Based on rates effective as of December 31, 2022. (d) As of December 31, 2022, the interest rate swap agreements in the United States were included in Accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheet. (e) Represents the weighted average variable rate of interest based on contractual notional amount as a percentage of total notional amounts. Interest Rate Risk As of December 31, 2022, we had three interest rate swap agreements related to a portion of our 3.000% senior unsecured notes due 2023 (the “3.000% Notes”). These swaps have been designated as fair value hedges, have an aggregate notional amount of $500.0 million, have an interest rate of one-month LIBOR plus applicable spreads and expire in June 2023. Changes in interest rates can cause interest charges to fluctuate on our variable rate debt. Variable rate debt as of December 31, 2022 consisted of $3.8 billion under the 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility, $1.1 billion under the 2021 Credit Facility, $1.0 52 Table of Contents billion under the 2021 Term Loan, $883.2 million under the 2021 EUR Three Year Delayed Draw Term Loan, $1.5 billion under the 2021 USD Two Year Delayed Draw Term Loan, $500.0 million under the interest rate swap agreements related to the 3.000% Notes and $16.2 million under the Nigeria Letters of Credit. A 10% increase in current interest rates would result in an additional $42.4 million of interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2022. Foreign Currency Risk We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily in connection with our foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures internationally. Any transaction denominated in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar is reported in U.S. Dollars at the applicable exchange rate. All assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. Dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of the applicable fiscal reporting period and all revenues and expenses are translated at average rates for the period. The cumulative translation effect is included in equity as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We may enter into additional foreign currency financial instruments in anticipation of future transactions to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. For the year ended December 31, 2022, 43% of our revenues and 52% of our total operating expenses were denominated in foreign currencies. As of December 31, 2022, we have incurred intercompany debt that is not considered to be permanently reinvested, and similar unaffiliated balances that were denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the subsidiary in which it is recorded. As this debt had not been designated as being a long-term investment in nature, any changes in the foreign currency exchange rates will result in unrealized gains or losses, which will be included in our determination of net income. An adverse change of 10% in the underlying exchange rates of our unsettled intercompany debt and similar unaffiliated balances would result in $40.5 million of unrealized losses that would be included in Other expense in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, we have 7.3 billion EUR (approximately $7.8 billion) denominated debt outstanding. An adverse change of 10% in the underlying exchange rates of our outstanding EUR debt would result in $0.9 billion of foreign currency losses that would be included in Other expense in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures We have established disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that material information relating to us, including our consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to the officers who certify our financial reports and to other members of senior management and the Board of Directors. Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2022 and designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the requisite time periods specified in the applicable rules and forms, and that it is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 53 Table of Contents Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making its assessment of internal control over financial reporting, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) . Based on this assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, our internal control over financial reporting is effective. Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm that audited our financial statements included in this Annual Report, has issued an attestation report on management’s internal control over financial reporting, which is included in this Item 9A under the caption “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm.” Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 54 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of American Tower Corporation Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of American Tower Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, of the Company and our report dated February 23, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP Boston, Massachusetts February 23, 2023 ITEM 9B.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 23, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Revenue Recognition for Significant Contract Modifications - Refer to Notes 1 and 4 to the financial statements. Critical Audit Matter Description The Company’s contracts with major tenants are often governed by a master lease agreement that contains terms and provisions governing the tenant’s right to use the Company’s telecommunications sites and the land on which the sites are located (the “lease component”) and the tenant’s responsibility for reimbursement of various costs incurred by the Company in operating the telecommunications towers and supporting the tenant’s equipment as well as other services and contractual rights (the “non-lease components”). The master lease agreements contain both lease and non-lease components, may contain unusual or non-standard terms, and often pertain to many of the Company’s telecommunications sites. In the current year, the Company amended a master lease agreement with a major tenant. Management of the Company exercised significant judgment in determining the appropriate revenue recognition for the amended master lease agreement, including the following: • Determination of the lease and non-lease components and whether they should be accounted for as a combined lease component or separately. F-2 Table of Contents • Determination of the stand-alone selling prices for each performance obligation in the master lease agreement if not accounted for with the lease component. • Determination of the fixed and variable consideration in the master lease agreement, the impact of cancellation and renewal provisions, the estimated term of each of the individual contracts impacted by the master lease agreement, and the pattern of recognition for each lease component or performance obligation. We identified the amended master lease agreement with a major tenant as a critical audit matter because the audit effort required to evaluate the Company’s judgments in determining the appropriate revenue recognition for the impact of a multi-faceted, complex master lease agreement entered into with the major tenant was extensive. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our principal audit procedures related to the Company’s amended master lease agreement with the major customer included the following: • We tested the effectiveness of internal controls related to the Company’s process for evaluating the proper accounting for the master lease agreement. • We evaluated the Company’s significant accounting policies related to the master lease agreement for reasonableness and compliance with the applicable accounting standards. • We evaluated the master lease agreement and performed the following procedures: ◦ Obtained and evaluated the documents that were part of the overall master lease agreement. ◦ Tested the Company’s identification of the significant terms for completeness and accuracy, including the identification of the lease and non-lease components, cancellation and renewal provisions, estimated term and fixed and variable consideration. ◦ Tested the completeness and accuracy of leases subject to the master lease agreement. ◦ Assessed the terms and provisions in the master lease agreement and evaluated the appropriateness of the Company’s application of their accounting policies, along with their use of estimates, in the determination of revenue recognition conclusions. • We tested the mathematical accuracy of the Company’s determination of revenue and the associated timing of revenue recognized in the financial statements. Recoverability of goodwill and long-lived assets – India Reporting Unit - Refer to Notes 1, 3, 5, 16, and 22 to the financial statements. Critical Audit Matter Description The Company reviews goodwill for impairment at least annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Additionally, the Company reviews other long-lived assets to be held and used and which are subject to depreciation or amortization, such as property and equipment, tenant-related intangible assets, network location intangible assets, and right-of-use assets on operating leases for impairment whenever events, changes in circumstances or other evidence indicate that the carrying amount of the Company’s assets may not be recoverable. The Company's evaluation of recovery of goodwill involves the comparison of the carrying amount of a reporting unit inclusive of allocated goodwill to the fair value of the applicable reporting unit. The Company’s evaluation of the recovery of long-lived assets, involves a comparison of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset to the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If these assets are determined to be impaired, the amount of impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their fair value. Fair value is generally determined using forecasted cash flows discounted using an estimated weighted average cost of capital. As of December 31, 2022, the India reporting unit had goodwill of approximately $881.6 million. As the fair value of the India reporting unit exceeded its’ carrying amount as of December 31, 2022, the Company determined that its related goodwill was not impaired. Other long-lived assets to be held and used in India at December 31, 2022 consisted of property and equipment, tenant-related intangible assets, network location intangible assets, and right of use assets of approximately $924.4 million, $379.5 million, $266.7 million and $668.9 million, respectively, after impairments were recorded during the year then ended of $58.6 million, $411.6 million, $38.4 million and $0.0 million, respectively. F-3 Table of Contents We identified the evaluation of the recovery of goodwill and long-lived assets held in the Company’s India reporting unit, along with any related impairments, as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to estimate the timing and amount of cash flows and related estimated fair values used in the impairment analyses. There was a high degree of auditor judgment in evaluating management's assumptions and estimates related to future tenant retention rates (specifically, a high degree of subjective auditor judgment was required to evaluate future revenues related to variability in receipts from a significant tenant in India), revenue growth rates, margin projections, the timing of future cash flows, the discount rate used and the determination of market multiples for the India reporting unit and related long-lived assets. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our audit procedures related to the assumptions and estimates of future tenant retention rates, revenue growth rates, and margin projections used to estimate the timing and extent of future cash flows, and the discount rate and the determination of market multiples used by management to estimate fair value, included the following, among others: • We tested the effectiveness of internal controls over management’s goodwill impairment evaluation, including those over the determination of the fair value of the India reporting unit. • We tested the effectiveness of internal controls over management’s long-lived asset impairment evaluation. • We evaluated management’s ability to forecast future tenant retention rates, revenue growth rates, margin projections and timing of future cash flows by comparing actual results to management’s historical forecasts. • We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s use of tenant retention rates, growth rates, margin projections and timing of future cash flows by comparing the forecasts to: ◦ Historical results. ◦ Internal communications to management and the Board of Directors. ◦ Forecasted information included in analyst and industry reports for the Company and certain of its peer companies. /s/ Deloitte & Touche Boston, Massachusetts February 23, 2023 We have served as the Company’s auditor since 1997.

F-9 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) 1. BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Business —American Tower Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, “ATC” or the “Company”) is one of the largest global real estate investment trusts and a leading independent owner, operator and developer of multitenant communications real estate. The Company’s primary business is the leasing of space on communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, wireless data providers, government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries. The Company refers to this business as its property operations. Additionally, the Company offers tower-related services in the United States, which the Company refers to as its services operations. These services include site application, zoning and permitting (“AZP”), structural analysis and construction management, which primarily support the Company’s site leasing business, including the addition of new tenants and equipment on its sites. The Company’s customers include its tenants, licensees and other payers. The Company’s portfolio primarily consists of towers that it owns and towers that it operates pursuant to long-term lease arrangements, as well as distributed antenna system (“DAS”) networks, which provide seamless coverage solutions in certain in-building and outdoor wireless environments. In addition to the communications sites in its portfolio, the Company manages rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements. The Company also holds other telecommunications infrastructure, fiber and property interests that it leases primarily to communications service providers and third-party tower operators and holds a portfolio of highly interconnected data center facilities and related assets in the United States that the Company leases primarily to enterprises, network operators, cloud providers and supporting service providers. American Tower Corporation is a holding company that conducts its operations through its directly and indirectly owned subsidiaries and joint ventures. ATC’s principal domestic operating subsidiaries are American Towers LLC and SpectraSite Communications, LLC. ATC conducts its international operations primarily through its subsidiary, American Tower International, Inc., which in turn conducts operations through its various international holding and operating subsidiaries and joint ventures. The Company operates as a real estate investment trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes (“REIT”). Accordingly, the Company generally is not required to pay U.S. federal income taxes on income generated by its REIT operations, including the income derived from leasing space on its towers and in its data centers, as it receives a dividends paid deduction for distributions to stockholders that generally offsets its REIT income and gains. However, the Company remains obligated to pay U.S. federal income taxes on earnings from its domestic taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRSs”). In addition, the Company’s international assets and operations, regardless of their classification for U.S. tax purposes, continue to be subject to taxation in the jurisdictions where those assets are held or those operations are conducted. The use of TRSs enables the Company to continue to engage in certain businesses and jurisdictions while complying with REIT qualification requirements. The Company may, from time to time, change the election of previously designated TRSs to be included as part of the REIT. As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s REIT-qualified businesses included its U.S. tower leasing business, a majority of its U.S. indoor DAS networks business, its Services and Data Centers segments, as well as most of its operations in Canada, Costa Rica, France, Germany, Ghana, Kenya, Mexico, Nigeria, South Africa and Uganda. Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation —The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and those entities in which it has a controlling interest. Investments in entities that the Company does not control are accounted for using the equity method or as investments in equity securities, depending upon the Company’s ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. As of December 31, 2022, the Company holds (i) a 52 % controlling interest in subsidiaries whose holdings consist of the Company’s operations in France, Germany, Poland and Spain (such subsidiaries collectively, “ATC Europe”) (Allianz and CDPQ (each as defined in note 15) hold the noncontrolling interests), (ii) a 51 % controlling interest in a joint venture whose holdings consist of the Company’s operations in Bangladesh (Confidence Tower Holdings Ltd. (“Confidence Group”) holds the noncontrolling interest) and (iii) a common equity interest of approximately 72 % in the Company’s U.S. data center business (Stonepeak (as defined and further discussed in note 15) holds approximately 28 % of the outstanding common equity and 100 % of the outstanding mandatorily convertible preferred equity). As of December 31, 2022, ATC Europe holds an 87 % and an 83 % controlling interest in subsidiaries that consist of the Company’s operations in Germany and Spain, respectively (PGGM holds the noncontrolling interests). See note 15 for a discussion of changes to the Company’s noncontrolling interests during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. F-10 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) Reportable Segments —The Company reports its results in seven segments – U.S. & Canada property (which includes all assets in the United States and Canada, other than the Company’s data center facilities and related assets), Asia-Pacific property, Africa property, Europe property, Latin America property, Data Centers and Services, which are discussed further in note 20. Significant Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates —The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results may differ from those estimates, and such differences could be material to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The significant estimates in the accompanying consolidated financial statements include impairment of long-lived assets (including goodwill), revenue recognition, rent expense and lease accounting, income taxes and accounting for business combinations and acquisitions of assets. The Company considers events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued as additional evidence for certain estimates or to identify matters that require additional disclosure. Accounts Receivable and Deferred Rent Asset —The Company derives the largest portion of its revenues and corresponding accounts receivable and the related deferred rent asset from a relatively small number of customers in the telecommunications industry, and 46 % of its current-year revenues are derived from three customers. The Company’s deferred rent asset is associated with non-cancellable tenant leases that contain fixed escalation clauses over the terms of the applicable lease in which revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company mitigates its concentrations of credit risk with respect to notes and trade receivables and the related deferred rent assets by actively monitoring the creditworthiness of its borrowers and customers. In recognizing customer revenue, the Company assesses the collectibility of both the amounts billed and the portion recognized in advance of billing on a straight-line basis. This assessment takes customer credit risk and business and industry conditions into consideration to ultimately determine the collectibility of the amounts billed. To the extent the amounts, based on management’s estimates, may not be collectible, revenue recognition is deferred until such point as collectibility is determined to be reasonably assured. Any amounts that were previously recognized as revenue and are subsequently determined to present a risk of collection are reserved as bad debt expense included in Selling, general, administrative and development expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Accounts receivable is reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts related to estimated losses resulting from a customer’s inability to make required payments and allowances for amounts invoiced whose collectibility is not reasonably assured. These allowances are generally estimated based on payment patterns, days past due and collection history, and incorporate changes in economic conditions that may not be reflected in historical trends, such as customers in bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization. Receivables are written-off against the allowances or reserves when they are determined to be uncollectible. Such determination includes analysis and consideration of the particular conditions of the account. Changes in the allowances were as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Balance as of January 1, $ 355.9 $ 247.6 $ 163.3 Current year increases 168.2 130.9 105.6 Write-offs, recoveries and other ( 85.4 ) ( 22.6 ) ( 21.3 ) Balance as of December 31, $ 438.7 $ 355.9 $ 247.6 Functional Currency —The functional currency of each of the Company’s foreign operating subsidiaries is normally the respective local currency, except for Costa Rica and Argentina, where the functional currency is the U.S. Dollar. All foreign currency assets and liabilities held by the subsidiaries are translated into U.S. Dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the end of the applicable fiscal reporting period and all foreign currency revenues and expenses are translated at the average monthly exchange rates. Translation adjustments are reflected in equity as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss (“AOCL”) in the consolidated balance sheets and included as a component of Comprehensive income in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Gains and losses on foreign currency transactions are reflected in Other expense in the consolidated statements of operations. However, the effect from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on intercompany debt for which repayment is not F-11 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) anticipated in the foreseeable future is reflected in AOCL in the consolidated balance sheets and included as a component of Comprehensive income. The Company recorded the following net foreign currency (gains) losses: Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Foreign currency losses recorded in AOCL $ 336.7 $ 466.5 $ 391.0 Foreign currency (gains) losses recorded in Other expense ( 449.4 ) ( 557.9 ) 216.4 Total foreign currency (gains) losses $ ( 112.7 ) $ ( 91.4 ) $ 607.4 Cash and Cash Equivalents —Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, demand deposits and short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less. The Company maintains its deposits at high-quality financial institutions and monitors the credit ratings of those institutions. Restricted Cash— Restricted cash includes cash pledged as collateral to secure obligations and all cash whose use is otherwise limited by contractual provisions. The reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash reported within the applicable balance sheet that sum to the total of the same such amounts shown in the statements of cash flows is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,028.4 $ 1,949.9 $ 1,746.3 Restricted cash 112.3 393.4 115.1 Total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 2,140.7 $ 2,343.3 $ 1,861.4 Restricted cash as of December 31, 2021 included advance payments from a customer. Property and Equipment —Property and equipment is recorded at cost or, in the case of acquired properties, at estimated fair value on the date acquired. Cost for self-constructed sites includes direct materials and labor and certain indirect costs associated with construction of the site, such as transportation costs, employee benefits and payroll taxes. The Company begins the capitalization of costs during the pre-construction period, which is the period during which costs are incurred to evaluate the site, and continues to capitalize costs until the site is substantially completed and ready for occupancy by a customer. Labor and related costs capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were $ 65.2 million, $ 59.4 million and $ 51.1 million, respectively. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Augmentation and improvements that extend an asset’s useful life or enhance capacity are capitalized. Depreciation expense is recorded using the straight-line method over the assets’ estimated useful lives. Towers and assets on leased land are depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset taking into consideration the term of the corresponding ground lease and residual value. Towers or assets acquired through finance leases are recorded net at the present value of future minimum lease payments or the fair value of the leased asset at the inception of the lease. Property and equipment and assets held under finance leases are amortized over the shorter of the applicable lease term or the estimated useful life of the respective assets for periods generally not exceeding twenty years . The Company reviews its asset portfolio for indicators of impairment on an individual site basis. Impairments primarily result from a site not having current tenant leases or from having expenses in excess of revenues. The Company reviews other long-lived assets for impairment whenever events, changes in circumstances or other evidence indicate that the carrying amount of the Company’s assets may not be recoverable. The Company records impairment charges, which are discussed in note 16, in Other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the Company identifies such impairment. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets —The Company reviews goodwill for impairment at least annually (as of December 31) or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. F-12 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) Goodwill is recorded in the applicable segment and assessed for impairment at the reporting unit level. The Company employs a discounted cash flow analysis when testing goodwill for impairment. The key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance, terminal revenue growth rate, management’s expectations of future operating results and cash requirements, the current weighted average cost of capital and an expected tax rate. The Company compares the fair value of the reporting unit, as calculated under an income approach using future discounted cash flows, to the carrying amount of the applicable reporting unit. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount of the excess. The loss recognized is limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, no potential goodwill impairment was identified, as the fair value of each of the reporting units was in excess of its carrying amount. Intangible assets that are separable from goodwill and are deemed to have a definite life are amortized over their useful lives, generally ranging from two to twenty years and are evaluated separately for impairment at least annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The Company reviews its network location intangible assets for indicators of impairment on an individual tower basis. Impairments primarily result from a site not having current tenant leases or from having expenses in excess of revenues. The Company monitors its tenant-related intangible assets on a tenant by tenant basis for indicators of impairment, such as high levels of turnover or attrition, the customer’s ability to meet its contractual obligations, non-renewal of a significant number of contracts or the cancellation or termination of a relationship. The Company assesses recoverability by determining whether the carrying amount of the related assets will be recovered primarily through projected undiscounted future cash flows. If the Company determines that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, the Company measures any impairment loss based on the projected future discounted cash flows to be provided from the asset or available market information relative to the asset’s fair value, as compared to the asset’s carrying amount. The Company records impairment charges, which are discussed in note 16, in Other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the Company identifies such impairment. Derivative Financial Instruments —Derivatives are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value. If a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in AOCL, as well as a component of comprehensive income, and are recognized in the results of operations when the hedged item affects earnings. Changes in fair value of the ineffective portions of cash flow hedges are recognized in the results of operations. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, changes in value of the derivatives are recorded in Other expense in the consolidated statements of operations in the current period, along with the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. For derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognized in the results of operations in the period that the change occurs. The primary risks managed through the use of derivative instruments is interest rate risk, exposure to changes in the fair value of debt attributable to interest rate risk and currency risk. From time to time, the Company enters into interest rate swap agreements or foreign currency contracts to manage exposure to these risks. Under these agreements, the Company is exposed to counterparty credit risk to the extent that a counterparty fails to meet the terms of a contract. The Company’s exposure is limited to the current value of the contract at the time the counterparty fails to perform. The Company assesses, both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows or fair values of hedged items. The Company does not hold derivatives for trading purposes. Fair Value Measurements —The Company determines the fair value of its financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Asset Retirement Obligations —When required, the Company recognizes the fair value of obligations to remove its assets and remediate the leased space upon which certain of its assets are located. Generally, the associated retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related assets and depreciated over their estimated useful lives and the liability is accreted through the obligation’s estimated settlement date. Fair value estimates of asset retirement obligations generally involve discounting of estimated future cash flows associated with remediation costs. Periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is included in Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Adjustments are also made to the asset retirement obligation liability to reflect changes in the estimates of timing and amount of expected cash flows, with an offsetting adjustment made to the related long-lived tangible asset. The significant assumptions used in estimating the Company’s aggregate asset retirement obligation are: timing of asset removals; cost of asset removals; F-13 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) timing and number of site lease renewals; expected inflation rates; and credit-adjusted, risk-free interest rates that approximate the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. Income Taxes —As a REIT, the Company generally is not subject to U.S. federal income taxes on income generated by its REIT operations as it receives a dividends paid deduction for distributions to stockholders that generally offsets its REIT income and gains. However, the Company remains obligated to pay U.S. federal income taxes on certain earnings and continues to be subject to taxation in its foreign jurisdictions. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements reflect provisions for federal, state, local and foreign income taxes. The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The Company measures deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company periodically reviews its deferred tax assets, and provides valuation allowances if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets. Valuation allowances would be reversed as a reduction to the provision for income taxes if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based on changes in facts and circumstances relevant to the assets’ recoverability. The Company estimates the liabilities from uncertain tax positions, which are recorded in Other non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet, unless expected to be paid within one year. The Company reports penalties and tax-related interest expense as a component of the income tax provision and interest income from tax refunds as a component of Interest income in the consolidated statements of operations. Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) —Other comprehensive income (loss) refers to items excluded from net income that are recorded as an adjustment to equity, net of tax. The Company’s other comprehensive income (loss) primarily consisted of changes in fair value of effective derivative cash flow hedges, foreign currency translation adjustments, reclassification of unrealized losses on effective derivative cash flow hedges and other items. The AOCL balance included accumulated foreign currency translation losses of $ 5.7 billion, $ 4.7 billion and $ 3.8 billion as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Distributions —As a REIT, the Company must annually distribute to its stockholders an amount equal to at least 90% of its REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain). Generally, the Company has distributed, and expects to continue to distribute, all or substantially all of its REIT taxable income after taking into consideration its utilization of net operating losses (“NOLs”). The amount, timing and frequency of future distributions will be at the sole discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend upon various factors, a number of which may be beyond the Company’s control, including the Company’s financial condition and operating cash flows, the amount required to maintain its qualification for taxation as a REIT and reduce any income and excise taxes that the Company otherwise would be required to pay, limitations on distributions in the Company’s existing and future debt and preferred equity instruments, the Company’s ability to utilize NOLs to offset the Company’s distribution requirements, limitations on its ability to fund distributions using cash generated through its TRSs and other factors that the Board of Directors may deem relevant. Acquisitions —For acquisitions that meet the definition of a business combination, the Company applies the acquisition method of accounting where assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value at the date of each acquisition, and the results of operations are included with those of the Company from the dates of the respective acquisitions. Any excess of the purchase price paid by the Company over the amounts recognized for assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. The Company continues to evaluate acquisitions for a period not to exceed one year after the applicable acquisition date of each transaction to determine whether any additional adjustments are needed to the allocation of the purchase price paid for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. All other acquisitions are accounted for as asset acquisitions and the purchase price is allocated to the net assets acquired with no recognition of goodwill. The purchase price is not subsequently adjusted. The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is typically determined by using either estimates of replacement costs or discounted cash flow valuation methods. When determining the fair value of tangible assets acquired, the Company must estimate the cost to replace the asset with a new asset taking into consideration such factors as age, condition and the economic useful life and productive capacity of the asset. When determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the Company must estimate the timing and amount of future cash flows, including rate and terms of renewal and attrition, and apply the applicable discount rate. F-14 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) Revenue —The Company’s revenue is derived from leasing the right to use its communications sites, the land on which the sites are located and the space in its data center facilities (the “lease component”) and from the reimbursement of costs incurred by the Company in operating the communications sites and data center facilities and supporting its customers’ equipment as well as other services and contractual rights (the “non-lease component”). Most of the Company’s revenue is derived from leasing arrangements and is accounted for as lease revenue unless the timing and pattern of revenue recognition of the non-lease component differs from the lease component. If the timing and pattern of the non-lease component revenue recognition differs from that of the lease component, the Company separately determines the stand-alone selling prices and pattern of revenue recognition for each performance obligation. Revenue related to DAS networks and fiber and other related assets results from agreements with customers that are generally not accounted for as leases. The Company’s revenue from leasing arrangements, including fixed escalation clauses present in non-cancellable lease arrangements, is reported on a straight-line basis over the term of the respective leases when collectibility is probable. Escalation clauses tied to a consumer price index (“CPI”), or other inflation-based indices, and other incentives present in lease agreements with the Company’s tenants are excluded from the straight-line calculation. Total property straight-line revenues for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were $ 499.8 million, $ 465.6 million and $ 322.0 million, respectively. Non-lease property revenue— Non-lease property revenue consists primarily of revenue generated from DAS networks, fiber and other property related revenue. DAS networks and fiber arrangements generally require that the Company provide the tenant the right to use available capacity on the applicable communications infrastructure. Performance obligations are satisfied over time for the duration of the arrangements. Non-lease property revenue also includes revenue generated from interconnection offerings in the Company’s data center facilities. Interconnection offerings are generally contracted on a month-to-month basis and are cancellable by the Company or the data center customer at any time. Performance obligations are satisfied over time for the duration of the arrangements. Other property related revenue streams, which include site inspections, are not material on either an individual or consolidated basis. Services revenue— The Company offers tower-related services in the United States. These services include AZP, structural analysis and construction management. There is a single performance obligation related to AZP and revenue is recognized over time based on milestones achieved, which are determined based on costs expected to be incurred. Structural analysis services may have more than one performance obligation, contingent upon the number of contracted services. Revenue is recognized at the point in time the services are completed. Some of the Company’s contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations. For these arrangements, the Company allocates revenue to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price, which is typically based on the price charged to customers. Since most of the Company’s contracts are leases, costs to enter into lease arrangements are capitalized under the applicable lease accounting guidance. Costs incurred to obtain non-lease contracts that are capitalized primarily relate to DAS networks and are not material to the consolidated financial statements. The Company has excluded sales tax, value added tax and similar taxes from non-lease revenue. Revenue is disaggregated by geography in a manner consistent with the Company’s business segments, which are discussed further in note 20. A summary of revenue disaggregated by source and geography is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2022 U.S. & Canada Asia-Pacific Africa Europe Latin America Data Centers Total Non-lease property revenue $ 295.4 $ 14.3 $ 27.4 $ 16.3 $ 154.5 $ 106.0 $ 613.9 Services revenue 241.1 — — — — — 241.1 Total non-lease revenue $ 536.5 $ 14.3 $ 27.4 $ 16.3 $ 154.5 $ 106.0 $ 855.0 Property lease revenue 4,710.9 1,062.7 1,165.1 719.4 1,537.4 660.6 9,856.1 Total revenue $ 5,247.4 $ 1,077.0 $ 1,192.5 $ 735.7 $ 1,691.9 $ 766.6 $ 10,711.1 F-15 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) Year Ended December 31, 2021 U.S. & Canada Asia-Pacific Africa Europe Latin America Data Centers Total Non-lease property revenue $ 291.9 $ 8.8 $ 24.4 $ 7.6 $ 135.9 $ 1.3 $ 469.9 Services revenue 247.3 — — — — — 247.3 Total non-lease revenue $ 539.2 $ 8.8 $ 24.4 $ 7.6 $ 135.9 $ 1.3 $ 717.2 Property lease revenue 4,628.3 1,190.3 981.1 488.6 1,329.5 21.9 8,639.7 Total revenue $ 5,167.5 $ 1,199.1 $ 1,005.5 $ 496.2 $ 1,465.4 $ 23.2 $ 9,356.9 Year Ended December 31, 2020 U.S. & Canada Asia-Pacific Africa Europe Latin America Total Non-lease property revenue $ 258.4 $ 9.3 $ 13.8 $ 7.9 $ 118.4 $ 407.8 Services revenue 87.9 — — — — 87.9 Total non-lease revenue $ 346.3 $ 9.3 $ 13.8 $ 7.9 $ 118.4 $ 495.7 Property lease revenue 4,258.6 1,130.1 876.4 141.7 1,139.0 7,545.8 Total revenue $ 4,604.9 $ 1,139.4 $ 890.2 $ 149.6 $ 1,257.4 $ 8,041.5 Information about non-lease receivables, contract assets and contract liabilities from contracts with customers is as follows: December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Accounts receivable $ 96.9 $ 121.9 Prepaids and other current assets 39.9 42.6 Notes receivable and other non-current assets 27.1 25.9 Unearned revenue (1) 106.3 128.2 Other non-current liabilities (1) 321.6 372.0 _______________ (1) Includes capital contributions related to DAS networks. The Company records unearned revenue when payments are received from customers in advance of the completion of the Company’s performance obligations. Long-term unearned revenue is included in Other non-current liabilities. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized $ 135.3 million of revenue that was previously included in the contract liabilities balances, primarily arising from balances as of December 31, 2021. The Company records unbilled receivables, which are included in Prepaids and other current assets, when it has completed a performance obligation prior to its ability to bill under the customer arrangement. Other contract assets are included in Notes receivable and other non-current assets. The Company recorded an immaterial change in unbilled receivables attributable to non-lease property revenue recognized during each of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. The change in contract assets attributable to revenue recognized during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $( 0.3 ) million and $ 2.2 million, respectively. The Company does not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for agreements (i) with an original expected length of one year or less or (ii) for which it recognizes revenue at the amount to which it has the right to invoice for services performed. Lease Accounting and Rent Expense —The Company accounts for leases using a right-of-use model, which recognizes that, at the date of commencement, a lessee has a financial obligation to make lease payments to the lessor for the right to use the underlying asset during the lease term. The lessee recognizes a corresponding right-of-use asset related to this right. The Company recognizes a right-of-use lease asset and lease liability for operating and finance leases. The right-of-use asset is measured as the sum of the lease liability, prepaid or accrued lease payments, any initial direct costs incurred and any other applicable amounts. The Company reviews its right-of-use assets for impairment whenever events, changes in circumstances or other evidence indicate that the carrying amount of the Company’s assets may not be recoverable. The Company reviews its right-of-use assets for indicators of impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, as part of its asset portfolio. Impairments primarily result from a site not having current tenant leases or from having expenses in excess of revenues. The Company records impairment charges, which are discussed in note 16, in Other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the Company identifies such impairment. F-16 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) The calculation of the lease liability requires the Company to make certain assumptions for each lease, including lease term and discount rate implicit in each lease, which could significantly impact the gross lease obligation, the duration and the present value of the lease liability. When calculating the lease term, the Company considers the renewal, cancellation and termination rights available to the Company and the lessor. The Company determines the discount rate by calculating the incremental borrowing rate on a collateralized basis at the commencement of a lease or upon a change in the lease term. Many of the leases underlying the Company’s sites have fixed rent escalations, which provide for periodic increases in the amount of ground rent payable by the Company over time. In addition, certain of the Company’s tenant leases require the Company to exercise available renewal options pursuant to the underlying ground lease if the tenant exercises its renewal option. The Company’s calculation of the lease liability includes the term of the underlying ground lease plus all periods, if any, for which failure to renew the lease imposes an economic penalty to the Company such that renewal appears to be reasonably assured. The straight-line component of ground rent expense for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $ 39.6 million, $ 52.7 million and $ 51.6 million, respectively. Selling, General, Administrative and Development Expense —Selling, general and administrative expense consists of overhead expenses related to the Company’s property and services operations and corporate overhead costs not specifically allocable to any of the Company’s individual business operations. Development expense consists of costs related to the Company’s acquisition efforts, costs associated with new business initiatives and project cancellation costs. Stock-Based Compensation —Stock-based compensation expense is measured at the accounting measurement date based on the fair value of the award and is generally recognized as an expense over the service period, which typically represents the vesting period. The Company provides for accelerated vesting and extended exercise periods of stock options and restricted stock units upon an employee’s death or permanent disability, or upon an employee’s qualified retirement, provided certain eligibility criteria are met. Accordingly, the Company recognizes compensation expense for stock options and time-based restricted stock units (“RSUs”) over the shorter of (i) the four-year vesting period or (ii) the period from the date of grant to the date the employee becomes eligible for such benefits due to death, disability or qualified retirement, which may occur upon grant. The expense recognized includes the impact of forfeitures as they occur. The Company grants performance-based restricted stock units (“PSUs”) to its executive officers. Threshold, target and maximum parameters are established for a three-year performance period at the time of grant. The metrics are used to calculate the number of shares that will be issuable when the awards vest, which may range from zero to 200 % of the target amounts. The Company recognizes compensation expense for PSUs over the three-year vesting period, subject to adjustment based on the date the employee becomes eligible for retirement benefits as well as performance relative to grant parameters. The fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and the fair value of RSUs and PSUs is based on the fair value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. The Company recognizes all stock-based compensation expense in Selling, general, administrative and development expense. In connection with the vesting of restricted stock units, the Company withholds from issuance a number of shares of common stock to satisfy certain employee tax withholding obligations arising from such vesting. The shares withheld are considered constructively retired. The Company recognizes the fair value of the shares withheld in Additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has withheld from issuance an aggregate of 2.8 million shares, including 0.2 million shares related to the vesting of restricted stock units during the year ended December 31, 2022. Litigation Costs —The Company periodically becomes involved in various claims and lawsuits that are incidental to its business. The Company regularly monitors the status of pending legal actions to evaluate both the magnitude and likelihood of any potential loss. The Company accrues for these potential losses when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss, or possible range of loss, can be reasonably estimated. Should the ultimate losses on contingencies or litigation vary from estimates, adjustments to those liabilities may be required. The Company also incurs legal costs in connection with these matters and records estimates of these expenses, which are reflected in Selling, general, administrative and development expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Earnings Per Common Share — Basic and Diluted —Basic net income per common share represents net income attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per common share represents net income attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period and any dilutive common share equivalents, including (A) shares issuable upon the vesting of RSUs and exercise of stock options and F-17 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) (B) shares expected to be earned upon the achievement of the parameters established for PSUs, each to the extent not anti-dilutive. The Company uses the treasury stock method to calculate the effect of its outstanding RSUs, PSUs and stock options. Retirement Plan —The Company has a 401(k) plan covering nearly all eligible employees who meet certain age and employment requirements. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company matched 100 % of the first 5 % of a participant's contributions. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company contributed $ 16.9 million, $ 14.9 million and $ 13.2 million to the plan, respectively. 2.

Total depreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $ 1,552.6 million, $ 1,036.2 million and $ 924.3 million, respectively. Depreciation expense includes amounts related to finance lease assets for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 of $ 145.4 million, $ 146.8 million and $ 153.0 million, respectively.

LEASES The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at the inception of the agreement. The Company considers an arrangement to be a lease if it conveys the right to control the use of the communications infrastructure or ground space underneath communications infrastructure for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The Company is both a lessor and a lessee. Lessor —The Company is a lessor in most of its revenue arrangements, as property revenue is derived from tenant leases of specifically-identified, physically distinct space on or in the Company’s communications real estate assets. The Company’s lease arrangements with its tenants for its communications sites vary depending upon the region and the industry of the tenant and generally have initial non-cancellable terms of five to ten years with multiple renewal terms. The leases also contain provisions that periodically increase the rent due, typically annually, based on a fixed escalation percentage or an inflationary index, or a combination of both. The Company structures its leases to include financial penalties if a tenant terminates the lease, which serve to disincentivize tenants from terminating the lease prior to the expiration of the lease term. The Company’s leasing arrangements outside of the United States may require that the Company provide power to the communications site through an electrical grid connection, diesel fuel generators or other sources and permit the Company to pass through the costs of, or otherwise charge for, these services. Many arrangements require that the communications site has power for a specified percentage of time. In most cases, if delivery of power falls below the specified service level, a corresponding reduction in revenue is recorded. The Company has determined that this performance obligation is satisfied over time for the duration of the lease. In addition, the Company provides power to its data center customers, which is passed through, or otherwise charged, to customers pursuant to the terms of the customer power arrangement. Customer power arrangements are coterminous with such customer’s underlying lease and have the same pattern of transfer over the lease term. This performance obligation is generally satisfied over time for the duration of the lease. Fixed power revenue is recognized each month over the term of the lease. For variable power arrangements, the Company recognizes revenue each month as the uncertainty related to the consideration is resolved. The Company typically has more than one tenant on a site and, by performing ordinary course repair and maintenance work, can often lease a site, either through renewing existing agreements or leasing to new tenants, for periods beyond the existing tenant lease term. Accordingly, the Company has minimal risk with respect to the residual value of its leased assets. Communications infrastructure assets are depreciated over their estimated useful lives, which generally do not exceed twenty years . As of December 31, 2022, the Company does not have any material related party leases as a lessor. To the extent there are any intercompany leases, these are eliminated in consolidation. The Company generally does not enter into sales-type leases or direct financing leases. The Company’s leases generally do not include any incentives for the lessee, however, if incentives are present, they are evaluated to determine proper treatment and, to the extent present, are recorded in Other current assets and F-19 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) Other non-current assets in the consolidated balance sheets and amortized over the corresponding lease term as a component of revenue. In addition, the Company’s leases do not include any lessee purchase options. Historically, the Company has been able to successfully renew its applicable leases as needed to ensure continuation of its revenue. Accordingly, the Company assumes that it will have access to the communications infrastructure or ground space underlying its sites when calculating future minimum rental receipts through the end of the respective terms. Future minimum rental receipts expected under non-cancellable operating lease agreements as of December 31, 2022, were as follows: Fiscal Year Amount (1) (2) 2023 $ 7,658.4 2024 7,331.1 2025 6,904.3 2026 6,428.9 2027 6,284.1 Thereafter 27,746.0 Total $ 62,352.8 _______________ (1) Balances are translated at the applicable period-end exchange rate, which may impact comparability between periods. (2) Balances represent contractual amounts owned with no adjustments made for expected collectibility. Lessee —The Company enters into arrangements as a lessee primarily for ground space underneath its communications sites. These arrangements are typically long-term lease agreements with initial non-cancellable terms of approximately five to ten years with one or more automatic or exercisable renewal periods and specified increases in lease payments upon exercise of the renewal options. The Company typically exercises its ground lease renewal options in order to provide ongoing tenant space on or in its communications sites through the end of the tenant lease term. Escalation clauses present in operating leases, excluding those tied to CPI or other inflation-based indices, are recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated lease term of the applicable lease as a component of rent expense. Additionally, the escalations tied to CPI or another inflation-based index are considered variable lease payments. In certain circumstances, the Company enters into revenue sharing arrangements with the ground space owner, which results in variability in lease payments. In most markets outside of the United States, in the event there are no tenants on the communications site, the Company generally has unilateral termination rights and in certain situations, the lease is structured to allow for termination by the Company with minimal or no penalties. Ground lease arrangements usually include annual escalations and do not contain any residual value guarantees or restrictions on dividends, other financial obligations or other similar terms. The Company has entered into certain transactions whereby at the end of a lease, sublease or similar arrangement, the Company has the option to purchase the corresponding communications sites. These transactions are further described in note 18. The Company’s lease liability is the present value of the remaining minimum rental payments to be made over the remaining lease term, including renewal options reasonably certain to be exercised. The Company also considers termination options and factors those into the determination of lease payments when appropriate. To determine the lease term, the Company considers all renewal periods that are reasonably certain to be exercised, taking into consideration all economic factors, including the communications site’s estimated economic life (generally twenty years ) and the respective lease terms of the Company’s tenants under the existing lease arrangements on such site. The Company assesses its right-of-use asset and other lease-related assets for impairment, as described in note 1. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded $ 8.1 million, $ 3.3 million and $ 76.1 million, respectively, of impairment expense related to these assets. As of December 31, 2022, the Company does not have any material related party leases as a lessee. The Company does not have any sale-leaseback arrangements as lessee and typically does not enter into leveraged leases. The Company leases certain land, buildings, equipment and office space under operating leases and land and improvements, towers, equipment and vehicles under finance leases. As of December 31, 2022, operating lease assets were included in Right-of-use asset and finance lease assets were included in Property and equipment, net in the consolidated balance sheet.

The incremental borrowing rate reflects the cost to borrow on a securitized basis in each market. The remaining lease term does not reflect all renewal options available to the Company, only those renewal options that the Company has assessed as reasonably certain of being exercised taking into consideration the economic and other factors noted above.

Asia-Pacific consists of $ 9.2 million of additions related to the acquisition of Kirtonkhola Tower Bangladesh Limited and measurement period adjustments related to the InSite Acquisition. Europe and Latin America consist of additions and measurement period adjustments related to the Telxius Acquisition (as defined in note 6). Data Centers consists of $ 3.0 billion of additions related to data center acquisitions, primarily from the CoreSite Acquisition (as defined in note 6). (2) Europe and Latin America consist of measurement period adjustments related to the Telxius Acquisition. Data Centers consists of measurement period adjustments related to the CoreSite Acquisition. (3) Other represents the goodwill associated with certain operations acquired in connection with the InSite Acquisition. These business operations were sold during the year ended December 31, 2022. The Company’s other intangible assets subject to amortization consisted of the following: As of December 31, 2022 As of December 31, 2021 Estimated Useful Lives (years) Gross Carrying Value Accumulated Amortization Net Book Value Gross Carrying Value Accumulated Amortization Net Book Value Acquired network location intangibles (1) Up to 20 $ 6,058.2 $ ( 2,537.9 ) $ 3,520.3 $ 6,294.6 $ ( 2,305.1 ) $ 3,989.5 Acquired tenant-related intangibles Up to 20 18,941.2 ( 5,827.7 ) 13,113.5 20,030.5 ( 5,051.5 ) 14,979.0 Acquired licenses and other intangibles 2 - 20 1,772.9 ( 423.4 ) 1,349.5 1,807.9 ( 49.2 ) 1,758.7 Total other intangible assets $ 26,772.3 $ ( 8,789.0 ) $ 17,983.3 $ 28,133.0 $ ( 7,405.8 ) $ 20,727.2 _______________ (1) Acquired network location intangibles are amortized over the shorter of the term of the corresponding ground lease, taking into consideration lease renewal options and residual value, generally up to 20 years, as the Company considers these intangibles to be directly related to the tower assets. The acquired network location intangibles represent the value to the Company of the incremental revenue growth that could potentially be obtained from leasing the excess capacity on acquired tower communications infrastructure. The acquired tenant-related intangibles typically represent the value to the Company of tenant contracts and relationships in place at the time of an acquisition or similar transaction, including assumptions regarding estimated renewals. Other intangibles represent the value of acquired licenses, trade name and in place leases. In place lease value represents the fair value of costs avoided in securing data center customers, including vacancy periods, legal costs and commissions. In place lease value also includes assumptions on similar costs avoided upon the renewal or extension of existing leases on a basis consistent with occupancy assumptions used in the fair value of other assets. The Company amortizes its acquired intangible assets on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. As of December 31, 2022, the remaining weighted average amortization period of the Company’s intangible assets wa s 15 years . Amortization of intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $ 1.7 billion, $ 1.2 billion and $ 0.9 billion, respectively. F-23 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) Based on current exchange rates, the Company expects to record amortization expense as follows over the next five years: Fiscal Year Amount 2023 $ 1,424.5 2024 1,338.5 2025 1,286.0 2026 1,233.4 2027 1,219.9 6. ACQUISITIONS The Company evaluates each of its acquisitions under the accounting guidance framework to determine whether to treat an acquisition as an asset acquisition or a business combination. For those transactions treated as asset acquisitions, the purchase price is allocated to the assets or rights acquired and liabilities assumed, with no recognition of goodwill. For those transactions treated as business combinations, the estimates of the fair value of the assets or rights acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of the applicable acquisition are subject to adjustment during the measurement period (up to one year from the particular acquisition date). The fair value of these net assets acquired are based on management’s estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. While the Company believes that such preliminary estimates provide a reasonable basis for estimating the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, it evaluates any necessary information prior to finalization of the fair value. During the measurement period for those acquisitions accounted for as business combinations, the Company will adjust assets or liabilities if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have resulted in the revised estimated values of those assets or liabilities as of that date. Impact of current year acquisitions —The Company typically acquires communications sites and other communications infrastructure assets from wireless carriers or other tower operators and subsequently integrates those sites and related assets into its existing portfolio of communications sites and related assets. In the United States, acquisitions may also include data center facilities and related assets. The financial results of the Company’s acquisitions have been included in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 from the date of the respective acquisition. The date of acquisition, and by extension the point at which the Company begins to recognize the results of an acquisition, may depend on, among other things, the receipt of contractual consents, the commencement and extent of leasing arrangements and the timing of the transfer of title or rights to the assets, which may be accomplished in phases. Communications sites acquired from communications service providers may never have been operated as a business and may instead have been utilized solely by the seller as a component of its network infrastructure. An acquisition may or may not involve the transfer of business operations or employees. For those acquisitions accounted for as business combinations, the Company recognizes acquisition and merger related expenses in the period in which they are incurred and services are received; for transactions accounted for as asset acquisitions, these costs are capitalized as part of the purchase price. Acquisition and merger related costs may include finder’s fees, advisory, legal, accounting, valuation and other professional or consulting fees and general administrative costs directly related to completing the transaction. Integration costs include incremental and non-recurring costs necessary to convert data and systems, retain employees and otherwise enable the Company to operate acquired businesses or assets efficiently. The Company records acquisition and merger related expenses for business combinations, as well as integration costs for all acquisitions, in Other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded acquisition and merger related expenses for business combinations and non-capitalized asset acquisition costs and integration costs as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Acquisition and merger related expenses $ 57.0 $ 177.0 $ 15.5 Integration costs $ 45.0 $ 50.4 $ 23.1 During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded net benefits of $ 15.1 million, $ 17.6 million and $ 4.4 million related to pre-acquisition contingencies and settlements, respectively. The year ended December 31, 2022 included acquisition and merger related costs associated with the Stonepeak Transaction (as defined in note 15). The year ended F-24 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) December 31, 2021 included acquisition and merger related costs associated with the Telxius Acquisition and the CoreSite Acquisition (each as defined below). 2022 Transactions The estimated aggregate impact of the acquisitions completed in 2022 on the Company’s revenues and gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2022 was approximately $ 6.8 million and $ 4.8 million, respectively. The revenues and gross margin amounts also reflect incremental revenues from the addition of new customers to such communications infrastructure assets subsequent to the transaction date. Acquisitions completed in 2022 were included in all of the Company’s property segments. Spain Fiber Acquisition —During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company acquired fiber connected to the Company’s communications sites in Spain from Telefónica de España S.A.U. for an aggregate total purchase price of 120.1 million Euro (“EUR”) (approximately $ 128.8 million at the dates of closing), including value added tax.

The Series 2015-2 Notes were issued by GTP Acquisition Partners pursuant to a Third Amended and Restated Indenture and related series supplements, each dated as of May 29, 2015 (collectively, the “2015 Indenture”), between GTP Acquisition Partners and its subsidiaries (the “GTP Entities”) and The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee. The effective weighted average life and interest rate of the 2015 Notes was 8.1 years and 3.029 %, respectively, as of the date of issuance. The outstanding Series 2015-2 Notes are secured by (i) mortgages, deeds of trust and deeds to secure debt on substantially all of the 3,516 communications sites (the “2015 Secured Sites”) owned by the GTP Entities and their operating cash flows, (ii) a security interest in substantially all of the personal property and fixtures of the GTP Entities, including GTP Acquisition Partners’ equity interests in its subsidiaries and (iii) the rights of the GTP Entities under a management agreement. American Tower Holding Sub II, LLC, whose only material assets are its equity interests in GTP Acquisition Partners, has guaranteed repayment of the Series 2015-2 Notes and pledged its equity interests in GTP Acquisition Partners as security for such payment obligations. Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2013-2A , Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2018-1, Subclass A and Series 2018-1, Subclass R —On March 29, 2018, the Company completed a securitization transaction (the “2018 Securitization”), in which the American Tower Trust I (the “Trust”) issued $ 500.0 million aggregate principal amount of Secured Tower Revenue F-33 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) Securities, Series 2018-1, Subclass A (the “Series 2018-1A Securities”). To satisfy the applicable risk retention requirements of Regulation RR promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act” and, such requirements, the “Risk Retention Rules”), the Trust issued, and one of the Company’s affiliates purchased, $ 26.4 million aggregate principal amount of Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2018-1, Subclass R (the “Series 2018-1R Securities” and, together with the Series 2018-1A Securities, the “2018 Securities”) to retain an “eligible horizontal residual interest” (as defined in the Risk Retention Rules) in an amount equal to at least 5% of the fair value of the 2018 Securities. The Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2013-2A (the “Series 2013-2A Securities” and, together with the 2018 Securities the “Trust Securities”) issued in a securitization transaction in March 2013 (the “2013 Securitization” and, together with the 2018 Securitization, the “Trust Securitizations”) remain outstanding and are subject to the terms of the Second Amended and Restated Trust and Servicing Agreement entered into in connection with the 2018 Securitization. The assets of the Trust consist of a nonrecourse loan (the “Loan”) made by the Trust to American Tower Asset Sub, LLC and American Tower Asset Sub II, LLC (together, the “AMT Asset Subs”). The AMT Asset Subs are jointly and severally liable under the Loan, which is secured primarily by mortgages on the AMT Asset Subs’ interests in 5,102 broadcast and wireless communications towers and related assets (the “Trust Sites”). The component of the Loan corresponding to the Series 2013-2A Securities also remains outstanding and is subject to the terms of the Second Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement among the Trust and the AMT Asset Subs, dated as of March 29, 2018 (the “Loan Agreement”). The Loan Agreement includes terms and conditions, including with respect to secured assets, substantially consistent with the First Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement dated as of March 15, 2013. The 2018 Securities correspond to components of the Loan made to the AMT Asset Subs pursuant to the Loan Agreement and were issued in two separate subclasses of the same series. The 2018 Securities represent a pass-through interest in the components of the Loan corresponding to the 2018 Securities. The Series 2018-1A Securities have an interest rate of 3.652 % and the Series 2018-1R Securities have an interest rate of 4.459 %. The 2018 Securities have an expected life of approximately ten years with a final repayment date in March 2048. Subject to certain limited exceptions described below, no payments of principal will be required to be made on the components of the Loan corresponding to the 2018 Securities prior to the monthly payment date in March 2028, which is the anticipated repayment date for such components. The Loan is secured by (1) mortgages, deeds of trust and deeds to secure debt on substantially all of the Trust Sites and their operating cash flows, (2) a security interest in substantially all of the AMT Asset Subs’ personal property and fixtures and (3) the AMT Asset Subs’ rights under that certain management agreement among the AMT Asset Subs and SpectraSite Communications, LLC entered into in March 2013. American Tower Holding Sub, LLC (the “Guarantor”), whose only material assets are its equity interests in each of the AMT Asset Subs, and American Tower Guarantor Sub, LLC whose only material asset is its equity interests in the Guarantor, have each guaranteed repayment of the Loan and pledged their equity interests in their respective subsidiary or subsidiaries as security for such payment obligations. Under the terms of the Loan Agreement and the 2015 Indenture, amounts due will be paid from the cash flows generated by the Trust Sites or the 2015 Secured Sites, respectively, which must be deposited into certain reserve accounts, and thereafter distributed, solely pursuant to the terms of the Loan Agreement or 2015 Indenture, as applicable. On a monthly basis, after payment of all required amounts under the Loan Agreement or 2015 Indenture, as applicable, including interest payments, subject to the conditions described below, the excess cash flows generated from the operation of such assets are released to the AMT Asset Subs or GTP Acquisition Partners, as applicable, which can then be distributed to, and used by, the Company. In order to distribute any excess cash flow to the Company, the AMT Asset Subs and GTP Acquisition Partners must each maintain a specified debt service coverage ratio (the “DSCR”), which is generally calculated as the ratio of the net cash flow (as defined in the applicable agreement) to the amount of interest, servicing fees and trustee fees required to be paid over the succeeding 12 months on the principal amount of the Loan or the 2015 Notes, as applicable, that will be outstanding on the payment date following such date of determination. If the DSCR were equal to or below 1.30 x (the “Cash Trap DSCR”) for any quarter, then all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments, fund required reserves, pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and make other payments required under the applicable transaction documents, referred to as excess cash flow, will be deposited into a reserve account (the “Cash Trap Reserve Account”) instead of being released to the AMT Asset Subs or GTP Acquisition Partners, as applicable. The funds in the Cash Trap Reserve Account will not be released to the AMT Asset Subs or GTP Acquisition Partners, as applicable, unless the DSCR exceeds the Cash Trap DSCR for two consecutive calendar quarters. Additionally, an “amortization period” commences if, as of the end of any calendar quarter, the DSCR is equal to or below 1.15 x (the “Minimum DSCR”) and will continue to exist until the DSCR exceeds the Minimum DSCR for two consecutive calendar quarters. With respect to the Trust Securities, an “amortization period” also commences if, on the anticipated F-34 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) repayment date the component of the Loan corresponding to the applicable subclass of the Trust Securities has not been repaid in full, provided that such amortization period shall apply with respect to such component that has not been repaid in full. If the Series 2015-2 Notes have not been repaid in full on the applicable anticipated repayment date, additional interest will accrue on the unpaid principal balance of the Series 2015-2 Notes, and such notes will begin to amortize on a monthly basis from excess cash flow. During an amortization period, all excess cash flow and any amounts then in the applicable Cash Trap Reserve Account would be applied to pay the principal of the Loan or the Series 2015-2 Notes, as applicable, on each monthly payment date. The Loan and the Series 2015-2 Notes may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time, provided such payment is accompanied by the applicable prepayment consideration. If the prepayment occurs within 18 months of the anticipated repayment date with respect to the Series 2013-2A Securities or the Series 2015-2 Notes, or 36 months of the anticipated repayment date with respect to the Series 2018 Securities, no prepayment consideration is due. The Loan Agreement and the 2015 Indenture include operating covenants and other restrictions customary for transactions subject to rated securitizations. Among other things, the AMT Asset Subs and the GTP Entities, as applicable, are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets subject to customary carve-outs for ordinary course trade payables and permitted encumbrances (as defined in the Loan Agreement or the 2015 Indenture, as applicable). The organizational documents of the AMT Asset Subs and the GTP Entities contain provisions consistent with rating agency securitization criteria for special purpose entities, including the requirement that they maintain independent directors. The Loan Agreement and the 2015 Indenture also contain certain covenants that require the AMT Asset Subs or GTP Acquisition Partners, as applicable, to provide the respective trustee with regular financial reports and operating budgets, promptly notify such trustee of events of default and material breaches under the Loan Agreement and other agreements related to the Trust Sites or the 2015 Indenture and other agreements related to the 2015 Secured Sites, as applicable, and allow the applicable trustee reasonable access to the sites, including the right to conduct site investigations. A failure to comply with the covenants in the Loan Agreement or the 2015 Indenture could prevent the AMT Asset Subs or GTP Acquisition Partners, as applicable, from distributing excess cash flow to the Company. Furthermore, if the AMT Asset Subs or GTP Acquisition Partners were to default on the Loan or the Series 2015-2 Notes, the applicable trustee may seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of all or any portion of the Trust Sites or the 2015 Secured Sites, respectively, in which case the Company could lose the revenue and cash flows associated with those assets. With respect to the Series 2015-2 Notes, upon the occurrence of, and during, an event of default, the applicable trustee may, in its discretion or at the direction of holders of more than 50 % of the aggregate outstanding principal of the Series 2015-2 Notes, declare such notes immediately due and payable, in which case any excess cash flow would need to be used to pay holders of such notes. Further, under the Loan Agreement and the 2015 Indenture, the AMT Asset Subs or GTP Acquisition Partners, respectively, are required to maintain reserve accounts, including for ground rents, real estate and personal property taxes and insurance premiums, and, under the 2015 Indenture and in certain circumstances under the Loan Agreement, to reserve a portion of advance rents from tenants on the Trust Sites. Based on the terms of the Loan Agreement and the 2015 Indenture, all rental cash receipts received for each month are reserved for the succeeding month and held in an account controlled by the applicable trustee and then released. The $ 68.7 million held in the reserve accounts with respect to the Trust Securitizations and the $ 9.7 million held in the reserve accounts with respect to the 2015 Securitization as of December 31, 2022 are classified as Restricted cash on the Company’s accompanying consolidated balance sheets. India Indebtedness — The India indebtedness includes several working capital facilities, most of which are subject to annual renewal. The working capital facilities bear interest at rates that consist of the applicable bank’s Marginal Cost of Funds based Lending Rate or Market Benchmark (as defined in the applicable agreement), plus a spread. Generally, the working capital facilities are payable on demand prior to maturity. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has not borrowed under these facilities.

During the year ended December 31, 2022, we drew on letters of credit in Nigeria. The drawn amounts bear interest at a rate equal to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate at the time of drawing plus a spread. Amounts are due 270 days from the date of drawing. (2) Denominated in USD, with an original principal amount of $ 51.8 million. The loan agreement for the Kenya Debt required that the debt be paid either (i) in future installments subject to the satisfaction of specified conditions or (ii) five years from the note origination date, including the exercise of an optional two year extension, subject to the satisfaction of specified conditions. As of December 31, 2022, there are no amounts outstanding under the Kenya Debt. (3) Related to a seller-financed acquisition. Denominated in USD with an original principal amount of $ 2.5 million. Repaid in full during the year ended December 31, 2022. Each of the agreements governing the other subsidiary debt contains contractual covenants and other restrictions. Failure to comply with certain of the financial and operating covenants could constitute a default under the applicable debt agreement, which could result in, among other things, the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable. CoreSite Debt — The CoreSite Debt included senior unsecured notes previously entered into by CoreSite. The Company acquired this debt in connection with the CoreSite Acquisition. The CoreSite Debt was recorded at fair value upon the closing of the CoreSite Acquisition. On January 7, 2022, the Company repaid the entire amount outstanding under the CoreSite Debt, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, January 7, 2022, for an aggregate redemption price of $ 962.9 million, including $ 80.1 million of prepayment consideration and $ 7.8 million in accrued and unpaid interest.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS The Company determines the fair value of its financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Below are the three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date. Level 2 Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Items Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis — The fair values of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities that are required to be measured on a recurring basis at fair value were as follows: December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Fair Value Measurements Using Fair Value Measurements Using Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Assets: Interest rate swap agreements — — — — $ 11.0 — Investments in equity securities (1) $ 29.2 — — $ 37.1 — — Liabilities: Interest rate swap agreements — $ 6.2 — — — — Fair value of debt related to interest rate swap agreements (2) $ ( 4.9 ) — — $ 12.2 — — F-37 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) _______________ (1) Investments in equity securities are recorded in Notes receivable and other non-current assets in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value. Unrealized holding gains and losses for equity securities are recorded in Other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations in the current period. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 , the Company recognized unrealized (losses) gains of $( 16.7 ) million and $ 6.1 million, respectively, for equity securities held as of December 31, 2022. (2) Included in the carrying values of the corresponding debt obligations. Interest Rate Swap Agreements The fair value of the Company’s interest rate swap agreements is determined using pricing models with inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, changes in the value of the derivatives are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in the current period, along with the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the Company records the change in fair value for the effective portion of the cash flow hedges in AOCL in the consolidated balance sheets and reclassifies a portion of the value from AOCL into Interest expense on a quarterly basis as the cash flows from the hedged item affects earnings. The Company records the settlement of interest rate swap agreements in (Loss) gain on retirement of long-term obligations in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the settlement occurs. The Company entered into three interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional value of $ 500.0 million related to the 3.000 % senior unsecured notes due 2023 (the “ 3.000 % Notes”). These interest rate swaps, which were designated as fair value hedges at inception, were entered into to hedge against changes in fair value of the 3.000 % Notes resulting from changes in interest rates. The interest rate swap agreements require the Company to pay interest at a variable interest rate of one-month LIBOR plus applicable spreads and to receive fixed interest at a rate of 3.000 % through June 15, 2023. The Company entered into three interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional value of $ 600.0 million related to the 2.250 % Notes. These interest rate swaps, which were designated as fair value hedges at inception, were entered into to hedge against changes in fair value of the 2.250 % Notes resulting from changes in interest rates. The interest rate swap agreements required the Company to pay interest at a variable interest rate of one-month LIBOR plus applicable spreads and to receive fixed interest at a rate of 2.250 % through January 15, 2022. The interest rate swap agreements expired upon repayment of the 2.250 % Notes in full on January 14, 2022 upon maturity. As of December 31, 2022, there were no amounts outstanding under the interest rate swap agreements under the 2.250 % Notes. The fair value of the U.S. interest rate swap liability of $ 6.2 million was included in accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2022. The fair value of the U.S. interest rate swap asset of $ 11.0 million was included in Other non-current assets on the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded net fair value adjustments of $( 0.1 ) million related to interest rate swaps and the change in fair value of debt due to interest rate swaps in Other expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Items Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis Assets Held and Used —The Company’s long-lived assets are recorded at amortized cost and, if impaired, are adjusted to fair value using Level 3 inputs. During the year ended December 31, 2022, certain long-lived assets held and used with a carrying value of $ 46.1 billion were written down to their net realizable value as a result of an asset impairment charge of $ 655.9 million. During the year ended December 31, 2021, certain long-lived assets held and used with a carrying value of $ 49.0 billion were written down to their net realizable value as a result of an asset impairment charge of $ 173.7 million. The asset impairment charges are recorded in Other operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations . These adjustments were determined by comparing the estimated fair value utilizing projected future discounted cash flows to be provided from the long-lived assets to the asset’s carrying value. There were no other items measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during the year ended December 31, 2022. Fair Value of Financial Instruments —The Company’s financial instruments for which the carrying value reasonably approximates fair value at December 31, 2022 and 2021 include cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable and accounts payable. The Company’s estimates of fair value of its long-term obligations, including the current portion, are based primarily upon reported market values. For long-term debt not actively traded, fair value is estimated using either indicative price quotes or a discounted cash flow analysis using rates for debt with similar terms and maturities. As of December 31, 2022, the carrying value and fair value of long-term obligations, including the current portion, were $ 38.7 billion and $ 35.1 billion, respectively, of which $ 24.5 billion was measured using Level 1 inputs and $ 10.6 billion was measured using F-38 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) Level 2 inputs. As of December 31, 2021, the carrying value and fair value of long-term obligations, including the current portion, were $ 43.3 billion and $ 44.1 billion, respectively, of which $ 28.5 billion was measured using Level 1 inputs and $ 15.6 billion was measured using Level 2 inputs. 12. INCOME TAXES Beginning in the taxable year ended December 31, 2012, the Company has filed, and intends to continue to file, U.S. federal income tax returns as a REIT, and its domestic TRSs filed, and intend to continue to file, separate tax returns as required. The Company also files tax returns in various states and countries. The Company’s state tax returns reflect different combinations of the Company’s subsidiaries and are dependent on the connection each subsidiary has with a particular state and form of organization. The following information pertains to the Company’s income taxes on a consolidated basis. The income tax provision from continuing operations consisted of the following: Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Current: Federal $ ( 6.5 ) $ ( 26.0 ) $ 8.7 State ( 5.8 ) ( 9.3 ) ( 10.7 ) Foreign ( 248.4 ) ( 267.7 ) ( 150.1 ) Deferred: Federal ( 2.8 ) 0.0 ( 1.0 ) State 0.8 ( 2.5 ) ( 1.0 ) Foreign 238.7 43.7 24.5 Income tax provision $ ( 24.0 ) $ ( 261.8 ) $ ( 129.6 ) The effective tax rate (“ETR”) on income from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the Company’s qualification for taxation as a REIT, as well as adjustments for state and foreign items. As a REIT, the Company may deduct earnings distributed to stockholders against the income generated by its REIT operations. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the change in the income tax provision was primarily attributable to a reduction in taxable income due to impairment charges in India and the release of valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions. The decrease in the income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2022 included the reversal of valuation allowances of $ 76.5 million in certain jurisdictions, as compared to a reversal of $ 26.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. These valuation allowance reversals were recognized as a reduction to the income tax provision as the net related deferred tax assets were deemed realizable based on changes in facts and circumstances relevant to the assets’ recoverability. Reconciliation between the U.S. statutory rate and the effective rate from continuing operations is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Statutory tax rate 21 % 21 % 21 % Adjustment to reflect REIT status (1) ( 21 ) ( 21 ) ( 21 ) Foreign taxes ( 1 ) 3 4 Foreign withholding taxes 4 2 3 Uncertain tax positions 2 4 1 Changes in valuation allowance ( 4 ) ( 0 ) ( 1 ) Effective tax rate 1 % 9 % 7 % _______________ (1) As a result of the ability to utilize the dividends paid deduction to offset the Company’s REIT income and gains. F-39 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) The domestic and foreign components of income from continuing operations before income taxes are as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 United States $ 1,973.2 $ 2,517.4 $ 1,683.0 Foreign ( 252.5 ) 312.0 138.1 Total $ 1,720.7 $ 2,829.4 $ 1,821.1 The components of the net deferred tax asset and liability and related valuation allowance were as follows: December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Assets: Operating lease liability $ 1,117.4 $ 1,171.8 Net operating loss carryforwards 265.5 270.1 Accrued asset retirement obligations 238.5 228.0 Stock-based compensation 8.1 7.0 Unearned revenue 32.7 36.7 Unrealized loss on foreign currency 24.4 22.0 Other accruals and allowances 84.1 90.1 Nondeductible interest 93.4 76.2 Tax credits 106.8 82.4 Items not currently deductible and other 50.1 45.4 Liabilities: Depreciation and amortization ( 1,792.6 ) ( 2,128.2 ) Right-of-use asset ( 1,118.5 ) ( 1,160.7 ) Deferred rent ( 113.0 ) ( 108.1 ) Other ( 24.0 ) ( 2.7 ) Subtotal ( 1,027.1 ) ( 1,370.0 ) Valuation allowance ( 335.7 ) ( 329.3 ) Net deferred tax liabilities $ ( 1,362.8 ) $ ( 1,699.3 ) The Company provides valuation allowances if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management assesses the available evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets. Valuation allowances may be reversed if, based on changes in facts and circumstances, the net deferred tax assets have been determined to be realizable. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company has provided a valuation allowance of $ 335.7 million and $ 329.3 million, respectively, which primarily relates to foreign items. The increase in the valuation allowance for the year ending December 31, 2022 is due to uncertainty as to the timing of, and the Company’s ability to recover, net deferred tax assets in certain foreign operations in the foreseeable future, offset by reversals and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if objective evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight may be given to subjective evidence such as the Company’s projections for growth. A summary of the activity in the valuation allowance is as follows: 2022 2021 2020 Balance as of January 1, $ 329.3 $ 228.5 $ 194.2 Additions (1) 93.9 146.3 64.7 Usage, expiration and reversals ( 76.5 ) ( 26.2 ) ( 22.0 ) Foreign currency translation ( 11.0 ) ( 19.3 ) ( 8.4 ) Balance as of December 31, $ 335.7 $ 329.3 $ 228.5 _______________ (1) Includes net charges to expense and allowances established due to acquisition. F-40 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) The recoverability of the Company’s deferred tax assets has been assessed utilizing projections based on its current operations. Accordingly, the recoverability of the deferred tax assets is not dependent on material asset sales or other non-routine transactions. Based on its current outlook of future taxable income during the carryforward period, the Company believes that deferred tax assets, other than those for which a valuation allowance has been recorded, will be realized. At December 31, 2022, the Company had net federal, state and foreign operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income. If not utilized, the Company’s NOLs expire as follows: Years ended December 31, Federal State Foreign 2023 to 2027 $ 0.0 $ 185.0 $ 5.1 2028 to 2032 0.1 97.5 22.4 2033 to 2037 67.5 90.4 1.5 2038 to 2042 — 100.0 10.0 Indefinite carryforward 241.1 51.7 917.2 Total $ 308.7 $ 524.6 $ 956.2 As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would impact the ETR, if recognized, is $ 103.6 million and $ 94.8 million, respectively. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits for the year ended December 31, 2022 includes additions to the Company’s existing tax positions of $ 35.1 million. The Company expects the unrecognized tax benefits to change over the next 12 months if certain tax matters ultimately settle with the applicable taxing jurisdiction during this timeframe, or if the applicable statute of limitations lapses. The impact of the amount of such changes to previously recorded uncertain tax positions could range from zero to $ 18.0 million. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits are as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Balance at January 1 $ 108.8 $ 136.2 $ 175.6 Additions based on tax positions related to the current year 13.3 7.5 4.7 Additions and reductions for tax positions of prior years (1) (2) 18.2 ( 17.5 ) ( 5.0 ) Foreign currency ( 5.3 ) ( 3.7 ) ( 9.6 ) Reduction as a result of the lapse of statute of limitations ( 0.6 ) ( 4.9 ) ( 26.0 ) Reduction as a result of effective settlements ( 18.9 ) ( 8.8 ) ( 3.5 ) Balance at December 31 $ 115.5 $ 108.8 $ 136.2 _______________ (1) Year ended December 31, 2021 includes adjustments of $( 16.6 ) million due to a reclassification of unrecognized tax benefits to penalties and income tax-related interest expense. (2) Year ended December 31, 2020 includes adjustments of $( 21.0 ) million for positions related to the Eaton Towers Acquisition that were revised in connection with settlements or effective settlements. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the statute of limitations on certain unrecognized tax benefits lapsed and certain positions were effectively settled, including effective settlements and revisions of prior year positions, which resulted in a decrease of $ 23.1 million in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the statute of limitations on certain unrecognized tax benefits lapsed and certain positions were effectively settled, including effective settlements and revisions of prior year positions, which resulted in a decrease of $ 54.2 million in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the statute of limitations on certain unrecognized tax benefits lapsed and certain positions were effectively settled, including effective settlements and revisions of prior year positions related to the Eaton Towers Acquisition, which resulted in a decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $ 50.5 million. The Company recorded penalties and tax-related interest expense to the tax provision of $ 20.6 million, $ 69.5 million and $ 16.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company reduced its liability for penalties and income tax-related interest expense related to uncertain tax positions by $ 19.9 million due to the expiration of the statute of limitations in certain jurisdictions and certain positions that were effectively settled. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company reduced its liability for penalties and income tax-related interest expense related to uncertain tax positions by $ 14.6 million and $ 4.8 million, respectively, due to the expiration F-41 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) of the statute of limitations in certain jurisdictions and certain positions that were effectively settled. In addition, as a result of a settlement in the United States, $ 45.8 million was reclassified to Accrued income tax payable as of December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the total amount of accrued income tax-related interest and penalties included in the consolidated balance sheets were $ 43.3 million and $ 42.3 million, respectively. The Company has filed for prior taxable years, and for its taxable year ended December 31, 2022 will file, numerous consolidated and separate income tax returns, including U.S. federal and state tax returns and foreign tax returns. The Company is subject to examination in the United States and various state and foreign jurisdictions for certain tax years. As a result of the Company’s ability to carryforward federal, state and foreign NOLs, the applicable tax years generally remain open to examination several years after the applicable loss carryforwards have been used or have expired. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the tax jurisdictions resulting from these examinations. The Company believes that adequate provisions have been made for income taxes for all periods through December 31, 2022. 13. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION Summary of Stock-Based Compensation Plans —The Company maintains equity incentive plans that provide for the grant of stock-based awards to its directors, officers and employees. The Company’s 2007 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended (the “2007 Plan”), provides for the grant of non-qualified and incentive stock options, as well as restricted stock units, restricted stock and other stock-based awards. Exercise prices for non-qualified and incentive stock options are not less than the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. Equity awards typically vest ratably, generally over four years for RSUs and stock options and three years for PSUs. Stock options generally expire 10 years from the date of grant. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had the ability to grant stock-based awards with respect to an aggregate of 5.2 million shares of common stock under the 2007 Plan. In connection with the CoreSite Acquisition, the Company assumed the remaining shares previously available for issuance under a plan approved by the CoreSite shareholders, which converted into 1.4 million shares of the Company’s common stock. These shares will be available for issuance under the 2007 Plan, however, will only be available for grants to certain employees and will not be available for issuance beyond the period when they would have been available under the CoreSite plan, or March 20, 2023, at which time they will no longer be available for grant. In addition, the Company maintains an employee stock purchase plan (the “ESPP”) pursuant to which eligible employees may purchase shares of the Company’s common stock on the last day of each bi-annual offering period at a 15 % discount from the lower of the closing market value on the first or last day of such offering period. The offering periods run from June 1 through November 30 and from December 1 through May 31 of each year. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded the following stock-based compensation expenses: 2022 (1) 2021 (1) 2020 (2) Stock-based compensation expense $ 169.3 $ 119.5 $ 120.8 _______________ (1) For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, stock-based compensation expense is included in selling, general, administrative and development expense.

Stock Options —There were no options granted during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. The fair values of previously granted stock options were estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model based on the assumptions at the date of grant. The intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $ 34.3 million, $ 176.7 million and $ 176.3 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, there was no unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock options.

(2) PSUs consist of the target number of shares issuable at the end of the three-year performance period for the 2021 PSUs and the 2020 PSUs (each as defined below), or 98,694 and 70,739 shares, respectively, and the shares issuable at the end of the three-year vesting period for the PSUs granted in 2019 (the “2019 PSUs”), based on achievement against the performance metrics for the three-year performance period, or 98,188 shares. (3) PSUs consist of the target number of shares issuable at the end of the three-year performance period for the 2022 PSUs, or 98,542 shares. PSUs also includes the shares above target that are issuable for the 2020 PSUs at the end of the three-year performance cycle based on exceeding the performance metric for the three-year performance period, or 8,493 shares. (4) Includes 17,121 shares of previously vested and deferred RSUs. PSUs consist of shares vested pursuant to the 2019 PSUs. There are no additional shares to be earned related to the 2019 PSU. The total fair value of RSUs and PSUs that vested during the year ended December 31, 2022 was $ 153.1 million. Restricted Stock Units— As of December 31, 2022, total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested RSUs granted under the 2007 Plan, including the CoreSite Replacement Awards, was $ 170.9 million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately two years . Vesting of RSUs is subject generally to the employee’s continued employment or death, disability or qualified retirement (each as defined in the applicable RSU award agreement). In December 2021, in connection with the CoreSite Acquisition, the Company assumed and converted certain equity awards previously F-43 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) granted by CoreSite under its equity plan into corresponding CoreSite Replacement Awards. As of December 31, 2022, total unrecognized compensation expense related to the CoreSite Replacement Awards was $ 6.5 million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately one year . Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units— During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company’s Compensation Committee (the “Compensation Committee”) granted an aggregate of 98,542 PSUs (the “2022 PSUs”) to its executive officers and established the performance metrics for these awards.

Threshold, target and maximum parameters were established for the metrics for a three-year performance period with respect to each of the 2022 PSUs, the 2021 PSUs and the 2020 PSUs and will be used to calculate the number of shares that will be issuable when each award vests, which may range from zero to 200 % of the target amounts. At the end of each three-year performance period, the number of shares that vest will depend on the degree of achievement against the pre-established performance goals. PSUs will be paid out in common stock at the end of each performance period, subject generally to the executive’s continued employment or death, disability or qualified retirement (each as defined in the applicable PSU award agreement). PSUs will accrue dividend equivalents prior to vesting, which will be paid out only in respect of shares that actually vest. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded $ 28.9 million in stock-based compensation expense for equity awards in which the performance goals have been established and were probable of being achieved. The remaining unrecognized compensation expense related to these awards at December 31, 2022 was $ 6.3 million based on the Company’s current assessment of the probability of achieving the performance goals.

OTHER OPERATING EXPENSE Other operating expense consists primarily of impairment charges, net losses on sales or disposals of assets and other operating expense items. The Company records impairment charges to write down certain assets to their net realizable value after an indicator of impairment is identified and subsequent analysis determines that the asset is either partially recoverable or not recoverable. These assets consist primarily of those related to the Company’s tower locations, and included towers and related assets included in property and equipment, network location intangible assets and right-of-use assets, all of which are typically assessed on an individual location or site basis. The assets subject to impairment also include tenant-related intangibles, which are assessed on a tenant basis. Net losses on sales or disposals of assets primarily relate to certain non-core towers, other assets and miscellaneous items. Other operating expenses includes acquisition-related costs and integration costs. Other operating expenses included the following for the years ended December 31,: 2022 2021 2020 Impairment charges (1) $ 655.9 $ 173.7 $ 222.8 Net losses on sales or disposals of assets 28.4 22.7 17.3 Other operating expenses (2) 83.3 202.3 25.7 Total Other operating expenses $ 767.6 $ 398.7 $ 265.8 _______________ (1) For the year ended December 31, 2022, impairment charges primarily relate to India, as discussed below.

India Impairments The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment annually (as of December 31) or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an assets may not be recoverable, as further discussed in note 1. In the third quarter of 2022, the Company’s largest customer in India, Vodafone Idea Limited (“VIL”), communicated that it would make partial payments of its contractual amounts owed to the Company and indicated that it would continue to make partial payments for the remainder of 2022. In late 2022, VIL had communicated its intent to resume payments in full under its contractual obligations owed to the Company beginning on January 1, 2023. However, in early 2023, VIL communicated that it would not be able to resume payments in full of its contractual obligations owed to the Company, and that it would instead continue to make partial payments. The Company considered these recent developments and the uncertainty with respect to amounts owed under its tenant leases when conducting its annual impairment assessments for long-lived assets in India. A probability weighted assessment was performed, incorporating current and expected industry and market conditions and trends and, as a result, the Company determined that certain fixed and intangible assets had been impaired during the year ended December 31, 2022. • An impairment of $ 97.0 million was taken on tower and network location intangible assets in India. • The Company also impaired the tenant-related intangible assets for VIL, which resulted in an impairment of $ 411.6 million.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Litigation —The Company periodically becomes involved in various claims, lawsuits and proceedings that are incidental to its business. In the opinion of Company management, after consultation with counsel, there are no matters currently pending that would, in the event of an adverse outcome, materially impact the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Verizon Transaction —In March 2015, the Company entered into an agreement with various operating entities of Verizon Communications Inc. (“Verizon”) that currently provides for the lease, sublease or management of approximately 11,250 wireless communications sites commencing March 27, 2015. The average term of the lease or sublease for all communications sites at the inception of the agreement was approximately 28 years, assuming renewals or extensions of the underlying ground leases for the sites. The Company has the option to purchase the leased sites in tranches, subject to the applicable lease, sublease or management rights upon its scheduled expiration. Each tower is assigned to an annual tranche, ranging from 2034 to 2047, which represents the outside expiration date for the sublease rights to the towers in that tranche. The purchase price for each tranche is a fixed amount stated in the lease for such tranche plus the fair market value of certain alterations made to the related towers. The aggregate purchase option price for the towers leased and subleased is approximately $ 5.0 billion. Verizon will occupy the sites as a tenant for an initial term of ten years with eight optional successive five-year terms; each such term shall be governed by standard master lease agreement terms established as a part of the transaction. AT&T Transaction —The Company has an agreement with SBC Communications Inc., a predecessor entity to AT&T Inc. (“AT&T”), that currently provides for the lease or sublease of approximately 1,900 towers commencing between December 2000 and August 2004. Substantially all of the towers are part of the Trust Securitizations. The average term of the lease or sublease for all sites at the inception of the agreement was approximately 27 years, assuming renewals or extensions of the underlying ground leases for the sites. The Company has the option to purchase the sites subject to the applicable lease or sublease upon its expiration. Each tower is assigned to an annual tranche, ranging from 2013 to 2032, which represents the outside expiration date for the sublease rights to that tower. The purchase price for each site is a fixed amount stated in the lease for that site plus the fair market value of certain alterations made to the related tower by AT&T. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has purchased an aggregate of more than 500 of the subleased towers which are subject to the applicable agreement, including 143 towers purchased during the year ended December 31, 2022 for an aggregate purchase price of $ 93.2 million. The aggregate purchase option price for the remaining towers leased and subleased is $ 1.0 billion and includes per annum accretion through the applicable expiration of the lease or sublease of a site. For all such sites, AT&T has the right to continue to lease the reserved space through June 30, 2025 at the then-current monthly fee, which shall escalate in accordance with the standard master lease agreement for the remainder of AT&T’s tenancy. Thereafter, AT&T shall have the right to renew such lease for up to five successive five-year terms. F-49 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) Other Contingencies —The Company is subject to income tax and other taxes in the geographic areas where it holds assets or operates, and periodically receives notifications of audits, assessments or other actions by taxing authorities. Taxing authorities may issue notices or assessments while audits are being conducted. In certain jurisdictions, taxing authorities may issue assessments with minimal examination. These notices and assessments do not represent amounts that the Company is obligated to pay and are often not reflective of the actual tax liability for which the Company will ultimately be liable. In the process of responding to assessments of taxes that the Company believes are not enforceable, the Company avails itself of both administrative and judicial remedies. The Company evaluates the circumstances of each notification or assessment based on the information available and, in those instances in which the Company does not anticipate a successful defense of positions taken in its tax filings, a liability is recorded in the appropriate amount based on the underlying assessment. Guaranties and Indemnifications —The Company enters into agreements from time to time in the ordinary course of business pursuant to which it agrees to guarantee or indemnify third parties for certain claims. The Company has also entered into purchase and sale agreements relating to the sale or acquisition of assets containing customary indemnification provisions. The Company’s indemnification obligations under these agreements generally are limited solely to damages resulting from breaches of representations and warranties or covenants under the applicable agreements. In addition, payments under such indemnification clauses are generally conditioned on the other party making a claim that is subject to whatever defenses the Company may have and are governed by dispute resolution procedures specified in the particular agreement. Further, the Company’s obligations under these agreements may be limited in duration and amount, and in some instances, the Company may have recourse against third parties for payments made by the Company. The Company has not historically made any material payments under these agreements and, as of December 31, 2022, is not aware of any agreements that could result in a material payment. 19.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS Property Communications Sites and Related Communications Infrastructure —The Company’s primary business is leasing space on multitenant communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, wireless data providers, government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries. The Company has historically reported these operations on a geographic basis. Data Centers —The Company’s Data Centers segment relates to data center facilities and related assets that the Company owns and operates in the United States. The Data Centers segment offers different services from, and requires different resources, skill sets and marketing strategies than the existing property operating segment in the U.S. & Canada. As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s property operations consisted of the following: • U.S. & Canada: property operations in Canada and the United States; F-50 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) • Asia-Pacific: property operations in Australia, Bangladesh, India, New Zealand and the Philippines; • Africa: property operations in Burkina Faso, Ghana, Kenya, Niger, Nigeria, South Africa and Uganda; • Europe: property operations in France, Germany, Poland and Spain; • Latin America: property operations in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico, Paraguay and Peru; and • Data Centers: data center property operations in the United States. Services —The Company’s Services segment offers tower-related services in the United States, including AZP, structural analysis and construction management, which primarily support its site leasing business, including the addition of new tenants and equipment on its communications sites. The Services segment is a strategic business unit that offers different services from, and requires different resources, skill sets and marketing strategies than, the property operating segments. The accounting policies applied in compiling segment information below are similar to those described in note 1. Among other factors, in evaluating financial performance in each business segment, management uses segment gross margin and segment operating profit. The Company defines segment gross margin as segment revenue less segment operating expenses excluding Depreciation, amortization and accretion; Selling, general, administrative and development expense; and Other operating expenses. The Company defines segment operating profit as segment gross margin less Selling, general, administrative and development expense attributable to the segment, excluding stock-based compensation expense and corporate expenses. These measures of segment gross margin and segment operating profit are also before Interest income, Interest expense, Gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations, Other income (expense), Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and Income tax benefit (provision). The categories of expenses indicated above, such as depreciation, have been excluded from segment operating performance as they are not considered in the review of information or the evaluation of results by management. There are no significant revenues resulting from transactions between the Company’s operating segments. All intercompany transactions are eliminated to reconcile segment results and assets to the consolidated statements of operations and consolidated balance sheets. Summarized financial information concerning the Company’s reportable segments for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 is shown in the following tables. The “Other” column (i) represents amounts excluded from specific segments, such as business development operations, stock-based compensation expense and corporate expenses included in Selling, general, administrative and development expense; Other operating expenses; Interest income; Interest expense; Gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations; and Other income (expense), and (ii) reconciles segment operating profit to Income from continuing operations before income taxes.

We have based those forward-looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future results. When we use words such as “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects” or similar expressions, we are making forward-looking statements. Examples of forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, future prospects of growth in the communications infrastructure leasing industry, the effects of consolidation among companies in our industry and among our customers and other competitive and financial pressures, our ability to maintain or increase our market share, our plans to fund our future liquidity needs, our substantial leverage and debt service obligations, our future financing transactions, our future operating results, the level of future expenditures by companies in this industry and other trends in this industry, changes in zoning, tax and other laws and regulations and administrative and judicial decisions, economic, political and other events, particularly those relating to our international operations, our future capital expenditure levels, our expectations regarding the impacts of the coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic and actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and our operating results, the expected impact of the CoreSite Acquisition (as defined in this Annual Report) on our business, including our ability to successfully integrate the CoreSite assets or utilize such assets to their full capacity, the impact of technology changes on our industry and our business, our ability to remain qualified for taxation as a real estate investment trust (REIT), the amount and timing of any future distributions including those we are required to make as a REIT, natural disasters and similar events, technology failures, including cybersecurity and data privacy incidents, and our ability to protect our rights to the land under our towers and buildings in which our data centers are located. These statements are based on our management’s beliefs and assumptions, which in turn are based on currently available information. These assumptions could prove inaccurate. These forward-looking statements may be found under the captions “Business” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” as well as in this Annual Report generally. You should keep in mind that any forward-looking statement we make in this Annual Report or elsewhere speaks only as of the date on which we make it. New risks and uncertainties arise from time to time, and it is impossible for us to predict these events or how they may affect us. In any event, these and other important factors, including those set forth in Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption “Risk Factors,” may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by our forward-looking statements. We have no duty, and do not intend, to update or revise the forward-looking statements we make in this Annual Report, except as may be required by law. In light of these risks and uncertainties, you should keep in mind that the future events or circumstances described in any forward-looking statement we make in this Annual Report or elsewhere might not occur.

BUSINESS Overview We are one of the largest global real estate investment trusts and a leading independent owner, operator and developer of multitenant communications real estate. Our primary business is the leasing of space on communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, wireless data providers, government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries. We refer to this business as our property operations, which accounted for 97% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021. We also offer tower-related services in the United States, which we refer to as our services operations. These services include site application, zoning and permitting and structural analysis, which primarily support our site leasing business, including the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites. Our customers include our tenants, licensees and other payers. Since inception, we have grown our communications real estate portfolio through acquisitions, long-term lease arrangements and site development. Our portfolio primarily consists of towers that we own and towers that we operate pursuant to long-term lease arrangements, as well as distributed antenna system (“DAS”) networks, which provide seamless coverage solutions in certain in-building and outdoor wireless environments. In addition to the communications sites in our portfolio, we manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements. We also hold other telecommunications infrastructure, fiber and property interests that we lease primarily to communications service providers and third-party tower operators, and, as discussed further below, we hold a portfolio of highly interconnected data center facilities and related assets in the United States that we lease primarily to enterprises, network operators, cloud providers and supporting service providers. In 2021, we added approximately 31,000 communications sites to our portfolios in Latin America and Europe and launched operations in Spain as part of our transaction with Telxius Telecom, S.A. (“Telxius,” and the acquisition, the “Telxius Acquisition,” as further discussed in Item 7 of this Annual Report under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Executive Overview”). In addition, we launched operations in the Philippines through the construction of new sites therein and in Bangladesh through the acquisition of a controlling interest in Kirtonkhola Tower Bangladesh Limited (the “Bangladesh Acquisition”). As of December 31, 2021, our communications real estate portfolio of 220,131 communications sites included 43,308 communications sites in the U.S. & Canada, 75,725 communications sites in Asia-Pacific, 22,165 communications sites in Africa, 30,041 communications sites in Europe and 48,892 communications sites in Latin America, as well as urban telecommunications assets, including fiber, in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, India, Mexico and South Africa and other property interests in Australia, Canada and the United States. In December 2021, we completed the acquisition of CoreSite Realty Corporation (“CoreSite”), consisting of over 20 data center facilities and related assets in eight United States markets, for total consideration of $10.4 billion, including the assumption and repayment of CoreSite’s existing debt (the “CoreSite Acquisition”). As of December 31, 2021, our data center portfolio consisted of 27 data center facilities across ten United States markets, including the assets acquired as part of the CoreSite Acquisition, as well as our previously acquired data center facilities. In May 2021 and June 2021, in connection with the funding of the Telxius Acquisition, we entered into agreements with Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (“CDPQ”) and Allianz insurance companies and funds managed by Allianz Capital Partners GmbH, including the Allianz European Infrastructure Fund (collectively, “Allianz”), for CDPQ and Allianz to acquire 30% and 18% noncontrolling interests, respectively, in subsidiaries whose holdings consist of our operations in France, Germany, Poland and Spain (such subsidiaries collectively, “ATC Europe,” and the transactions, the “ATC Europe Transactions”). We completed the ATC Europe Transactions in September 2021 for total aggregate consideration of 2.6 billion Euros (“EUR”) (approximately $3.1 billion at the date of closing). After the completion of the ATC Europe Transactions, we hold a 52% controlling ownership interest in ATC Europe. We operate as a real estate investment trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes (“REIT”). Accordingly, we generally are not required to pay U.S. federal income taxes on income generated by our REIT operations, including the income derived from leasing space on our towers and in our data centers, as we receive a dividends paid deduction for distributions to stockholders that generally offsets our REIT income and gains. However, we remain obligated to pay U.S. federal income taxes on earnings from our domestic taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRSs”). In addition, our international assets and operations, regardless of their classification for U.S. tax purposes, continue to be subject to taxation in the jurisdictions where those assets are held or those operations are conducted. The use of TRSs enables us to continue to engage in certain businesses and jurisdictions while complying with REIT qualification requirements. We may, from time to time, change the election of previously designated TRSs to be included as part of the REIT. As of December 31, 2021, our REIT-qualified businesses included our U.S. tower leasing business, a majority of our U.S. indoor DAS networks business, our Services and Data Centers segments, as well as most of our operations in 1 Table of Conten ts Canada, Costa Rica, France, Germany, Mexico and Nigeria. In January 2022, a majority of our operations in Ghana, Kenya, South Africa and Uganda became part of the REIT. During the fourth quarter of 2021, as a result of the CoreSite Acquisition, we updated our reportable segments to add a Data Centers segment. The Data Centers segment is included within our property operations. We will now report our results in seven segments – U.S. & Canada property (which includes all assets in the United States and Canada, other than our data center facilities and related assets), Asia-Pacific property, Africa property, Europe property, Latin America property, Data Centers and Services. We believe this change provides greater visibility into our operating segments and aligns our reporting with management’s current approach of allocating costs and resources, managing growth and profitability and assessing the operating performance of our business segments. This change applies to our business operations results beginning with the fourth quarter of 2021 and had no impact on our consolidated financial statements for any prior periods. Historical financial information included in this Annual Report has not been adjusted as the amounts attributable to data center assets were insignificant as prior to the fourth quarter of 2021, we owned one data center. Products and Services Property Operations Our property operations accounted for 97%, 99% and 98% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our revenue is primarily generated from tenant leases. Our tenants lease space on our communications real estate, where they install and maintain their equipment. Rental payments vary considerably depending upon numerous factors, including, but not limited to, amount, type and position of tenant equipment on the tower, remaining tower capacity and tower location. Our costs typically include ground rent (which is primarily fixed under long-term lease agreements with annual cost escalations) and power and fuel costs, some or all of which may be passed through to our tenants, as well as property taxes and repair and maintenance expenses. Our property operations have generated consistent growth in revenue and typically have low cash flow volatility due to the following characteristics: • Long-term tenant leases with contractual rent escalations. In general, our tenant leases for our communications sites with wireless carriers have initial non-cancellable terms of five to ten years with multiple renewal terms, with provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease, typically annually, based on a fixed escalation percentage (averaging approximately 3% in the United States) or an inflationary index in most of our international markets, or a combination of both. Based upon foreign currency exchange rates and the tenant leases in place as of December 31, 2021, we expect to generate over $61 billion of non-cancellable tenant lease revenue over future periods, before the impact of straight-line lease accounting. • Consistent demand for our sites. As a result of rapidly growing usage of mobile data and other wireless services and the corresponding wireless industry capital spending trends in the markets we serve, we anticipate consistent demand for our communications sites. We believe that our global asset base positions us well to benefit from the increasing proliferation of advanced wireless devices and the increasing usage of high bandwidth applications on those devices. We have the ability to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our sites, which typically results in incremental revenue and modest incremental costs. Our site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with a solid platform for new business opportunities, which has historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth. • High lease renewal rates. Our tenants tend to renew leases because suitable alternative sites may not exist or be available and repositioning a site in their network may be expensive and may adversely affect network quality. Historically, churn has averaged approximately 1% to 2% of tenant billings per year. We define churn as tenant billings lost when a tenant cancels or does not renew its lease or, in limited circumstances, when the lease rates on existing leases are reduced. We derive our churn rate for a given year by dividing our tenant billings lost on this basis by our prior-year tenant billings. As discussed in Item 7 of this Annual Report under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Executive Overview,” we experienced elevated levels of churn in recent years due to carrier consolidation-driven churn in India. We anticipate that our churn rate in our Asia-Pacific property segment will moderate over time, however, in the immediate term, we believe that our churn rate may remain elevated as, among other things, our tenants in India evaluate how best to comply with the recent court rulings by the Supreme Court of India and determine their obligations under payment plans for the adjusted gross revenue (“AGR”) fees and charges prescribed by such court, as further discussed in Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption “Risk Factors—Our business, and that of our customers, is subject to laws, regulations and administrative and judicial decisions, and changes thereto, that could restrict our ability to operate our business as we currently do or impact our competitive landscape.” Additionally, we expect that our churn rate in our U.S. & Canada property segment will be elevated for a period of several years due to contractual lease cancellations 2 Table of Conten ts and non-renewals pursuant to the terms of our master lease agreement with T-Mobile US, Inc. (“T-Mobile,” and the agreement, the “T-Mobile MLA”) entered into in September 2020. • High operating margins. Incremental operating costs associated with adding new tenants or equipment to an existing communications site are relatively minimal. Therefore, as tenants or equipment are added, the substantial majority of incremental revenue flows through to gross margin and operating profit. In addition, in many of our international markets, certain expenses, such as ground rent or power and fuel costs, are reimbursed or shared by our tenant base. • Low maintenance capital expenditures. On average, we require relatively low amounts of annual capital expenditures to maintain our communications sites. Our property business includes the operation of communications sites and managed networks, the leasing of property interests and, in select markets, the operation of fiber, the operation of data centers and the provision of backup power through shared generators. Our presence in a number of markets at different relative stages of wireless development provides us with significant diversification and long-term growth potential. Our property segments accounted for the following percentage of consolidated total revenue for the years ended December 31,: 2021 2020 2019 U.S. & Canada 52 % 56 % 55 % Asia-Pacific 13 % 14 % 16 % Africa 11 % 11 % 8 % Europe 5 % 2 % 2 % Latin America 16 % 16 % 18 % Data Centers 0 % — % — % Communications Sites. Approximately 95% of revenue in our property segments was attributable to our communications sites, excluding DAS networks, for each of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. We lease space on our communications sites to tenants providing a diverse range of communications services, including cellular voice and data, broadcasting, mobile video and a number of other applications. In addition, in many of our international markets, we receive pass-through revenue from our tenants to cover certain costs, including power and fuel costs and ground rent. Our top tenants by revenue for each property segment are as follows for the year ended December 31, 2021: • U.S. & Canada: AT&T Inc. (“AT&T”); T-Mobile; and Verizon Wireless accounted for an aggregate of 88% of U.S. & Canada property segment revenue. • Asia-Pacific: Vodafone Idea Limited; Bharti Airtel Limited (“Airtel”); and Reliance Jio accounted for an aggregate of 89% of Asia-Pacific property segment revenue. • Africa: Airtel; and MTN Group Limited (“MTN”) accounted for an aggregate of 73% of Africa property segment revenue. • Europe: Telefónica S.A. (“Telefónica”); and Bouygues accounted for an aggregate of 74% of Europe property segment revenue. • Latin America: AT&T; Telefónica; and América Móvil accounted for an aggregate of 60% of Latin America property segment revenue. Accordingly, we are subject to certain risks, as set forth in Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption “Risk Factors—A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of customers, and we are sensitive to adverse changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our customers.” In addition, we are subject to risks related to our international operations, as set forth under the caption “Risk Factors—Our foreign operations are subject to economic, political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position, including risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.” Managed Networks, Fiber and Related Assets, Data Centers and Related Assets, Property Interests and Shared Generators. In addition to our communications sites, we also own and operate several types of managed network solutions, provide communications site management services to third parties, manage and lease property interests under carrier or other third-party communications sites, provide the right to use fiber, operate data center facilities and provide back-up power sources to tenants at our sites. The balance of our property segment revenue not attributable to our communications sites was attributable to these items. • Managed Networks. We own and operate DAS networks in the United States and certain international markets. We obtain rights from property owners to install and operate in-building DAS networks, and we grant rights to wireless service providers to attach their equipment to our installations. We also offer a small portfolio of outdoor DAS networks as a complementary shared infrastructure solution for our tenants in the United States and in certain 3 Table of Conten ts international markets. Typically, we have designed, built and operated our outdoor DAS networks in areas in which zoning restrictions or other barriers may prevent or delay deployment of more traditional wireless communications sites, such as macro tower sites. We also hold lease rights and easement interests on rooftops capable of hosting communications equipment in locations where towers are generally not a viable solution based on area characteristics. In addition, we provide management services to property owners in the United States who elect to retain full rights to their property while simultaneously marketing the rooftop for wireless communications equipment installation. As the demand for advanced wireless services in urban markets evolves, we continue to evaluate a variety of infrastructure solutions, including small cells and other network architectures that may support our tenants’ networks in these areas. • Fiber and Related Assets. We own and operate fiber and related assets in certain international markets. We currently provide the right to use such fiber and related assets to communications and internet service providers and third-party operators to support their telecommunications infrastructure. We expect to continue to evaluate opportunities to invest selectively in and expand these and other similar assets in the future as part of advanced network deployments. • Data Centers and Related Assets. As a result of our recent data center acquisitions, we own and operate data center facilities and related assets in the United States, which consist of specialized and secure buildings that house networking, storage and communications technology infrastructure, including servers, storage devices, switches, routers and fiber optic transmission equipment. These buildings are designed to provide the power, cooling and network connectivity necessary to efficiently operate this equipment. Data centers located at points where many communications networks converge can also function as interconnection hubs where customers are able to connect to multiple networks, cloud companies and other service providers to exchange traffic and interoperate with each other. • Property Interests . We own portfolios of property interests in Australia, Canada and the United States, including land under carrier or other third-party communications sites, which provide recurring cash flow under complementary leasing arrangements. • Shared Generators . We have contracts with certain of our tenants in the United States pursuant to which we provide access to shared backup power generators. Services Operations We offer tower-related services in the United States, including site application, zoning and permitting and structural analysis services. Our services operations primarily support our site leasing business, including through the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites. This segment accounted for 3%, 1% and 2% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Site Application, Zoning and Permitting . We engage in site application services on our own behalf in connection with our tower development projects, as well as on behalf of our tenants. We typically work with our tenants’ engineers to determine the geographic areas where new communications sites will best address the tenants’ needs and meet their coverage objectives. Once a new site is identified, we acquire the rights to the land or structure on which the site will be constructed, and we manage the permitting process to ensure all necessary approvals are obtained to construct and operate the communications site. Structural Analysis. We offer structural analysis services to wireless carriers in connection with the installation of their communications equipment on our towers. Our team of engineers can evaluate whether a tower structure can support the additional burden of the new equipment or if an upgrade is needed, which enables our tenants to better assess potential sites before making an installation decision. Our structural analysis capabilities enable us to provide higher quality service to our existing tenants by, among other things, reducing the time required to achieve on-air readiness, while also providing opportunities to offer structural analysis services to third parties. Strategy Operational Strategy As the use of wireless services on handsets, tablets and other advanced mobile devices grows and evolves, there is a corresponding increase in demand for the communications infrastructure required to deploy current and future generations of wireless communications technologies. To capture this demand, our primary operational focus is to (i) increase the occupancy of our existing communications real estate portfolio to support global connectivity, (ii) invest in and selectively grow our communications real estate portfolio, (iii) further improve our operational performance and efficiency, including through platform expansion initiatives, and (iv) maintain a strong balance sheet. We believe these efforts to meet our customers’ needs will support and enhance our ability to capitalize on the growth in demand for wireless infrastructure. In addition, we expect to explore new opportunities to enhance or extend our shared communications infrastructure businesses, including those that may make our assets incrementally more attractive to new customers, or to existing customers for new uses, and those that increase our operational efficiency. 4 Table of Conten ts • Increase the occupancy of our existing communications real estate portfolio to support global connectivity. We believe that our highest incremental returns will be achieved by leasing additional space on our existing communications sites. Increasing demand for wireless services in our served markets has resulted in significant capital spending by major wireless carriers and other connectivity providers. As a result, we anticipate growing demand for our communications sites because they are attractively located and typically have capacity available for additional tenants and equipment. In the United States, incremental carrier network activity is being driven by 4G network densification initiatives as well as the early stages of multiple concurrent 5G network deployments. In our international markets, carriers are increasingly deploying more advanced network technologies such as 4G and, in the case of our international markets with more mature network technology, 5G, while continuing to selectively augment legacy networks. We believe that the majority of our towers have capacity for additional tenants and that substantially all of our towers that are currently at or near full structural capacity can be upgraded or augmented to meet future tenant demand with relatively modest capital investment. Therefore, we will continue to target our sales and marketing activities to increase the utilization and return on investment of our existing communications sites. • Invest in and selectively grow our communications real estate portfolio to meet our customers’ needs. We seek opportunities to invest in and grow our operations through our capital expenditure program and acquisitions. A significant portion of our inorganic growth has been focused on properties with lower initial tenancy because we believe that over time we can significantly increase tenancy levels, and therefore, drive strong returns on those assets. More recently, we have invested in strategic data center assets, including through the CoreSite Acquisition, which we believe can drive strong, recurring growth and also meaningfully enhance the value of our existing communications tower real estate through emerging edge compute opportunities in the future. • Further improve our operational performance and efficiency. We continue to seek opportunities to improve our operational performance throughout the organization. This includes investing in our systems and people as we strive to improve efficiency and provide superior service to our customers. To achieve this, we intend to continue to focus on customer service initiatives, such as reducing cycle times for key functions, including lease processing and tower structural analysis. We are also focused on developing and implementing renewable power solutions across our footprint to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and help improve the overall efficiency of the communications infrastructure and wireless industries through our sustainability and platform expansion initiatives. We also expect to explore additional ways to use our platform expansion initiatives to enhance the efficiency of our operations over time. • Maintain a strong balance sheet. We remain committed to disciplined financial policies, which we believe result in our ability to maintain a strong balance sheet and will support our overall strategy and focus on asset growth and operational excellence. As a result of these policies, we currently have investment grade credit ratings. We continue to focus on maintaining a robust liquidity position and, as of December 31, 2021, had $6.1 billion of available liquidity. We believe that our investment grade credit ratings provide us consistent access to the capital markets and our liquidity provides us the ability to continue to invest in growing and augmenting our business. Capital Allocation Strategy The objective of our capital allocation strategy is to simultaneously increase adjusted funds from operations per share and our return on invested capital over the long term. To maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT, we are required annually to distribute an amount equal to at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain) to our stockholders. After complying with our REIT distribution requirements, we plan to continue to allocate our available capital among investment alternatives that meet or exceed our return on investment criteria, while taking into account the repayment of debt consistent with our financial policies. • Capital expenditure program. We expect to continue to invest in and expand our existing communications real estate portfolio through our capital expenditure program. This includes capital expenditures associated with site maintenance, increasing the capacity of our existing sites and projects such as new site and data center facility construction, land interest acquisitions and power solutions. • Acquisitions. We intend to continue to pursue acquisitions of communications sites and other telecommunications infrastructure in our existing or new markets where we can meet or exceed our risk-adjusted return on investment criteria. The risk-adjusted hurdle rates used to evaluate acquisition opportunities consider additional factors such as the country and counterparties involved, investment and economic climate, legal and regulatory conditions and industry risk, among others. • Return excess capital to stockholders . If we have excess capital available after funding (i) our required distributions, (ii) capital expenditures, (iii) the repayment of debt consistent with our financial policies and (iv) anticipated future investments, including acquisition and select platform expansion opportunities, we will seek to return such excess capital to stockholders, including through our stock repurchase programs. 5 Table of Conten ts International Growth Strategy We believe that, in certain international markets, we can create substantial value by either establishing a new, or expanding our existing, communications real estate leasing business. Therefore, we expect we will continue to seek international growth opportunities where we believe our risk-adjusted return objectives can be achieved. We strive to maintain a diversified approach to our international growth strategy by operating in a geographically diverse array of markets in a variety of stages of wireless network development. Our international growth strategy includes a disciplined, individualized market evaluation, in which we conduct the following analyses, among others: • Country analysis. Prior to entering a new market, we conduct an extensive review of the country’s historical and projected macroeconomic fundamentals, including inflation and foreign currency exchange rate trends, demographics, capital markets, tax regime and investment alternatives, and the general business, political and legal environments, including property rights and regulatory regime. • Wireless industry analysis. To confirm the presence of sufficient demand to support an independent tower leasing model, we analyze the competitiveness of the country’s wireless market. This includes an evaluation of the industry’s pricing environment, past and potential consolidation and the stage of its wireless network development. Characteristics that result in an attractive investment opportunity include (i) multiple competitive wireless service providers who are actively seeking to invest in deploying voice and data networks and (ii) ongoing or expected deployment of incremental spectrum from recent or anticipated auctions. • Opportunity and counterparty analysis. Once an investment opportunity is identified within a geographic area with an attractive wireless industry, we conduct a multifaceted opportunity and counterparty analysis. This includes evaluating (i) the type of transaction, (ii) its ability to meet our risk-adjusted return criteria given the country and the counterparties involved, including the anticipated anchor tenant and (iii) how the transaction fits within our long-term strategic objectives, including future potential investment and expansion within the region. Regulatory Matters Towers, Antennas and Fiber. Our U.S. and international tower leasing businesses are subject to national, state and local regulatory requirements with respect to the registration, siting, construction, lighting, marking and maintenance of our towers. In the United States, the construction of new towers or modifications to existing towers may require pre-approval by the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) and the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”), depending on factors such as tower height and proximity to public airfields. Towers requiring pre-approval must be registered with the FCC and maintained in accordance with FAA standards. Similar requirements regarding pre-approval of the construction and modification of towers are imposed by regulators in other countries. Non-compliance with applicable tower-related requirements may lead to monetary penalties or site deconstruction orders. Certain of our international operations are subject to regulatory requirements with respect to licensing, registration, permitting and public listings. In India, our subsidiary, ATC Telecom Infrastructure Private Limited (“ATC TIPL”), holds an Infrastructure Provider Category-I (“IP-I”) Registration Certificate issued by the Indian Ministry of Communications and Information Technology, which permits us to provide tower space to companies licensed as telecommunications service providers under the Indian Telegraph Act of 1885. As a condition to the IP-I, the Indian government has the right to take over telecommunications infrastructure in the case of emergency or war. Additionally, in 2018, ATC TIPL issued non-convertible debentures, which are listed on the National Stock Exchange of India. Although the debt is held by another subsidiary of ours and is eliminated in consolidation, ATC TIPL is still subject to the listing requirements of such exchange. In Asia-Pacific, our subsidiaries in the Philippines and Bangladesh are required to hold a registration or license in order to establish, manage and operate passive telecommunications infrastructure services. In Africa, our subsidiaries in Burkina Faso, Ghana, Kenya, Niger, Nigeria and Uganda are required to hold a license in order to establish and maintain passive telecommunications infrastructure services and DAS networks for communications service providers. Additionally, in Uganda, our subsidiary is subject to review for three years commencing in 2020 by a monitoring trustee regarding compliance with certain conditions of approval of our acquisition in 2019 of Eaton Towers Holdings Limited. In Latin America, our subsidiary in Chile holds a license for the provision of passive telecommunications infrastructure and our subsidiary in Argentina holds a license for the leasing of fiber. The subsidiaries that hold our fiber business in Mexico and Brazil are also licensed and regulated as concession holders and permit holders authorized to provide telecommunications services. In many of the markets in which we operate, we are required to provide tower space to service providers on a non-discriminatory basis, subject to the negotiation of mutually agreeable terms. Our international business operations may be subject to increased licensing fees or ownership restrictions. For example, in South Africa, the Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment Act, 2003 (the “BBBEE Act”) has established a legislative framework for the promotion of economic empowerment of South African citizens disadvantaged by Apartheid. Accordingly, 6 Table of Conten ts the BBBEE Act and related codes measure BBBEE Act compliance and good corporate practice by the inclusion of certain ownership, management control, employment equity and other metrics for companies that do business there. In Kenya, our regulator requires all holders of a commercial license to issue at least 30% of their shares to Kenyans within three years of receiving the license unless a waiver is obtained to extend such period of compliance by a year. In addition, certain municipalities have sought to impose permit fees based upon structural or operational requirements of towers and certain regional and other governmental bodies have sought to impose levies or other forms of fees. Our foreign operations may be affected if a country’s regulatory authority restricts, revokes or modifies spectrum licenses of certain wireless service providers or implements limitations on foreign ownership. In all countries where we operate, we are subject to zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by local authorities or community organizations. While these regulations vary, they typically require tower owners or tenants to obtain approval from local authorities or community standards organizations prior to tower construction or the addition of a new antenna to an existing tower. Local zoning authorities and community residents often oppose construction in their communities, which can delay or prevent new tower construction, new antenna installation or site upgrade projects, thereby limiting our ability to respond to tenant demand. This opposition and existing or new zoning regulations can increase costs associated with new tower construction, tower modifications or additions of new antennas to a site or site upgrades, as well as adversely affect the associated timing or cost of such projects. Further, additional regulations may be adopted that cause delays or result in additional costs to us or changes in the competitive landscape that may negatively affect our business. These factors could materially and adversely affect our operations. In the United States, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 prohibits any action by state and local authorities that would discriminate between different providers of wireless services or ban altogether the construction, modification or placement of communications sites. It also prohibits state or local restrictions based on the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent the facilities comply with FCC regulations. Further, in February 2012, the United States government adopted regulations requiring that local and state governments approve modifications or colocations that qualify as eligible facilities under the regulations. Portions of our business are subject to additional regulations, for example, in a number of states throughout the United States, certain of our subsidiaries hold Competitive Local Exchange Carrier (CLEC) or other status, in connection with the operation of our outdoor DAS networks business. In addition, we, or our customers, may be subject to new regulatory policies in certain jurisdictions from time to time that may materially and adversely affect our business or the demand for our communications sites. Data Centers . Our U.S. data center facilities and related assets are subject to various federal, state and local regulations, such as state and local fire and life safety regulations and Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) federal requirements. If one of our properties is not in compliance with these regulations, we may be required to make significant unanticipated expenditures in order to comply with such regulations and/or pay fines or civil damage awards. Existing regulations may subsequently change or future regulations may be enacted, either of which could have a similar impact as described above, and could materially and adversely affect our operations.

Our U.S. and international operations are subject to various national, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the management, use, storage, disposal, emission and remediation of, and exposure to, hazardous and non-hazardous substances, materials and wastes, the siting of our towers and the maintenance of our data center facilities. We may be required to obtain permits, pay additional property taxes, comply with regulatory requirements and make certain informational filings related to hazardous substances or devices used to provide power such as batteries, generators and fuel at our tower sites and/or data center facilities. With respect to our data center facilities, the presence of contamination, asbestos, mold or other air quality issues or the failure to remediate contamination, asbestos, mold or other air quality issues at our facilities may expose us to third-party liability or materially adversely affect our ability to sell, lease or develop the real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral. Violations of these types of regulations could subject us to fines or criminal sanctions. Additionally, in the United States and in other countries where we operate, before constructing a new tower or adding an antenna to an existing site, we must review and evaluate the impact of the action to determine whether it may significantly affect the environment and whether we must disclose any significant impacts in an environmental assessment. If a tower or new antenna might have a material adverse impact on the environment, FCC or other governmental approval of the tower or antenna could be significantly delayed. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, and some of the states and localities in which we operate, have also enacted certain climate change laws and regulations and/or have begun regulating carbon footprints and greenhouse gas emissions and may adopt new regulations related to the use of fossil fuels or requiring the use of alternative fuel or renewable energy sources to power energy resources that serve our data centers. Efforts to support and enhance renewable electricity generation may increase our costs of electricity above those that would be incurred through procurement of conventional 7 Table of Conten ts electricity. Our data centers require and consume significant amounts of power, including electricity generated by the burning of fossil fuels. These laws, regulations and stakeholder requests could limit our ability to develop new facilities or result in substantial compliance, maintenance, repair, retrofit and construction costs, including capital expenditures for environmental control facilities and other new equipment. Changes in regulations that affect electric power providers, such as regulations related to the control of greenhouse gas emissions or other climate change-related matters, could adversely affect the costs of electric power and increase our operating costs, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations or those of our customers. Health and Safety. In the United States and in other countries where we operate, we are subject to various national, state and local laws regarding employee health and safety, including protection from radio frequency exposure and air quality issues. Additionally, and in response to various national, state and local laws and guidance enacted in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented work-from-home arrangements and travel restrictions for our employees where practicable, as well as and other modifications to our business practices. Competition Our industry is highly competitive. We compete, both for new business and for the acquisition of assets, with other public tower companies, such as Crown Castle International Corp., SBA Communications Corporation, Telesites S.A.B. de C.V. and Cellnex Telecom, S.A., wireless carrier tower consortia such as Indus Towers Limited and private tower companies, private equity sponsored firms, carrier-affiliated tower companies, independent wireless carriers, tower owners, broadcasters and owners of non-communications sites, including rooftops, utility towers, water towers and other alternative structures. Our data center business also competes with a variety of companies offering similar data center solutions and services, including space, power, interconnection and development services. We believe that location and capacity, network and/or interconnection density, price, quality and speed of service have been, and will continue to be, significant competitive factors affecting owners, operators and managers of communications sites and data center facilities. Our services business competes with a variety of companies offering individual, or combinations of, competing services. The field of competitors includes site application consultants, zoning consultants, real estate firms, right-of-way consultants, structural engineering firms, tower owners/managers, telecommunications equipment vendors who can provide turnkey site development services through multiple subcontractors and our tenants’ personnel. We believe that our tenants base their decisions for services on various criteria, including a company’s experience, local reputation, price and time for completion of a project. For more information on demand trends in our industry, see Item 7 of this Annual Report under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Executive Overview.” Human Capital Resources As of December 31, 2021, we employed 6,378 full-time individuals, including 2,291 employees based in the United States and 4,087 employees based internationally. Our teams representing our over 20 countries around the world are our most important assets and fundamental to our success. Aligned with our business strategy, our human capital management strategy focuses on developing and delivering solutions to attract, develop, engage and retain top diverse talent in each of the countries where we operate. We consider our employee relations to be good. Our Chief Sustainability Officer regularly reports to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of our Board of Directors on our initiatives related to human capital management. Employee Engagement . In 2021, our employees completed our biennial company-wide engagement survey to provide feedback on our company in nine key areas. The survey was completed by 91% of our employees globally. All of the nine areas measured scored over 70% in favorability. Of note, teamwork and leadership both received an 89% favorability score, employee engagement received an 87% favorability score and diversity and inclusion received an 83% favorability score. Additionally, our COVID-19 response received a 91% favorability score. The questions with the highest favorable ratings were focused on our culture, values and ethics. Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. Diversity, equity and inclusion are fundamental considerations and values for us in conducting business. A critical factor in our success is ensuring that each of these remains at the core of our business culture, infusing fresh ideas, helping us remain connected to our customers in a dynamic global market and ensuring mutual respect guides us in our interactions both internally and externally. We have adopted a Global Human Rights Statement, which can be found on our website. Our Board of Directors is a diverse group with respect to traditional diversity metrics such as gender, race and national origin, as well as professional background and skills, with four members of our board identifying as female and five identifying as part of a minority group. We are also committed to ensuring diverse representation among our employees. In 2021, 38% of all 8 Table of Conten ts employees promoted globally were female, which is greater than the female representation in our workforce of 28%. And as of December 31, 2021, nearly 40% of management-level positions in the United States were also held by women. Additionally, we have implemented several initiatives designed to help address social injustice and enhance our diversity. These include pledges from the American Tower Foundation of (i) $1.0 million for grants to organizations recommended by our Social Justice Committee to counter systemic racism and (ii) $1.0 million for scholarship funds at two Historically Black Colleges and Universities. In 2021, we created a new senior role, Chief Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Officer, tasked with leading our diversity, equity and inclusion strategy by introducing new initiatives and best practices, including working with each region to develop relevant representation, development and recruitment goals and launching a company-wide resource center for our employees. Talent Development and Recruitment. As a critical investment in our capacity to provide our customers with outstanding support and customer service, we offer a variety of development opportunities unique to each market to cultivate our talent throughout our global organization. For individual contributors, we have 8,700 resources in up to five languages that focus on job-specific training and general topics, such as productivity, collaboration and project management. We create and customize courses to meet regional needs and update these courses regularly to address changing marketplace dynamics and employee interests. Developing our managers is critical to our success, and over 30,000 resources and tools are provided to all levels of management. For example, the Management Development at American Tower program provides continuous development opportunities through training led by American Tower leaders. Managers learn tools and best practices that enable both management and team success, and that build and strengthen competencies to better respond to the needs of a growing and increasingly complex organization. Our annual Advanced Leadership Development Program, in collaboration with the INSEAD executive education program, provides our next generation leaders in Latin America, Europe and Africa with a twelve-week intensive workshop to enhance management and leadership skills. The Leadership Excellence at American Tower Program supports global senior leaders’ development through its partnership with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Participants learn from leading experts on topics like global strategy and leading in uncertain times. We also have a comprehensive talent-management review process to develop future leaders and ensure effective succession planning. Our recruiting efforts consistently include strategies to build diverse candidate pipelines and promote a culture that supports a diverse team of global employees. We are proud of our Leadership Development Program, which provides a recruitment opportunity for business school students, who are able to learn about different aspects of our business through regular rotational assignments. Further, with respect to our Leadership Development Program, as of December 31, 2021, 67% of our hires identified as part of a minority group and 33% identified as female. We have also increased our recruiting efforts with Historically Black Colleges and Universities as well as other recruiting efforts to build a diverse talent pipeline. Workplace Safety. We are committed to the safety of our employees and surrounding communities. Depending on the role, team members are required to pass and complete regular safety training courses and follow specific tower and site safety protocols using complex operational manuals. A key component of our culture is a strong commitment to incident reporting and corrective actions, as well as a comprehensive program for ensuring vendor compliance with safety standards and certifications. Our strict adherence to the rigorous standards set forth by the relevant government agencies and other authorities, such as the Telecommunications Infrastructure Registered Apprenticeship Program and Telecommunications Industry Association, is critical to ensuring our towers are structurally safe for field personnel, vendors, customers and communities. In 2021, we created a new senior role, Chief Security Officer, tasked with helping to ensure the safety and security of our employees globally, as well as implementing best in class security protocols. Health and Wellness. We offer medical and parental leave benefits to full-time employees across all markets, with some local variation. As a result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we conduct wellness check-ins and offer resources to support our employees’ mental health and well-being, including access to a free Employee Assistance Program, which offers confidential assistance on a wide range of issues. We also offer market competitive benefits in all locations and, in 2021, introduced a behavioral health benefit in the United States to support employees’ mental well-being.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Risks Related to Our Business Strategy A significant decrease in leasing demand for our communications infrastructure would materially and adversely affect our business and operating results, and we cannot control that demand. A significant reduction in leasing demand for our communications infrastructure would materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. Factors that may affect such demand include: • increased mergers, consolidations or exits that reduce the number of communications service providers or increased use of network sharing among governments or communications service providers; • the financial condition of communications service providers, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic; • zoning, environmental, health, tax or other government regulations or changes in the application and enforcement thereof; • governmental licensing of spectrum or restriction or revocation of our customers’ spectrum licenses; • a decrease in demand for wireless or colocation services, including due to general economic conditions, disruption in the financial and credit markets or global social, political or health crises, such as the material adverse effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and markets; • the ability and willingness of wireless and cloud service providers to maintain or increase capital expenditures on network infrastructure; • delays or changes in the deployment of next generation wireless technologies; and • technological changes. If our customers consolidate their operations, exit their businesses or share site infrastructure to a significant degree, our growth, revenue and ability to generate positive cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Significant consolidation among our customers could reduce demand for our communications infrastructure and may materially and adversely affect our growth and revenues. Certain combined companies have rationalized duplicative parts of their networks or modernized their networks, and these and other customers could determine not to renew, or attempt to cancel, avoid or limit leases or related payments with us. In the event a customer terminates its business or separately sells its spectrum, we may experience increased churn as a result. Our ongoing contractual revenues and our future results may be negatively impacted if a significant number of these leases are terminated or not renewed. For example, see our discussion of carrier consolidation-driven churn in our Asia-Pacific property segment and churn as a result of the T-Mobile MLA in our U.S. & Canada property segment in Item 7 of this Annual Report, under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Executive Overview.” In addition, extensive sharing of site infrastructure, roaming or resale arrangements among wireless service providers, including due to increases in advanced network technology such as 5G, as an alternative to leasing our communications sites, without compensation to us, may cause new lease activity to slow if carriers utilize shared equipment rather than deploy new equipment, or may result in the decommissioning of equipment on certain existing sites because portions of the customers’ networks may become redundant. 10 Table of Conten ts A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of customers, and we are sensitive to adverse changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our customers. A substantial portion of our total operating revenues is derived from a small number of customers. If any of these customers are unwilling or unable to perform their obligations under their agreements with us, our revenues, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected. One or more of our customers, or their parent companies, may experience financial difficulties, file for bankruptcy or reduce or terminate operations as a result of a prolonged economic downturn, economic difficulties (including those from the imposition of taxes, fees, regulations or judicial interpretations of regulations, and any associated penalties or interest, which may be substantial) or otherwise. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could materially and adversely affect our customers through disruptions of, among other things, their ability to procure their equipment through their supply chains and their ability to maintain liquidity and deploy network capital, with potential decreases in consumer spending contributing to liquidity risks. Such financial difficulties could result in uncollectible accounts receivable and an impairment of our deferred rent asset, tower asset, network location intangible asset, tenant-related intangible asset or goodwill. The loss of significant customers, or the loss of all or a portion of our anticipated lease revenues from certain customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Due to the long-term nature of our customer leases, we depend on the continued financial strength of our customers. Many communications service providers operate with substantial levels of debt. In our international operations, many of our customers are subsidiaries of global telecommunications companies. These subsidiaries may not have the explicit or implied financial support of their parent entities. In addition, many of our customers and potential customers rely on capital raising activities to fund their operations and capital expenditures, which may be more difficult or expensive in the event of downturns in the economy or disruptions in the financial and credit markets, such as the current environment driven by the significant disruptions caused by factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation, rising interest rates and supply chain disruptions. If our customers or potential customers are unable to raise adequate capital to fund their business plans or face capital constraints, they may reduce their spending, file for bankruptcy or reduce or terminate operations, which could materially and adversely affect demand for our communications infrastructure and our services business. In the ordinary course of our business, we do occasionally experience disputes with our customers, generally regarding the interpretation of terms in our leases. Historically, we have resolved these disputes in a manner that did not have a material adverse effect on us or our relationships with our customers. However, it is possible that such disputes could lead to a termination of our leases with those customers, a material adverse modification of the terms of those leases or a deterioration in our relationships with those customers that leads to a failure to obtain new business from them, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. If we are forced to resolve any of these disputes through litigation, our relationship with the applicable customer could be terminated or damaged, which could lead to decreased revenue or increased costs, resulting in a corresponding adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Increasing competition within our industry may materially and adversely affect our revenue. Our industry is highly competitive and our customers have numerous alternatives in leasing communications infrastructure assets. Competition due to pricing or alternative contractual arrangements from peers could materially and adversely affect our lease rates. We may not be able to renew existing customer leases or enter into new customer leases, or if we are able to renew or enter into new leases, they may be at rates lower than our current rates or on less favorable terms than our current terms, resulting in an adverse impact on our results of operations and growth rate. Our expansion initiatives involve a number of risks and uncertainties, including those related to integrating acquired or leased assets, that could adversely affect our operating results, disrupt our operations or expose us to additional risk. As we continue to acquire and build communications sites and other communications infrastructure assets, including data center facilities and related assets, in our existing markets and expand into new markets, we are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including not meeting our return on investment criteria and financial objectives, increased costs, assumed liabilities and the diversion of managerial attention. Achieving the benefits of acquisition and platform expansion initiatives depends in part on timely and efficient integration of operations, telecommunications infrastructure assets and personnel. Integration may be difficult and unpredictable for many reasons, including, among other things, portfolios without requisite permits, differing systems, cultural differences, conflicting policies, procedures and operations. Additionally, temporary business closures, social distancing measures and the potential unavailability of key personnel or a significant number of our employees as a result of COVID-19 are difficult to predict, and may have a negative impact on the timely and efficient integration of operations, telecommunications infrastructure assets and personnel. Significant acquisition-related integration 11 Table of Conten ts costs, including certain nonrecurring charges such as costs associated with onboarding employees, integrating information technology systems, acquiring permits and visiting, inspecting, engineering and upgrading tower sites or other communications infrastructure assets, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in the period in which such charges are recorded or our cash flow in the period in which any related costs are actually paid. Some of our acquired portfolios have included sites that do not meet our structural specifications, including sites that may be overburdened. In these cases, beyond additional capital expenditures, general liability risks associated with such portfolios will exist until such time as those portfolios are upgraded or otherwise remedied. In addition, integration may significantly burden management and internal resources, including through the potential loss or unavailability of key personnel. Our international expansion initiatives are subject to additional risks, such as those described above, as well as our ability to comply with bribery and anti-corruption laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) and similar local laws. Moreover, we may fail to successfully integrate the assets we acquire or fail to utilize such assets to their full capacity. If we are not able to meet these integration challenges, we may not realize the benefits we expect from our acquired portfolios and businesses, and our business, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected. For example, failure to successfully and efficiently integrate acquired assets from the Telxius Acquisition (the “Telxius Assets”) into our operations may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Integrating acquired portfolios of the Telxius Assets may require significant resources, including increased attention from our management team. Further, the significant acquisition-related integration costs could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in the periods in which such charges are recorded or our cash flow in the periods in which any related costs are actually paid. The integration of the Telxius Assets, which includes approximately 31,000 international communications sites, into our operations continues to be a significant undertaking, and we anticipate that we will incur certain nonrecurring charges as a result. Additional integration challenges include: • transitioning all data related to the Telxius Assets, tenants and landlords to a common information technology system; • successfully transitioning the lease rent payment and the tenant billing and collection processes; and • maintaining our standards, controls, procedures and policies with respect to the Telxius Assets. As a result of our acquisitions, we have a substantial amount of intangible assets and goodwill. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”), we are required to assess our goodwill and other intangible assets annually or more frequently in the event of circumstances indicating potential impairment to determine if they are impaired. If, as a result of the factors noted above, the testing performed indicates that an asset may not be recoverable or the carrying value exceeds the fair value, we would be required to record a non-cash impairment charge in the period the determination is made. Our platform expansion initiatives may not be successful, or we may be required to record impairment charges for our goodwill or for other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition, and could limit our continued investments in such platform expansion initiatives. In addition, as we continue to invest in partnership opportunities to support our expansion initiatives, our partners may have business or economic goals that are inconsistent or conflict with ours, be in positions to take action contrary to our interests, policies or objectives, have competing interests in our, or other, markets that could create conflict of interest issues, withhold consents contrary to our requests or become unable or unwilling to fulfill their commitments, any of which could present governance challenges with multiple partners or expose us to additional liabilities or costs, including requiring us to assume and fulfill the obligations of that partnership or to execute buyouts of their interests. Failure to successfully and efficiently integrate and operate acquired data center facilities and related assets, including those acquired through the CoreSite Acquisition (the “CoreSite Assets”), into our operations may adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition. Integrating acquired data center facilities and related assets may require significant resources, including increased attention from our management team. Further, the significant acquisition-related integration costs could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in the periods in which such charges are recorded or our cash flow in the periods in which any related costs are actually paid. The integration of the CoreSite Assets, which includes over 20 data centers across eight United States metro areas, into our operations will be a significant undertaking, and we anticipate that we will incur certain nonrecurring charges as a result. Additional integration challenges include, but are not limited to: • retaining existing customers at the CoreSite Assets; • unexpected costs associated with successfully developing and expanding the CoreSite Assets; • failure to recruit or retain key personnel; • maintaining our standards, controls, procedures and policies with respect to the CoreSite Assets; and • successfully marketing space on the CoreSite Assets, which will depend on a variety of factors, including (i) the demand for data center space, (ii) Internet gateway facilities or other technology-related real estate, (iii) the presence of 12 Table of Conten ts multiple network carriers and cloud operators in our facilities, (iv) the mix of products and services offered by us, (v) the overall mix of customers, (vi) the presence of key customers attracting business through vertical market ecosystems, (vii) each data center’s operating reliability and security and (viii) our ability to effectively market and sell our services. Additionally, we may fail to successfully operate the data centers we acquire or fail to utilize such assets to their full capacity. We must safeguard our customers’ infrastructure and equipment located in our data centers and ensure our data centers remain operational at all times. Problems at one or more of our data centers, whether or not within our control, could result in service interruptions or significant infrastructure or equipment damage. These could result from numerous factors, including human error, equipment failure, physical, electronic and cyber security breaches, fire, earthquake, hurricane, flood, tornado and other natural disasters, extreme temperatures, water damage, fiber cuts, power loss, terrorist acts, sabotage and vandalism, global pandemics or health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and failure of business partners. We have service level commitment obligations to certain customers. As a result, service interruptions or significant equipment damage in our data centers could result in difficulty maintaining service level commitments to these customers and potential claims related to such failures. Because our data centers are critical to many of our customers’ businesses, service interruptions or significant equipment damage in our data centers could also result in lost profits or other indirect or consequential damages to our customers. In addition, any loss of service, equipment damage or inability to meet our service level commitment obligations could reduce the confidence of our customers and could consequently impair our ability to obtain and retain customers, which would adversely affect both our ability to generate revenues and our operating results. Furthermore, we are dependent upon internet service providers, telecommunications carriers and utility providers, some of which have experienced significant system failures and outages in the past. Our customers may in the future experience difficulties due to system failures unrelated to our systems and offerings. If, for any reason, these providers fail to provide the required services, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted. New technologies or changes in our or a customer’s business model could make our communications infrastructure leasing business less desirable and result in decreasing revenues and operating results. The development and implementation of new technologies designed to enhance the efficiency of wireless networks or changes in a customer’s business model could reduce the need for tower-based wireless services, decrease demand for tower space or reduce previously obtainable lease rates. In addition, if the industry trends toward deploying increased capital to the development and implementation of new technologies, then customers may allocate less of their budgets to leasing space on our towers. Examples of these technologies include more spectrally efficient technologies, which could relieve a portion of our customers’ network capacity needs and, as a result, could reduce the demand for tower-based antenna space. Additionally, certain small cell complementary network technologies or satellite services could shift a portion of our customers’ network investments away from traditional tower-based networks, which may reduce the need for carriers to add more equipment at certain communications sites. Moreover, the emergence of alternative technologies could reduce the need for tower-based broadcast services transmission and reception. Further, a customer may decide to cease outsourcing tower infrastructure or otherwise change its business model, which would result in a decrease in our revenue and operating results. Similarly, our data center site infrastructure may become antiquated due to the development of new systems that deliver power to, or eliminate heat from, the servers and other customer equipment that we house or the development of new technology that requires levels of power and cooling density that our facilities are not designed to provide. Our failure to innovate in response to the development and implementation of these or other new technologies or changes in a customer’s business model could have a material adverse effect on the growth of our business, results of operations or financial condition. Conversely, we may invest significant capital in technologies, platform expansion initiatives or new additions to our core business that may not provide expected returns or profitability, which could divert management attention and have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Competition for assets could adversely affect our ability to achieve our return on investment criteria. We may experience increased competition for the acquisition of communications infrastructure assets or contracts to build new communications infrastructure assets for customers, which could make the acquisition of high-quality assets significantly more costly or prohibitive or cause us to lose contracts to build new sites. Some of our competitors are larger and may have greater financial resources than we do, while other competitors may apply less stringent investment criteria than we do. In addition, we may not anticipate increased competition entering a particular market or competing for the same assets. Higher prices for assets or the failure to add new assets to our portfolio could make it more difficult to achieve our anticipated returns on investment or future growth, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, some of our data center competitors have significant advantages over us, including greater name recognition, longer operating histories, lower operating costs, lower levels of leverage, pre-existing relationships with current or potential customers, greater financial, marketing and other resources, access to better networks and access to less expensive power. These advantages could allow our data center competitors to respond more quickly or effectively to strategic opportunities and as a 13 Table of Conten ts result, we may lose existing or potential data center customers, incur costs to improve our properties or be forced to reduce our rental rates. These risks are compounded by the fact that a significant percentage of our data center customer leases expire every year. Risks Related to Our Financial Performance or General Economic Conditions Our leverage and debt service obligations may materially and adversely affect our ability to raise additional financing to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives and to satisfy our distribution requirements. Our leverage and debt service obligations, including as a result of our recent CoreSite Acquisition and Telxius Acquisition, could have significant negative consequences to our business, results of operations or financial condition, including: • requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our debt, thereby reducing the amount of our cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures and REIT distributions; • impairing our ability to meet one or more of the financial ratio covenants contained in our debt agreements or to generate cash sufficient to pay interest or principal due under those agreements, which could result in an acceleration of some or all of our outstanding debt and the loss of the towers securing such debt if a default remains uncured; • limiting our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing, thereby placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitors and competitors that may have better access to capital resources, including with respect to acquiring assets; and • limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the markets in which we compete. We may need to raise additional capital through debt financing activities, asset sales or equity issuances, even if the then-prevailing market conditions are not favorable, to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, required purchases of our partners’ interests and to satisfy our distribution requirements and debt service obligations and leverage requirements, including financial ratio covenants. An increase in our total leverage could lead to a downgrade of our credit rating below investment grade, which could negatively impact our ability to access credit markets or preclude us from obtaining funds on investment grade terms, rates and conditions or subject us to additional loan covenants, which could accelerate our debt repayment obligations. Further, certain of our current debt instruments limit the amount of indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may incur. Additional financing, therefore, may be unavailable, more expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness. Further, market volatility and disruption caused by factors such as COVID-19, inflation, rising interest rates and supply chain disruptions may impact our ability to raise additional capital through debt and equity financing activities or our ability to repay or refinance maturing liabilities, or impact the terms of any new obligations, which in turn may have an adverse impact on our credit ratings. The extent to which these factors will impact our business and financial results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time due to the rapid evolution of this uncertain situation. Rising inflation may adversely affect us by increasing costs beyond what we can recover through price increases. Inflation can adversely affect us by increasing the costs of land, materials, labor and other costs required to manage and grow our business. In addition, should inflation rates exceed our fixed escalator percentages in markets where our leases include fixed escalators, our returns could be adversely affected. In an inflationary environment, such as the current economic environment, depending on the terms of our contracts and other economic conditions, we may be unable to raise prices enough to keep up with the rate of inflation, which would reduce our profit margins and returns. If we are unable to increase our prices to offset the effects of inflation, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates. The impact of COVID-19 may increase uncertainty in the global financial markets, as well as the possibility of high inflation and extended economic downturn, which could reduce our ability to incur debt or access capital and impact our results of operations and financial condition even after these conditions improve. Restrictive covenants in the agreements related to our securitization transactions, our credit facilities and our debt securities could materially and adversely affect our business by limiting flexibility, and we may be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock, which may jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a REIT. The agreements related to our securitization transactions include operating covenants and other restrictions customary for loans subject to rated securitizations. Among other things, the borrowers under the agreements are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets. A failure to comply with the covenants in the agreements could prevent the borrowers from taking certain actions with respect to the secured assets and could prevent the borrowers from distributing any excess cash from the operation of such assets to us. If the borrowers were to default on any of the loans, the 14 Table of Conten ts servicer on such loan could seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of the secured assets, in which case we could lose such assets and the cash flow associated with such assets. The agreements for our credit facilities also contain restrictive covenants and leverage and other financial maintenance tests that could limit our ability to take various actions, including incurring additional debt, guaranteeing indebtedness or making distributions to stockholders, including our required REIT distributions, and engaging in various types of transactions, including mergers, acquisitions and sales of assets. Additionally, our credit facilities restrict our and our subsidiaries’ ability to incur liens securing our or their indebtedness. These covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, new tower or other communications infrastructure development, mergers and acquisitions or other opportunities. Our credit agreements also contain cross-default and/or cross-acceleration provisions, which may be triggered if we default on certain indebtedness in excess of certain thresholds. In the event of such a default, the resulting cross-defaults or cross-accelerations could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Further, reporting and information covenants in our credit agreements and indentures require that we provide financial and operating information within certain time periods. If we are unable to provide the required information on a timely basis, we would be in breach of these covenants. For more information regarding the covenants and requirements discussed above, please see Item 7 of this Annual Report under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Factors Affecting Sources of Liquidity” and note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. We also enter into hedges for certain debt instruments, which may have an adverse impact on our results to the extent that the counterparties do not perform as expected at the inception of each hedge. We may be adversely affected by changes in LIBOR reporting practices, the method in which LIBOR is determined or the use of alternative reference rates. The United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”), which regulates the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), announced plans to phase out certain LIBOR rates by June 2023. As contemplated, the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot be assured after June 2023, and LIBOR will cease to exist or otherwise be unsuitable for benchmarking. While our bank facilities contain fallback provisions to establish an alternative rate in the event LIBOR is unavailable, the elimination of LIBOR could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Financial institutions may replace LIBOR with a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate; however, no consensus exists as to what may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, whether LIBOR rates will cease to be published or supported before June 2023 or whether any additional reforms to LIBOR may be enacted in the United Kingdom or elsewhere. Furthermore, the use of an alternative rate could result in increased costs, including increased interest expense, and increased borrowing and hedging costs in the future. We cannot predict the effect of the FCA’s decision not to sustain LIBOR or, if changes ultimately are made to LIBOR, the effect those changes may have on our interest expense related to borrowings under our bank facilities, certain other debt service obligations and interest swap agreements, which could potentially negatively impact our financial condition. Risks Related to Laws and Regulations Our business, and that of our customers, is subject to laws, regulations and administrative and judicial decisions, and changes thereto, that could restrict our ability to operate our business as we currently do or impact our competitive landscape. Our business, and that of our customers, is subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws, treaties and regulations and administrative and judicial decisions. In certain jurisdictions, these regulations, laws and treaties could be applied or be enforced retroactively. Zoning authorities and community organizations are sometimes opposed to the construction of communications sites in their communities, which can delay, prevent or increase the cost of new tower construction, modifications, additions of new antennas to a site or site upgrades, thereby limiting our ability to respond to customer demands. Existing or new regulatory policies, regulations or laws may materially and adversely affect the timing, cost or completion of our communications sites or result in changes in the competitive landscape that may negatively affect our business. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to litigants or result in decreased revenue. In addition, in certain jurisdictions, we and certain of our customers are required to pay annual license fees, which may be subject to substantial increases by the government, or new fees may be enacted and applied retroactively. Governmental licenses may also be subject to periodic renewal and additional conditions to receive or maintain such license. Additionally, we have government customers for several of our communications sites and data centers, which subjects us to risks including early termination, audits, investigations, sanctions and penalties. In addition, federal, state and local governments in many of our markets have recently taken actions to contain the spread of COVID-19, including travel bans, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and business shutdowns, among others, and may take 15 Table of Conten ts additional actions in the future. In response to governmental actions, we have taken a variety of measures, including providing support for our customers remotely, supporting continued work-from-home arrangements and restricting travel for our employees where practicable and other modifications to our business practices. These governmental actions could remain effective for a prolonged period of time with potential material adverse impacts on our, and our customers’, business operations. Moreover, while the restrictions and limitations noted above may be relaxed or rolled back if and when COVID-19 abates or vaccinations become more prevalent, such government actions may be reinstated as the pandemic continues to evolve and in response to actual or potential resurgences, including due to emerging variants. The scope and timing of any such reinstatement is difficult to predict and may materially and adversely affect our operations in the future. Furthermore, the tax laws, regulations, applicable license terms and conditions, and interpretations governing our business, and that of our customers, in jurisdictions where we operate, may change at any time, potentially with retroactive effect. This includes changes in tax laws, spectrum use terms, administrative compliance guidance or judicial interpretations thereof. For example, the definition and application of AGR in India and associated fees and charges may have a material financial impact on certain of our customers which could affect their ability to perform their obligations under agreements with us. Changes in laws, regulations and judicial decisions could have a more significant impact on us as a REIT relative to other REITs due to the nature of our business and our use of taxable REIT subsidiaries. These factors could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. Our foreign operations are subject to economic, political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position, including risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Our international business operations and our potential expansion into additional new markets in the future expose us to potential adverse financial and operational problems not typically experienced in the United States. We anticipate that revenues from our international operations will continue to grow. Accordingly, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally, including: • uncertain, inconsistent or changing laws, regulations, rulings or methodologies impacting our existing and anticipated international operations, fees or other requirements directed specifically at the ownership and operation of communications infrastructure or our international acquisitions, any of which laws, fees or requirements may be applied retroactively or with significant delay; • failure to retain our tax status or to obtain an expected tax status for which we have applied; • expropriation resulting in government takeover of customer operations or governmental regulation restricting foreign ownership or requiring reversion or divestiture; • laws or regulations that tax or otherwise restrict repatriation of earnings or other funds or otherwise limit distributions of capital; • changes in a specific country’s or region’s political or economic conditions, including inflation or currency devaluation; • changes to zoning regulations or construction laws, which could be applied retroactively to our existing communications infrastructure; • actions restricting or revoking our customers’ spectrum licenses, or alterations or interpretations thereof, or suspending or terminating business under prior licenses; • failure to comply with anti-bribery laws such as the FCPA or similar local anti-bribery laws, or the Office of Foreign Assets Control requirements; • failure to comply with data privacy laws or other protections of employee health and personal information; • material site issues related to security, fuel availability and reliability of electrical grids; • significant increases in, or implementation of new, license surcharges on our revenue; • loss of key personnel, including expatriates, in markets where talent is difficult or expensive to acquire; and • price-setting or other similar laws or regulations for the sharing of passive infrastructure. We also face risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, including those arising from the impacts of COVID-19 on the global economy and markets and those arising from our operations, investments and financing transactions related to our international business. Volatility in foreign currency exchange rates, which has increased in the last few years as a result of uncertainties caused by COVID-19, can also affect our ability to plan, forecast and budget for our international operations and expansion efforts. Our revenues earned from our international operations are primarily denominated in their respective local currencies. We have not historically engaged in significant currency hedging activities relating to our non-U.S. Dollar operations, and a weakening of these foreign currencies against the U.S. Dollar would negatively impact our reported revenues, operating profits and income. If we fail to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT, we will be subject to tax at corporate income tax rates, which may substantially reduce funds otherwise available, and even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may face tax liabilities that impact earnings and available cash flow. 16 Table of Conten ts Commencing with the taxable year beginning January 1, 2012, we have operated as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. Qualification for taxation as a REIT requires the application of certain highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), which provisions may change from time to time, to our operations as well as various factual determinations concerning matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. Further, tax legislation may adversely affect our ability to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT or the benefits or desirability of remaining so qualified. There are few judicial or administrative interpretations of the relevant provisions of the Code. If, in any taxable year, we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT and are not entitled to relief under the Code: • we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders and would be subject to federal and state income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates, which could be substantial in amount, and may require us to borrow additional funds or liquidate some investments to pay any additional tax liability and, accordingly, may reduce funds available for other purposes; and • we will be disqualified from REIT tax treatment for the four taxable years immediately following the year during which we were so disqualified. We are subject to certain federal, state, local and foreign taxes on our income and assets, including taxes on any undistributed income and state, local or foreign income, franchise, property and transfer taxes. While state and local income tax regimes often parallel the U.S. federal income tax regime for REITs, many of these jurisdictions differ in their treatment of REITs. For example, some state and local jurisdictions currently or in the future may limit or eliminate a REIT’s deduction for dividends paid, which could increase our income tax expense. We are also subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and state, local and foreign tax authorities. The results of an audit and examination of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures may have an adverse effect on our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability. Furthermore, we have owned and may from time to time own direct and indirect ownership interests in subsidiary REITs, which must also comply with the same REIT requirements that we must satisfy, together with all other rules applicable to REITs. If the subsidiary REIT is determined to have failed to qualify for taxation as a REIT and certain relief provisions do not apply, then the subsidiary REIT would be subject to federal income tax, which tax we would economically bear along with applicable penalties and interest. In addition, our ownership of shares in such subsidiary REIT would fail to be a qualifying asset for purposes of the asset tests applicable to REITs and any dividend income or gains derived by us from such subsidiary REIT may cease to be treated as income that qualifies for purposes of the 75% gross income test. These consequences could have a material adverse effect on our ability to comply with the REIT income and asset tests, and thus our ability to qualify for taxation as a REIT. Complying with REIT requirements may limit our flexibility or cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities. Our use of TRSs enables us to engage in non-REIT qualifying business activities. Under the Code, no more than 20% of the value of the assets of a REIT may be represented by securities of one or more TRSs and no more than 25% of the value of the assets of the REIT may be represented by non-qualifying assets (including securities of one or more TRSs). This limitation may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments or take advantage of acquisition opportunities, including the purchase of non-qualifying assets, the expansion of non-real estate activities and investments in the businesses to be conducted by our TRSs, and to that extent limit our opportunities and our flexibility to change our business strategy. Further, as a REIT, we must distribute to our stockholders an amount equal to at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain). To meet our annual distribution requirements, we may be required to distribute amounts that may otherwise be used for our operations, including amounts that may otherwise be invested in future acquisitions, capital expenditures or repayment of debt. As no more than 25% of our gross income may consist of dividend income from our TRSs and other non-qualifying types of income, our ability to receive distributions from our TRSs may be limited, which may impact our ability to fund distributions to our stockholders or to use income of our TRSs to fund other investments. In addition, the majority of our income and cash flows from our TRSs are generated from our international operations. In many cases, there are local withholding taxes and currency controls that may impact our ability or willingness to repatriate funds to the United States to help satisfy REIT distribution requirements. We could have liability under environmental and occupational safety and health laws. Our operations are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations, including those relating to the management, use, storage, disposal, emission and remediation of, and exposure to, hazardous and non-hazardous substances, materials and wastes. As the owner, lessee or operator of real property and facilities, including generators, we may be liable for substantial costs of investigation, removal or remediation of soil and groundwater 17 Table of Conten ts contaminated by hazardous materials, and for damages and costs relating to off-site migration of hazardous materials, without regard to whether we, as the owner, lessee or operator, knew of, or were responsible for, the contamination. We may also be liable for certain costs of remediating contamination at third-party sites to which we sent waste for disposal, even if the original disposal may have complied with all legal requirements at the time. Many of these laws and regulations contain information reporting and record keeping requirements. We may not be at all times in compliance with all environmental requirements. Further, our data center properties are subject to various federal, state and local regulations, such as state and local fire and life safety regulations and ADA federal requirements. We may be subject to potentially significant fines or penalties if we fail to comply with any of these requirements. The requirements of the environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and could become more stringent in the future. In certain jurisdictions, these laws and regulations could be applied retroactively or be broadened to cover situations or persons not currently considered. It is possible that these requirements will change or that liabilities will arise in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. While we maintain environmental and workers’ compensation insurance, we may not have adequate insurance to cover all costs, fines or penalties. Risks Related to the Operation of Our Business Our towers, fiber networks, data centers or computer systems may be affected by natural disasters (including as a result of climate change) and other unforeseen events for which our insurance may not provide adequate coverage or result in increased insurance premiums. Our towers, fiber networks, data centers and computer systems are subject to risks associated with natural disasters, such as hurricanes, ice and windstorms, tornadoes, floods, earthquakes and wildfires, as well as other unforeseen events, such as the potential adverse effects of COVID-19 or other pandemics and acts of terrorism. During the past several years, we have seen an increase in severe weather events and expect this trend to continue due to climate change. Climate change or efforts to regulate emissions may also have direct or indirect effects on our business by increasing the cost of emission compliance or fuel we need to deliver primary power to our customers under our contractual obligations, typically through diesel-powered generators, in emerging markets. Additional environmental liabilities, such as contamination, asbestos-containing building materials and mold or other air quality issues at some of our data centers, could arise and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and performance. In addition, governmental initiatives to address climate change and future initiatives could, if adopted, require us and our customers to make capital expenditures to be compliant with these initiatives and increase our and our customers’ costs. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or other requirements imposed on us could also lead to fines and/or lost revenue. We could also face a negative impact on our reputation with the public and our customers if we violate climate change laws or regulations. In October 2021, we adopted science-based targets, which were approved by the Science Based Targets initiative and are in line with the goals set forth in the 2015 Paris Agreement. These goals may require us to expend significant resources to meet them, which could increase our operational costs. Failing to meet these goals could result in customer dissatisfaction and damage to our reputation with our key stakeholders, which could in turn adversely impact our results of operations. Further, any damage or destruction to, or inability to access, our towers, fiber networks, data centers or computer systems, as a result of measures implemented in response to COVID-19 or otherwise, may cause supply chain delays or impact our ability to provide services to our customers and lead to customer loss, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition and also, our communications sites could be subject to attacks instigated by claims that the deployment of 5G networks is linked to adverse health effects. While we maintain insurance coverage for certain natural disasters and business interruption, we may not have adequate insurance to cover the associated costs of repair or reconstruction of sites or fiber for a major future event, lost revenue, including from new customers that could have been added to our towers, fiber networks or data centers but for the event, or other costs to remediate the impact of a significant event, such was wildfire damage caused by our towers. Further, we may be liable for damage caused by towers that collapse for any number of reasons including structural deficiencies, which could harm our reputation and require us to incur costs for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage. If we, or third parties on which we rely, experience technology failures, including cybersecurity incidents or the loss of personally identifiable information, we may incur substantial costs and suffer other negative consequences, which may include reputational damage. As part of our normal business activities, including in our data centers, we rely on energy systems, communication networks, information technology and other computing resources. We may be vulnerable to physical or cybersecurity breaches that could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and operating results. We face risks 18 Table of Conten ts associated with unauthorized access to our or our vendors’ computer systems, loss or destruction of data, computer viruses, malware, distributed denial-of-service attacks or other malicious activities. These threats may result from human error, equipment failure or fraud or malice on the part of employees or third parties. A party who is able to compromise the security measures on our or our vendors’ networks or the security of our communications infrastructure could misappropriate either our proprietary information or the personal information of our customers or our employees, or cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations or our customers’ operations. As we provide assurances to our customers that we provide a high level of security, such a compromise could be particularly harmful to our brand and reputation. We may be required to expend significant capital and resources to protect against such threats or to alleviate problems caused by breaches in security. Globally, the frequency, severity and sophistication of cybersecurity incidents have increased, and these trends may continue. We are continuously evaluating and enhancing our cybersecurity and information security systems and creating new systems and processes. However, there can be no assurance that these measures will be effective in preventing or limiting the impact of future cybersecurity incidents. As techniques used to breach security grow in frequency and sophistication, and are generally not recognized until launched against a target, we, or our vendors, may not be able to promptly detect that a cyber breach has occurred or implement security measures in a timely manner. If and when implemented, we, or our vendors, may not be able to determine the extent to which these measures could be circumvented. Any breaches that may occur could expose us to increased risk of lawsuits, regulatory penalties, loss of existing or potential customers, damage relating to loss of proprietary information, harm to our reputation and increases in our security costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and operating results. We offer managed services in certain of our data centers where we provide “smart hands” services for our customers. The access to our customers’ networks and data, which is gained from these services, creates some risk that our customers’ networks or data will be improperly accessed. If we were held responsible for any such breach, it could result in a significant loss to us, including damage to our customer relationships, harm to our brand and reputation and legal liability. Additionally, while we maintain insurance coverage for cybersecurity incidents, we may not have adequate insurance to cover the associated costs in the event of a breach resulting in loss of data, such as personally identifiable information or other such data protected by data privacy or other laws, and we may be liable for damages, fines and penalties for such losses under applicable regulatory frameworks. Although we and our vendors have disaster recovery programs and security measures in place, if our computer systems and our backup systems are compromised, degraded, damaged, breached or otherwise cease to function properly, we could suffer interruptions in our operations, including our ability to correctly record, process and report financial information, our customers’ network availability may be impacted or we could unintentionally allow misappropriation of proprietary or confidential information (including information about our customers or landlords, or customer information on our fiber, data center or managed networks businesses), which could result in a loss of revenue, damage to our reputation, damage to our customer and vendor relationships, litigation, regulatory investigations and penalties under existing or future data privacy laws and require us to incur significant costs to remediate or otherwise resolve these issues. In addition, our recent acquisitions, including our acquisitions of data centers, may increase our exposure to the risks described above and have material and adverse effects on our business. Our costs could increase and our revenues could decrease due to perceived health risks from radio emissions, especially if these perceived risks are substantiated. Public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and other wireless communications technology could slow the growth of wireless companies, which could in turn slow our growth. In particular, negative public perception of, and regulations regarding, these perceived health risks, including claims that the deployment of 5G networks is linked to adverse health effects, could undermine the market acceptance of wireless communications services and increase opposition to the development and expansion of tower sites. If a scientific study, court decision or government agency ruling resulted in a finding that radio frequency emissions pose health risks to consumers, it could negatively impact our customers and the market for wireless services, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. We do not maintain any significant insurance with respect to these matters. If we are unable to protect our rights to the land under our towers and buildings in which our data centers are located, it could adversely affect our business and operating results. Our real property interests relating to our towers consist primarily of leasehold and sub-leasehold interests, fee interests, easements, licenses and rights-of-way. A loss of these interests at a particular tower site may interfere with our ability to operate that tower site and generate revenues. For various reasons, we may not always have the ability to access, analyze and verify all information regarding titles and other issues prior to completing an acquisition of communications sites, which can affect our rights to access and operate a site. From time to time, we also experience disputes with landowners regarding the terms of easements or ground agreements for land under towers, which can affect our ability to access and operate tower sites. Further, for various reasons, landowners may not want to renew their ground agreements with us, they may lose their rights to the land, or they may transfer their land interests to third parties, including ground lease aggregators, which could affect our ability to 19 Table of Conten ts renew ground agreements on commercially viable terms. A significant number of the communications sites in our portfolio are located on land we lease pursuant to long-term operating leases. Further, for various reasons, title to property interests in some of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate may not be as certain as title to our property interests in the United States. Our inability to protect our rights to the land under our towers may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. We do not own the buildings for all of our data centers and our business could be harmed if we are unable to renew the leases for these data centers at favorable terms or at all, though we generally have the right to extend the terms of our leases when the primary terms of the leases expire. Failure to increase operating revenues to sufficiently offset any potential increase in lease costs, including as a result of the current inflationary environment, would adversely impact our operating income. We could also lose customers due to the disruptions in their operations caused by our inability to renew our data center leases. Additionally, we rely on our landlords for basic maintenance of our leased data centers. If such landlords have not maintained our leased properties sufficiently, we may be forced into an early exit from one or more of these data centers, which could be disruptive to our business. If we are unable or choose not to exercise our rights to purchase towers that are subject to lease and sublease agreements at the end of the applicable period, our cash flows derived from those towers will be eliminated. Our communications real estate portfolio includes towers that we operate pursuant to lease and sublease agreements that include a purchase option at the end of the lease period. We may not have the required available capital to exercise our right to purchase the towers at the end of the applicable period, or we may choose, for business or other reasons, not to do so. If we do not exercise these purchase rights, and are unable to extend the lease or sublease or otherwise acquire an interest that would allow us to continue to operate these towers after the applicable period, we will lose the cash flows derived from the towers. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES As of December 31, 2021, we owned and operated a portfolio of 220,131 communications sites, including 1,778 DAS networks. See the table in Item 7 of this Annual Report, under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Executive Overview” for more detailed information on the geographic locations of our communications sites. In addition, we own property interests that we lease to communications service providers and third-party tower operators in Canada and the United States, which are included in our U.S. & Canada property segment, and in Australia, which are included in our Asia-Pacific property segment, and also own and operate data center facilities and related assets in the United States, which are included in our Data Centers segment. Our interests in our communications sites consist of a variety of ownership interests, including leases created by long-term ground lease agreements, easements, licenses or rights-of-way granted by government entities. A typical tower site consists of a compound enclosing the tower site, a tower structure and, in some cases, one or more equipment shelters that house a variety of transmitting, receiving and switching equipment. In addition, many of our international sites typically include power generators and batteries, which are often used for primary power in lieu of an electric grid connection in select markets. The principal types of our towers are guyed, self-supporting lattice and monopole, and rooftop towers in our international markets. • A guyed tower includes a series of cables attaching separate levels of the tower to anchor foundations in the ground and can reach heights of up to 2,000 feet. A typical guyed broadcast tower can be located a tract of land of up to 20 acres. • A self-supporting lattice tower typically tapers from the bottom up and usually has three or four legs. A lattice tower can reach heights of up to 1,000 feet, although most lattice structures are between 200 and 400 feet. Depending on the height of the tower, a lattice tower site can be located on a tract of land of 10,000 square feet for a rural site or fewer than 2,500 square feet for a metropolitan site. • A monopole tower is a tubular structure that is used primarily to address space constraints or aesthetic concerns. Monopoles typically have heights ranging from 50 to 200 feet. A monopole tower site used in metropolitan areas for a typical wireless communications tower can be located on a tract of land of fewer than 2,500 square feet. 20 Table of Conten ts • Rooftop towers are primarily used in metropolitan areas in our Asia-Pacific, Africa, Europe and Latin America markets, where locations for traditional tower structures are unavailable. Rooftop towers typically have heights ranging from 10 to 100 feet. U.S. & Canada Property Segment Encumbered Sites . As of December 31, 2021, the loan underlying the securitization transactions completed in March 2013 and March 2018 (the “2013 Securitization” and the “2018 Securitization”, respectively, and together, the “Trust Securitizations”) is secured by mortgages, deeds of trust and deeds to secure the loan on substantially all of the 5,113 broadcast and wireless communications towers and related assets owned by the borrowers (the “Trust Sites”) and the secured revenue notes issued in a private transaction completed in May 2015 (the “2015 Securitization”) are secured by mortgages, deeds of trust and deeds to secure debt on substantially all of the 3,531 communications sites owned by subsidiaries of the issuer (the “2015 Secured Sites”). There are no encumbered sites in our Asia-Pacific, Africa, Europe or Latin America property segments or in our Data Centers segment. Ground Leases. Of the 218,353 towers in our portfolio as of December 31, 2021, approximately 90% were located on land we lease. Typically, we seek to enter long-term ground leases, which have initial terms of approximately five to ten years with one or more automatic or exercisable renewal periods. As a result, 41% of the ground leases for our sites have a final expiration date of 2031 and beyond. Customers . Our customers are primarily wireless service providers, broadcasters and other companies in a variety of industries. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our top three customers by total revenue were T-Mobile (20%), AT&T (19%) and Verizon Wireless (13%). Across most of our markets, our tenant leases for our communications sites with wireless carriers have initial non-cancellable terms of five to ten years with multiple renewal terms. As a result, approximately 64% of our current tenant leases have a renewal date of 2027 or beyond. Data Centers. We own and operate data center facilities and related assets, and as of December 31, 2021, our data center portfolio consisted of 27 data center facilities across ten United States markets, including the assets acquired as part of the CoreSite Acquisition, as well as our previously acquired data center facilities, across 3.1 million net rentable square feet (“NRSF”). Offices. Our principal corporate headquarters is leased and located in Boston, Massachusetts, where we currently lease approximately 40,000 square feet of office space. We also own or have entered into long-term leases for the majority of our facilities in international and regional locations for the management and operation of our property and services businesses, including offices in each of our U.S. & Canada, Asia-Pacific, Africa, Europe, Latin America and Data Centers segments. Our international headquarters is leased and located in Amsterdam, Netherlands. We believe that our owned and leased facilities are suitable and adequate to meet our anticipated needs. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS We periodically become involved in various claims and lawsuits that are incidental to our business. In the opinion of management, after consultation with counsel, there are no matters currently pending that would, in the event of an adverse outcome, have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES N/A. 21 Table of Conten ts PART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Our common stock is listed on the NYSE under the ticker symbol AMT. As of February 17, 2022, we had 455,884,806 outstanding shares of common stock and 141 registered holders. Dividends As a REIT, we must annually distribute to our stockholders an amount equal to at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain). Generally, we have distributed and expect to continue to distribute all or substantially all of our REIT taxable income after taking into consideration our utilization of net operating losses ( “ NOLs ” ). The amount, timing and frequency of future distributions will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon various factors, a number of which may be beyond our control, including our financial condition and operating cash flows, the amount required to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT and reduce any income and excise taxes that we otherwise would be required to pay, limitations on distributions in our existing and future debt and preferred equity instruments, our ability to utilize NOLs to offset our distribution requirements, limitations on our ability to fund distributions using cash generated through our TRSs and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant.

[RESERVED] N/A. ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations that follow are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences could be material to the financial statements. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report and the accompanying notes, and the information set forth under the caption “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” below. During the fourth quarter of 2021, as a result of the CoreSite Acquisition, we updated our reportable segments to add a Data Centers segment. The Data Centers segment is included within our property operations. We will now report our results in seven segments – U.S. & Canada property (which includes all assets in the United States and Canada, other than our data center facilities and related assets), Asia-Pacific property, Africa property, Europe property, Latin America property, Data Centers and Services. We believe this change provides greater visibility into our operating segments and aligns our reporting with management’s current approach of allocating costs and resources, managing growth and profitability and assessing the operating performance of our business segments. This change applies to our business operations results beginning with the fourth quarter of 2021 and had no impact on our consolidated financial statements for any prior periods. Historical financial information included in this Annual Report has not been adjusted as the amounts attributable to data center assets were insignificant as prior to to the fourth quarter of 2021, we owned one data center. In evaluating financial performance in each business segment, management uses, among other factors, segment gross margin and segment operating profit (see note 21 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report). Executive Overview We are one of the largest global REITs and a leading independent owner, operator and developer of multitenant communications real estate. Our primary business is the leasing of space on communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, wireless data providers, government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries. In addition to the communications sites in our portfolio, we manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements. We also hold other telecommunications infrastructure, fiber and property interests that we lease primarily to communications service providers and third-party tower operators, and, as discussed further below, we hold a portfolio of highly interconnected data center facilities and related assets in the United States. Our customers include our tenants, licensees and other payers. We refer to the business encompassing the above as our property operations, which accounted for 97% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 and includes our U.S. & Canada property, Asia-Pacific property, Africa property, Europe property and Latin America property segments and Data Centers segment. We also offer tower-related services in the United States, including site application, zoning and permitting and structural analysis, which primarily support our site leasing business, including the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites. 23 Table of Conten ts The following table details the number of communications sites, excluding managed sites, that we owned or operated as of December 31, 2021: Number of Owned Towers Number of Operated Towers (1) Number of Owned DAS Sites U.S. & Canada: Canada 218 — — United States 27,276 15,363 451 U.S. & Canada total 27,494 15,363 451 Asia-Pacific: (2) Bangladesh 120 — — India 74,596 — 912 Philippines 97 — — Asia-Pacific total 74,813 — 912 Africa: Burkina Faso 707 — — Ghana 3,384 661 28 Kenya 2,997 — 9 Niger 754 — — Nigeria 6,980 — — South Africa 2,923 — — Uganda 3,710 — 12 Africa total 21,455 661 49 Europe: France 3,444 310 9 Germany 14,739 — — Poland 49 — — Spain 11,490 — — Europe total 29,722 310 9 Latin America: Argentina 487 — 11 Brazil 20,732 2,083 109 Chile 3,737 — 137 Colombia 4,982 — 6 Costa Rica 690 — 2 Mexico 9,845 186 92 Paraguay 1,443 — — Peru 3,900 450 — Latin America total 45,816 2,719 357 _______________ (1) Approximately 95% of the operated towers are held pursuant to long-term finance leases, including those subject to purchase options. (2) We also control land under carrier or other third-party communications sites in Australia, which provides recurring cash flow through tenant leasing arrangements. In January 2021, we entered into the Telxius Acquisition, pursuant to which we agreed to acquire Telxius’ European and Latin American tower divisions, comprising approximately 31,000 communications sites in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Germany, Peru and Spain, for approximately 7.7 billion EUR (approximately $9.4 billion at the date of signing), subject to certain adjustments. We completed the acquisition of nearly 27,000 communications sites in June 2021 and acquired the approximately 4,000 remaining communications sites in Germany in August 2021, for total consideration of approximately 7.9 billion EUR (approximately $9.6 billion as of the closing dates), subject to certain post-closing adjustments. In December 2021, we completed the CoreSite Acquisition, through which we acquired over 20 data center facilities and related assets in eight United States markets, for total consideration of $10.4 billion, including the assumption and repayment of CoreSite’s existing debt. As of December 31, 2021, our property portfolio included 27 operating data center facilities across ten markets in the United States that collectively comprise approximately 3.1 million NRSF of data center space, as detailed below: Number of Data Centers Total NRSF (1) (in thousands) San Francisco Bay, CA 8 940 Los Angeles, CA 3 686 Northern Virginia, VA 5 536 New York, NY 2 203 Chicago, IL 2 233 Boston, MA 1 143 Denver, CO 2 35 Miami, FL 1 30 Orlando, FL 1 129 Atlanta, GA 2 128 Total 27 3,063 _______________ (1) Excludes approximately 0.4 million of office and light-industrial NRSF acquired as part of the CoreSite Acquisition. In most of our markets, our tenant leases for our communications sites with wireless carriers generally have initial non-cancellable terms of five to ten years with multiple renewal terms. Accordingly, the vast majority of the revenue generated by our property operations during the year ended December 31, 2021 was recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. Most of our tenant leases for our communications sites have provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease, typically based on an annual fixed escalation (averaging approximately 3% in the United States) or an inflationary index in most of our international markets, or a combination of both. In addition, certain of our tenant leases provide for additional revenue primarily to cover costs, such as ground rent or power and fuel costs. Based upon existing customer leases and foreign currency exchange rates as of December 31, 2021, we expect to generate over $61 billion of non-cancellable customer lease revenue over future periods, before the impact of straight-line lease accounting. The revenues generated by our property operations may be affected by cancellations of existing tenant leases. As discussed above, most of our tenant leases with wireless carriers and broadcasters are multiyear contracts, which typically are non-cancellable; however, in some instances, a lease may be cancelled upon the payment of a termination fee. Revenue lost from either tenant lease cancellations or the non-renewal of leases or rent renegotiations, which we refer to as churn, has historically not had a material adverse effect on the revenues generated by our consolidated property operations. During the year ended December 31, 2021, churn was approximately 4% of our tenant billings. Beginning in late 2017, we experienced an increase in revenue lost from cancellations or non-renewals primarily due to carrier consolidation-driven churn in India, which compressed our gross margin and operating profit, particularly in our Asia-Pacific property segment, although this impact was partially offset by lower expenses due to reduced tenancy on existing sites and the decommissioning of certain sites. For the year ended December 31, 2021, aggregate carrier consolidation in India did not have a material impact on our consolidated property revenue, gross margin or operating profit, although overall churn rates in India remained elevated relative to historical levels. We anticipate that our churn rate in India will moderate over time and result in reduced impacts on our property revenue, gross margin and operating profit. In the immediate term, we believe that our churn rate may remain elevated as our tenants in India evaluate how best to comply with the recent court rulings by the Supreme Court of India and determine their obligations under payment plans for the AGR fees and charges prescribed by such court, as further discussed in Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption “Risk Factors—Our business, and that of our customers, is subject to laws, regulations and administrative and judicial decisions, and changes thereto, that could restrict our ability to operate our business as we currently do or impact our competitive landscape.” We expect to periodically evaluate the carrying value of our Indian assets, which may result in the realization of additional impairment expense or other similar charges. For more information, please see the information under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.” Additionally, we expect that our churn rate in our U.S. & Canada property segment will remain elevated for a period of several years due to contractual lease cancellations and non-renewals by T-Mobile, including legacy Sprint Corporation leases, pursuant to the terms of the T-Mobile MLA entered into in September 2020. As further set forth in Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption “Risk Factors,” the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the response to mitigate its spread and effects, may adversely impact us and our customers and the demand for our communications infrastructure in the United States and globally. We have taken a variety of actions to ensure the continued availability of our communications infrastructure assets, while ensuring the safety and security of our employees, customers, 24 Table of Conten ts vendors and surrounding communities. These measures include providing support for our customers remotely, supporting continued work-from-home arrangements and restricting travel for our employees where practicable and other modifications to our business practices. We will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions as may be required by governmental authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers and business partners. Property Operations Revenue Growth . Due to our diversified communications site portfolio, our tenant lease rates vary considerably depending upon numerous factors, including, but not limited to, amount, type and position of tenant equipment on the tower, remaining tower capacity and tower location. We measure the remaining tower capacity by assessing several factors, including tower height, tower type, environmental conditions, existing equipment on the tower and zoning and permitting regulations in effect in the jurisdiction where the tower is located. In many instances, tower capacity can be increased with relatively modest tower augmentation capital expenditures, which are often reimbursed to us. The primary factors affecting the revenue growth of our property segments are: • Growth in tenant billings, including: • New revenue attributable to leasing additional space on our sites (“colocations”) and lease amendments; • Contractual rent escalations on existing tenant leases, net of churn; and • New revenue attributable to leases in place on day one on sites acquired or constructed since the beginning of the prior-year period. • Revenue growth from our Data Centers segment in the United States, including growth attributable to increased customer demand for space, power and interconnection services and solutions. • Revenue growth from other items, including additional tenant payments primarily to cover costs, such as ground rent or power and fuel costs included in certain tenant leases (“pass-through”), straight-line revenue and decommissioning. We continue to believe that our site leasing revenue, which makes up the vast majority of our property segment revenue, is likely to increase due to the growing use of wireless services globally and our ability to meet the corresponding incremental demand for our communications real estate. By adding new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our sites, we are able to increase these sites’ utilization and profitability. We believe the majority of our site leasing activity will continue to come from wireless service providers, with tenants in a number of other industries contributing incremental leasing demand. Our site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with new business opportunities, which have historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth as wireless carriers seek to increase the coverage and capacity of their existing networks, while also deploying next generation wireless technologies. In addition, we intend to continue to supplement our organic growth by selectively developing or acquiring new sites in our existing and new markets where we can achieve our risk-adjusted return on investment objectives. Property Operations Organic Revenue Growth . Consistent with our strategy to increase the utilization and return on investment from our sites, our objective is to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants through colocation and lease amendments. Our ability to lease additional space on our sites is primarily a function of the rate at which wireless carriers and other tenants deploy capital to improve and expand their wireless networks. This rate, in turn, is influenced by the growth of wireless services, the penetration of advanced wireless devices, the level of emphasis on network quality and capacity in carrier competition, the financial performance of our tenants and their access to capital and general economic conditions. According to industry data, recent aggregate annual wireless capital spending in the United States has averaged at least $30 billion, resulting in consistent demand for our sites. Based on industry research and projections, we expect that a number of key industry trends will result in incremental revenue opportunities for us: • In less advanced wireless markets where network deployments are in earlier stages, we expect these deployments to drive demand for our tower space as carriers seek to expand their footprints and increase the scope and density of their networks. We have established operations in many of these markets at the early stages of wireless development, which we believe will enable us to meaningfully participate in these deployments over the long term. • Subscribers’ use of mobile data continues to grow rapidly given increasing smartphone and other advanced device penetration, the proliferation of bandwidth-intensive applications on these devices and the continuing evolution of the mobile ecosystem. We believe carriers will be compelled to deploy additional equipment on existing networks while also rolling out more advanced wireless networks to address coverage and capacity needs resulting from this increasing mobile data usage. • The deployment of advanced mobile technology, such as 4G and 5G, will provide higher speed data services and further enable fixed broadband substitution. As a result, we expect that our tenants will continue deploying additional equipment across their existing networks. • Wireless service providers compete based on the quality of their networks, which is driven by capacity and coverage. To maintain or improve their network performance as overall network usage increases, our tenants continue to deploy 25 Table of Conten ts additional equipment across their existing sites while also adding new cell sites. We anticipate increasing network densification over the next several years, as existing network density is anticipated to be insufficient to account for rapidly increasing levels of wireless data usage. • Wireless service providers continue to acquire additional spectrum, and as a result are expected to add additional sites and equipment to their networks as they seek to optimize their network configuration and utilize additional spectrum. We expect this to be particularly relevant in the context of higher-band spectrum such as 2.5 gigahertz (GHz) and C-Band being deployed for 5G, as these spectrum assets tend to have more limited propagation characteristics compared to the lower-band spectrum that has historically been deployed on our towers. • Next generation technologies requiring wireless connectivity have the potential to provide incremental revenue opportunities for us. These technologies may include edge computing functionality, autonomous vehicle networks and a number of other internet-of-things, or IoT, applications, as well as other potential use cases for wireless services. These technologies may create new and complementary use cases for our communications real estate over time, although these use cases are currently in nascent stages. • Continued data growth and emerging high-performance, latency-sensitive applications will drive an increased need for reliable, secure and interconnected data center solutions. We believe these trends will result in incremental utilization and interconnection demand at our data center facilities. As part of our international expansion initiatives, we have targeted markets in various stages of network development to diversify our international exposure and position us to benefit from a number of different wireless technology deployments over the long term. In addition, we have focused on building relationships with large multinational carriers to increase the opportunities for growth or mutually beneficial transactional opportunities across common markets. We believe that consistent carrier network investments across our international markets will, over the long term, position us to generate meaningful organic revenue growth going forward. In emerging markets, such as Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Ghana, India, Kenya, Niger, Nigeria, the Philippines and Uganda, wireless networks tend to be significantly less advanced than those in the United States, and initial voice networks continue to be deployed in certain underdeveloped areas. A majority of consumers in these markets still utilize basic wireless services and advanced device penetration remains low. In more developed urban locations within these markets, mobile data usage tends to be higher and advanced network deployments are further along. Carriers are focused on completing voice network build-outs while increasing investments in data networks as mobile data usage and smartphone penetration within their customer bases begin to accelerate. In India, the ongoing transition from 2G technology to 4G technology has included a period of carrier consolidation, whereby the number of carriers operating in the marketplace has been reduced through mergers, acquisitions and select carrier exits from the marketplace, which we believe is now substantially complete. We believe that this consolidation process has resulted in an industry structure for both the wireless carriers and communications infrastructure providers that will be more conducive to sustained growth and profitability over time. In markets with rapidly evolving network technology, such as South Africa, Poland and most of the countries in Latin America where we do business, initial voice networks, for the most part, have already been built out, and carriers are increasingly focused on 4G network deployments. Consumers in these regions are increasingly adopting smartphones and other advanced devices, in particular as lower cost smartphones become increasingly available. As a result, the usage of bandwidth-intensive mobile applications is growing materially. Recent spectrum auctions in these rapidly evolving markets have allowed incumbent carriers to accelerate their data network deployments and have also enabled new entrants to begin initial investments in data networks. Smartphone penetration and wireless data usage in these markets are advancing rapidly, which typically requires that carriers continue to invest in their networks to maintain and augment their quality of service. Finally, in markets with more mature network technology, such as Australia, Canada, Germany, France and Spain, carriers are focused on deploying 4G data networks to account for rapidly increasing wireless data usage among their customer base. With higher smartphone and advanced device penetration and significantly higher per capita data usage, carrier investment in networks is focused on 4G coverage and capacity, as well as the early stages of 5G deployment. We believe that the network technology migration we have seen in the United States, which has led to significantly denser networks and meaningful new business commencements for us over a number of years, will be replicated in our international markets over time. As a result, we expect to be able to leverage our extensive international portfolio of approximately 177,000 communications sites and the relationships we have built with our carrier tenants to drive sustainable, long - term growth. We have master lease agreements with many of our tenants for our communications sites that provide for consistent, long-term revenue and reduce the likelihood of non-contractual churn. Certain of those master lease agreements are comprehensive in nature and further build and augment strong strategic partnerships with our tenants while significantly reducing colocation cycle times, thereby providing our tenants with the ability to rapidly and efficiently deploy equipment on our sites. 26 Table of Conten ts Demand for our communications infrastructure assets could be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including an increase in network sharing or consolidation among our customers, as set forth in Item 1A of this Annual Report under the captions “Risk Factors—If our customers consolidate their operations, exit their businesses or share site infrastructure to a significant degree, our growth, revenue and ability to generate positive cash flows could be materially and adversely affected” and “Risk Factors—A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of customers, and we are sensitive to adverse changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our customers.” In addition, the emergence and growth of new technologies could reduce demand for our sites, as set forth under the caption “Risk Factors—New technologies or changes in our or a customer’s business model could make our communications infrastructure leasing business less desirable and result in decreasing revenues and operating results.” Further, our customers may be subject to new regulatory policies from time to time that materially and adversely affect the demand for our communications infrastructure assets. Property Operations New Site Revenue Growth. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we grew our portfolio of communications real estate through the acquisition and construction of approximately 38,950 communications sites globally. In a majority of our Asia-Pacific, Africa, Europe and Latin America markets, the revenue generated from newly acquired or constructed sites resulted in increases in both tenant and pass-through revenues (such as ground rent or power and fuel costs) and expenses. We continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire communications real estate portfolios, both domestically and internationally, to determine whether they meet our risk-adjusted hurdle rates and whether we believe we can effectively integrate them into our existing portfolio. New Sites (Acquired or Constructed) 2021 2020 2019 U.S. & Canada 170 2,255 430 Asia-Pacific 3,780 3,960 3,330 Africa 2,355 1,540 6,455 Europe 24,775 610 15 Latin America 7,870 1,000 3,475 During the year ended December 31, 2021, we also grew our portfolio of data center facilities through the acquisition of over 20 data center facilities and related assets in the United States, including through the CoreSite Acquisition. Property Operations Expenses. Direct operating expenses incurred by our property segments include direct site or facility level expenses and consist primarily of ground rent and power and fuel costs, some or all of which may be passed through to our customers, as well as property taxes and repairs and maintenance expenses. These segment direct operating expenses exclude all segment and corporate selling, general, administrative and development expenses, which are aggregated into one line item entitled Selling, general, administrative and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations. In general, our property segments’ selling, general, administrative and development expenses do not significantly increase as a result of adding incremental customers to our sites or facilities and typically increase only modestly year-over-year. As a result, leasing additional space to new customers on our sites or within our facilities provides significant incremental gross margin and cash flow. We may, however, incur additional segment selling, general, administrative and development expenses as we increase our presence in our existing markets or expand into new markets. Our profit margin growth is therefore positively impacted by the addition of new customers to our sites or facilities but can be temporarily diluted by our development activities. Services Segment Revenue Growth . As we continue to focus on growing our property operations, we anticipate that our services revenue will continue to represent a small percentage of our total revenues. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Included in our analysis of our results of operations are discussions regarding earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and accretion, as adjusted (“Adjusted EBITDA”), Funds From Operations, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“Nareit FFO”) attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders, Consolidated Adjusted Funds From Operations (“Consolidated AFFO”) and AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders. We define Adjusted EBITDA as Net income before Income (loss) from equity method investments; Income tax benefit (provision); Other income (expense); Gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations; Interest expense; Interest income; Other operating income (expense); Depreciation, amortization and accretion; and stock-based compensation expense. Nareit FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders is defined as net income before gains or losses from the sale or disposal of real estate, real estate related impairment charges, real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion and dividends on preferred stock, and including adjustments for (i) unconsolidated affiliates and (ii) noncontrolling 27 Table of Conten ts interests. In this section, we refer to Nareit FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders as “Nareit FFO (common stockholders).” We define Consolidated AFFO as Nareit FFO (common stockholders) before (i) straight-line revenue and expense; (ii) stock-based compensation expense; (iii) the deferred portion of income tax and other income tax adjustments; (iv) non-real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion; (v) amortization of deferred financing costs, capitalized interest, debt discounts and premiums and long-term deferred interest charges; (vi) other income (expense); (vii) gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations; (viii) other operating income (expense); and adjustments for (ix) unconsolidated affiliates and (x) noncontrolling interests, less cash payments related to capital improvements and cash payments related to corporate capital expenditures. We define AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders as Consolidated AFFO, excluding the impact of noncontrolling interests on both Nareit FFO (common stockholders) and the other adjustments included in the calculation of Consolidated AFFO. In this section, we refer to AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders as “AFFO (common stockholders).” Adjusted EBITDA, Nareit FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO and AFFO (common stockholders) are not intended to replace net income or any other performance measures determined in accordance with GAAP. None of Adjusted EBITDA, Nareit FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO or AFFO (common stockholders) represents cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and, therefore, these measures should not be considered indicative of cash flows from operating activities, as a measure of liquidity or a measure of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. Rather, Adjusted EBITDA, Nareit FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO and AFFO (common stockholders) are presented as we believe each is a useful indicator of our current operating performance. We believe that these metrics are useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because (1) each is a key measure used by our management team for decision making purposes and for evaluating our operating segments’ performance; (2) Adjusted EBITDA is a component underlying our credit ratings; (3) Adjusted EBITDA is widely used in the telecommunications real estate sector to measure operating performance as depreciation, amortization and accretion may vary significantly among companies depending upon accounting methods and useful lives, particularly where acquisitions and non-operating factors are involved; (4) Consolidated AFFO is widely used in the telecommunications real estate sector to adjust Nareit FFO (common stockholders) for items that may otherwise cause material fluctuations in Nareit FFO (common stockholders) growth from period to period that would not be representative of the underlying performance of property assets in those periods; (5) each provides investors with a meaningful measure for evaluating our period-to-period operating performance by eliminating items that are not operational in nature; and (6) each provides investors with a measure for comparing our results of operations to those of other companies, particularly those in our industry. Our measurement of Adjusted EBITDA, Nareit FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO and AFFO (common stockholders) may not, however, be fully comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA, Nareit FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO and AFFO (common stockholders) to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, have been included below. 28 Table of Conten ts Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019 For a discussion of our 2020 Results of Operations, including a discussion of our financial results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, refer to Part I, Item 7 of our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 25, 2021 (the “2020 Form 10-K”). During the fourth quarter of 2021, as a result of the CoreSite Acquisition, we updated our reportable segments to add a Data Centers segment. The Data Centers segment is included within our property operations. We will now report our results in seven segments – U.S. & Canada property (which includes all assets in the United States and Canada, other than our data center facilities and related assets), Asia-Pacific property, Africa property, Europe property, Latin America property, Data Centers and Services. We believe this change provides greater visibility into our operating segments and aligns our reporting with management’s current approach of allocating costs and resources, managing growth and profitability and assessing the operating performance of our business segments. This change applies to our business operations results beginning with the fourth quarter of 2021 and had no impact on our consolidated financial statements for any prior periods. Historical financial information included in this Annual Report has not been adjusted as the amounts attributable to data center assets were insignificant as prior to to the fourth quarter of 2021, we owned one data center.

For the year ended December 31, 2021, revenue attributable to our data center assets previously reported in the U.S. & Canada property segment is now shown in the Data Centers segment. Year ended December 31, 2021 U.S. & Canada property segment revenue growth of $403.2 million was attributable to: • Tenant billings growth of $287.6 million, which was driven by: ◦ $168.2 million generated from newly acquired or constructed sites, primarily related to our acquisition of InSite Wireless Group, LLC (“InSite,” and the acquisition, the “InSite Acquisition”); and ◦ $129.4 million due to colocations and amendments; ◦ Partially offset by: ▪ A decrease of $7.7 million from other tenant billings; and ▪ A decrease of $2.3 million from churn in excess of contractual escalations (as discussed above, we expect that our churn rate will be elevated for a period of several years due to the terms of the T-Mobile MLA); and • An increase of $115.6 million in other revenue, which includes a $143.7 million increase due to straight-line accounting, primarily due to the impact of the T-Mobile MLA, partially offset by a decrease in revenue attributable to our data center assets, which is presented in the Data Centers segment in the current period. Segment revenue growth was not meaningfully impacted by foreign currency translation related to fluctuations in the Canadian Dollar. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the assets acquired pursuant to the InSite Acquisition generated approximately $153.7 million in U.S. & Canada property revenue. 29 Table of Conten ts Asia-Pacific property segment revenue growth of $59.7 million was attributable to: • An increase of $41.6 million in pass-through revenue; and • Tenant billings growth of $22.7 million, which was driven by: ◦ $48.2 million due to colocations and amendments; and ◦ $24.7 million generated from newly acquired or constructed sites; ◦ Partially offset by: ▪ A decrease of $49.1 million resulting from churn in excess of contractual escalations; and ▪ A decrease of $1.1 million from other tenant billings; • Partially offset by a decrease of $6.8 million in other revenue, primarily due to tenant settlements in the prior-year period. Segment revenue growth included an increase of $2.2 million attributable to the positive impact of foreign currency translation related to fluctuations in Indian Rupee (“INR”). Africa property segment revenue growth of $115.3 million was attributable to: • Tenant billings growth of $90.6 million, which was driven by: ◦ $40.2 million due to colocations and amendments; ◦ $39.0 million generated from newly acquired or constructed sites; ◦ $7.6 million from contractual escalations, net of churn; and ◦ $3.8 million from other tenant billings; and • An increase of $44.9 million in pass-through revenue; • Partially offset by a decrease of $23.1 million in other revenue, primarily due to an increase in revenue reserves and a decrease in tenant settlements attributable to prior tenant cancellations. Segment revenue growth included an increase of $2.9 million attributable to the impact of foreign currency translation, which included, among others, positive impacts of $16.0 million related to fluctuations in South African Rand, partially offset by negative impacts related to fluctuations in the currencies of our other African markets, which included, among others, $12.2 million related to fluctuations in Nigerian Naira. Europe property segment revenue growth of $346.6 million was attributable to: • Tenant billings growth of $196.3 million, which was driven by: ◦ $189.8 million generated from newly acquired or constructed sites, primarily attributable to the Telxius Acquisition and our agreements with Orange S.A. (“Orange”); ◦ $7.9 million due to colocations and amendments; and ◦ $0.1 million from other tenant billings; ◦ Partially offset by a decrease of $1.5 million resulting from churn in excess of contractual escalations; • An increase of $128.9 million in pass-through revenue, primarily attributable to the Telxius Acquisition; and • An increase of $14.9 million in other revenue, primarily attributable to straight-line accounting, the Telxius Acquisition and increases in back-billing. Segment revenue growth included an increase of $6.5 million, primarily attributable to the positive impact of foreign currency translation related to fluctuations in EUR. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the assets acquired pursuant to the Telxius Acquisition generated approximately $318.0 million in Europe property revenue. Latin America property segment revenue growth of $208.0 million was attributable to: • Tenant billings growth of $114.5 million, which was driven by: ◦ $49.3 million generated from newly acquired or constructed sites, primarily attributable to the Telxius Acquisition; ◦ $33.8 million due to colocations and amendments; ◦ $27.9 million from contractual escalations, net of churn; and ◦ $3.5 million from other tenant billings; • An increase of $72.3 million in pass-through revenue, primarily attributable to increased pass-through ground rent costs in Brazil and the Telxius Acquisition; and • An increase of $27.2 million in other revenue primarily as a result of a tenant settlement in Brazil. Segment revenue growth included a decrease of $6.0 million, attributable to the impact of foreign currency translation, which included, among others, negative impacts of $28.0 million related to fluctuations in Brazilian Real and $4.8 million related to fluctuations in Peruvian Sol, partially offset by positive impacts related to fluctuations in the currencies of our other Latin American markets, which included, among others, $25.3 million related to fluctuations in Mexican Peso. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the assets acquired pursuant to the Telxius Acquisition generated approximately $70.7 million in Latin America property revenue. 30 Table of Conten ts Data Centers segment revenue growth was attributable to data centers acquired in 2021, including through the CoreSite Acquisition.

Other Operating Expenses Year Ended December 31, Percent Change 2021 vs 2020 2021 2020 Other operating expenses $ 398.7 $ 265.8 50 % The increase in other operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily attributable to increases in acquisition related costs, including pre-acquisition contingencies and settlements of $175.6 million, primarily associated with the Telxius Acquisition and the CoreSite Acquisition. These items were partially offset by a decrease in impairment charges of $49.1 million. Total Other Expense Year Ended December 31, Percent Change 2021 vs 2020 2021 2020 Total Other expense $ 302.6 $ 1,066.4 (72) % 33 Table of Conten ts Total other expense consists primarily of interest expense and realized and unrealized foreign currency gains and losses. We record unrealized foreign currency gains or losses as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations primarily associated with our intercompany notes and similar unaffiliated balances denominated in a currency other than the subsidiaries’ functional currencies. The decrease in total other expense during the year ended December 31, 2021 was due to foreign currency gains of $557.9 million in the current period, as compared to foreign currency losses of $216.4 million in the prior-year period, and a loss on retirement of long-term obligations of $38.2 million in the current period, attributable to the repayment of all amounts outstanding under the securitizations assumed in connection with the InSite Acquisition (the “InSite Debt”) and repayment of our 4.70% senior unsecured notes due 2022 (the “4.70% Notes”), as compared to a loss on retirement of long-term obligations of $71.8 million during the prior-year period attributable to the repayment of our 5.900% senior unsecured notes due 2021 (the “5.900% Notes”), our 3.300% senior unsecured notes due 2021 (the “3.300% Notes”) and our 3.450% senior unsecured notes due 2021 (the “3.450% Notes”).

In addition, we are able to offset certain income by utilizing our NOLs, subject to specified limitations. Consequently, the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations for each of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 differs from the federal statutory rate. The change in the income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily attributable to increases in reserves for uncertain tax positions and tax audit settlements, primarily in the United States and Mexico, in the current period.

(4) Primarily includes acquisition-related costs and integration costs. (5) Includes adjustments for the impact on both Nareit FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders as well as the other line items included in the calculation of Consolidated AFFO. Year Ended December 31, 2021 The increase in net income was primarily due to (i) an increase in our operating profit and (ii) a decrease in other expenses, primarily due to foreign currency gains in the current period as compared to foreign currency losses in the prior-year period, partially offset by (a) an increase in depreciation, amortization and accretion expense, (b) an increase in other operating expense, primarily attributable to acquisition related costs associated with the Telxius Acquisition and the CoreSite Acquisition, and (c) an increase in the income tax provision. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2021 included a loss on retirement of long-term obligations of $38.2 million, attributable to the repayment of the InSite Debt and the 4.70% Notes, as compared to a loss on retirement of long-term obligations of $71.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, attributable to the repayment of the 5.900% Notes, the 3.300% Notes and the 3.450% Notes. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily attributable to the increase in our gross margin and was partially offset by an increase in SG&A, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense, of $31.2 million. The increase in Consolidated AFFO and AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders was primarily attributable to the increase in our operating profit, excluding the impact of straight-line accounting, partially offset by increases in capital improvement and corporate capital expenditures, cash paid for taxes and cash paid for interest. The prior year period also included $63.3 million of previously deferred interest associated with a shareholder loan. The growth in AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders was also impacted by higher adjustments for unconsolidated affiliates and noncontrolling interests in Europe. 35 Table of Conten ts Liquidity and Capital Resources For a discussion of our 2020 Liquidity and Capital Resources, including a discussion of cash flows for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, refer to Part I, Item 7 of the 2020 Form 10-K. Overview During the year ended December 31, 2021, we increased our financial flexibility and our ability to grow our business while maintaining our long-term financial policies. Our significant 2021 financing transactions included: • Entry into the 2021 EUR Delayed Draw Term Loans, the 2021 USD Delayed Draw Term Loans, the BofA Bridge Loan Commitment and the JPM Bridge Loan Commitment (each as defined below). • Registered public offerings in an aggregate amount of $6.8 billion, including 3.0 billion EUR, of senior unsecured notes with maturities ranging from 2026 to 2051. • Registered public offering of 9,900,000 shares of our common stock for aggregate net proceeds of $2.4 billion. • Increase of our commitments under (i) our senior unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facility to $6.0 billion (as amended and restated as further described below, the “2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility”), (ii) our senior unsecured revolving credit facility to $4.0 billion (as amended and restated as further described below, the “2021 Credit Facility”) and (iii) our unsecured term loan to $1.0 billion (as amended and restated as further described below, the “2021 Term Loan”). • Repayment of all amounts outstanding under our $750.0 million unsecured term loan due February 12, 2021 (the “2020 Term Loan”). • Repayment of all amounts outstanding under the InSite Debt. • Repayment of all amounts outstanding under the 2021 EUR 364-Day Delayed Draw Term Loan (as defined below). • Repayment of $500.0 million of indebtedness under the 2021 Term Loan. • Redemption of the 4.70% Notes for an aggregate redemption price of approximately $715.1 million. The following table summarizes our liquidity as of December 31, 2021 (in millions): Available under the 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility $ 1,611.6 Available under the 2021 Credit Facility 2,590.0 Letters of credit (4.7) Total available under credit facilities, net 4,196.9 Cash and cash equivalents 1,949.9 Total liquidity $ 6,146.8 Subsequent to December 31, 2021, we made additional net borrowings of (i) $1.2 billion under the 2021 Credit Facility and (ii) $850.0 million under the 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility . The borrowings were used to repay existing indebtedness and for general corporate purposes. Summary cash flow information is set forth below for the years ended December 31, (in millions): 2021 2020 Net cash provided by (used for): Operating activities $ 4,819.9 $ 3,881.4 Investing activities (20,692.2) (4,784.6) Financing activities 16,424.5 1,215.3 Net effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash (70.3) (28.7) Net increase in cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash $ 481.9 $ 283.4 We use our cash flows to fund our operations and investments in our business, including maintenance and improvements, communications site construction, managed network installations and acquisitions. Additionally, we use our cash flows to make distributions, including distributions of our REIT taxable income to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT under the Code. We may also repay or repurchase our existing indebtedness or equity from time to time. We typically fund our international expansion efforts primarily through a combination of cash on hand, intercompany debt and equity contributions. In February 2021, we entered into an agreement with Macquarie SBI Infrastructure Investments Pte Limited and SBI Macquarie Infrastructure Trust (together, “Macquarie”), our remaining minority holders in ATC TIPL, to redeem 100% of their combined holdings in ATC TIPL (see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report) at a price of INR 175 per share, subject to certain adjustments. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we redeemed 100% of Macquarie’s 36 Table of Conten ts combined holdings in ATC TIPL, for total consideration of INR 12.9 billion (approximately $173.2 million at the date of redemption). As a result of the redemption, we now hold a 100% ownership interest in ATC TIPL. In May 2021 and June 2021, in connection with the funding of the Telxius Acquisition, we entered into agreements for CDPQ and Allianz to acquire 30% and 18% noncontrolling interests, respectively, in ATC Europe. We completed the ATC Europe Transactions in September 2021 for total aggregate consideration of 2.6 billion EUR (approximately $3.1 billion at the date of closing). After the completion of the ATC Europe Transactions, we hold a 52% controlling ownership interest in ATC Europe. As of December 31, 2021, we had total outstanding indebtedness of $43.5 billion, with a current portion of $4.6 billion. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we generated sufficient cash flow from operations, together with borrowings under our credit facilities, the 2021 EUR Delayed Draw Term Loans and the 2021 USD Delayed Draw Term Loans, proceeds from our equity and debt issuances and cash on hand, to fund our acquisitions, capital expenditures and debt service obligations, as well as our required distributions. We believe the cash generated by operating activities during the year ending December 31, 2022, together with our borrowing capacity under our credit facilities, will be sufficient to fund our required distributions, capital expenditures, debt service obligations (interest and principal repayments) and signed acquisitions. As of December 31, 2021, we had $1.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries, of which $292.4 million was held by our joint ventures. While certain subsidiaries may pay us interest or principal on intercompany debt, it has not been our practice to repatriate earnings from our foreign subsidiaries primarily due to our ongoing expansion efforts and related capital needs. However, in the event that we do repatriate any funds, we may be required to accrue and pay certain taxes. Cash Flows from Operating Activities For the year ended December 31, 2021, cash provided by operating activities increased $938.5 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The primary factors that impacted cash provided by operating activities as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, include: • An increase in our segment operating profit of $851.9 million, partially offset by an increase in acquisition related costs, primarily associated with the Telxius Acquisition and the CoreSite Acquisition; • An increase in unearned revenue due to advance payments from a customer; • An increase in non-cash operating activities, including an increase of approximately $143.6 million in straight-line revenue; • An increase in cash required for working capital, primarily as a result of an increase in prepaid and other assets; • An increase of approximately $78.9 million in cash paid for taxes; and • An increase of approximately $28.9 million in cash paid for interest. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Our significant investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2021 are highlighted below: • We spent approximately $19.3 billion for acquisitions, primarily related to the Telxius Acquisition and the CoreSite Acquisition, as well as asset acquisitions in the United States, Bangladesh, Chile, France, Mexico, Nigeria, Peru and Poland. • We spent $1.4 billion for capital expenditures, as follows (in millions): Discretionary capital projects (1) $ 516.4 Ground lease purchases (2) 237.5 Capital improvements and corporate expenditures (3) 178.4 Redevelopment 264.3 Start-up capital projects 211.2 Total capital expenditures (4) $ 1,407.8 _______________ (1) Includes the construction of 6,356 communications sites globally.

(4) Net of purchase credits of $9.5 million on certain assets, which are reported in operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. We plan to continue to allocate our available capital, after satisfying our distribution requirements, among investment alternatives that meet our return on investment criteria, while maintaining our commitment to our long-term financial policies. Accordingly, we expect to continue to deploy capital through our annual capital expenditure program, including land purchases 37 Table of Conten ts and new site and data center facility construction, and through acquisitions. We also regularly review our site portfolios as to capital expenditures required to upgrade our towers to our structural standards or address capacity, structural or permitting issues. We expect that our 2022 total capital expenditures will be as follows (in millions): Discretionary capital projects (1) $ 820 to $ 850 Ground lease purchases 230 to 250 Capital improvements and corporate expenditures 170 to 180 Redevelopment 500 to 520 Start-up capital projects 280 to 300 Total capital expenditures $ 2,000 to $ 2,100 _______________ (1) Includes the construction of approximately 6,000 to 7,000 communications sites globally.

The Notes rank equally with all of our other senior unsecured debt and are structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of our subsidiaries. The supplemental indentures contain certain covenants that restrict our ability to merge, consolidate or sell assets and our (together with our subsidiaries’) ability to incur liens. These covenants are subject to a number of exceptions, including that we and our subsidiaries may incur certain liens on assets, mortgages or other liens securing indebtedness if the aggregate amount of indebtedness secured by such liens does not exceed 3.5x Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the applicable supplemental indenture.

(together, “BofA”) pursuant to which BofA had, with respect to bridge financing, committed to provide up to 7.5 billion EUR (approximately $9.1 billion at the date of signing) in bridge loans (the “BofA Bridge Loan Commitment”) to ensure financing for the Telxius Acquisition. Effective February 10, 2021, the BofA Bridge Loan Commitment was reduced to 4.275 billion EUR (approximately $5.2 billion at the date of signing) as a result of an aggregate of 3.225 billion EUR (approximately $3.9 billion at the date of signing) of additional committed amounts under the 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility, the 2021 Credit Facility and the 2021 EUR Delayed Draw Term Loans, as described above.

Effective May 24, 2021, upon receipt of the proceeds from the issuance of the 0.450% Notes, the 0.875% Notes and the 1.250% Notes, we determined that we had adequate cash resources and undrawn availability under our revolving credit facilities and the 2021 EUR Delayed Draw Term Loans to 42 Table of Conten ts fund the cash consideration payable in connection with the Telxius Acquisition and terminated the BofA Commitment Letter. We did not make any borrowings under the BofA Bridge Loan Commitment.

(“JPM”) pursuant to which JPM had, with respect to bridge financing, committed to provide up to $10.5 billion in bridge loans (the “JPM Bridge Loan Commitment”) to ensure financing for the CoreSite Acquisition. Effective December 8, 2021, the JPM Bridge Loan Commitment was fully terminated as a result of the $10.5 billion in committed amounts available under the 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility, the 2021 Credit Facility, the 2021 Term Loan and the 2021 USD Delayed Draw Term Loans, as described above.

(2) Currently borrowed at LIBOR for USD denominated borrowings and at EURIBOR for EUR denominated borrowings. (3) Subject to two optional renewal periods. (4) Currently borrowed at LIBOR. (5) Currently borrowed at EURIBOR. We must pay a quarterly commitment fee on the undrawn portion of each of the 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility and the 2021 Credit Facility. The commitment fee for the 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility and the 2021 Credit Facility ranges from 0.080% to 0.300% per annum, based upon our debt ratings, and is currently 0.110%. The 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility, the 2021 Credit Facility, the 2021 Term Loan, the 2021 EUR Three Year Delayed Draw Term Loan, the 2021 USD 364-Day Delayed Draw Term Loan and the 2021 USD Two Year Delayed Draw Term Loan do not require amortization of principal and may be paid prior to maturity in whole or in part at our option without penalty or premium. We have the option of choosing either a defined base rate, LIBOR or EURIBOR as the applicable base rate for borrowings under these bank facilities. The loan agreements for each of the 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility, the 2021 Credit Facility, the 2021 Term Loan, the 2021 EUR Three Year Delayed Draw Term Loan, the 2021 USD 364-Day Delayed Draw Term Loan and the 2021 USD Two Year Delayed Draw Term Loan contain certain reporting, information, financial and operating covenants and other restrictions (including limitations on additional debt, guaranties, sales of assets and liens) with which we must comply. Failure to comply with the financial and operating covenants of the loan agreements could not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under the revolving credit facilities, but may constitute a default, which could result in, among other things, the amounts outstanding under the applicable agreement, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable. India Indebtedness— The India indebtedness includes several working capital facilities, most of which are subject to annual renewal, and an overdraft facility. The working capital facilities bear interest at rates that consist of the applicable bank’s Marginal Cost of Funds based Lending Rate (as defined in the applicable agreement), plus a spread. Generally, the working capital facilities are payable on demand prior to maturity. The overdraft facility bears interest at the Overnight Mumbai Inter-Bank Offer Rate at the time of borrowing plus a spread. As of December 31, 2021, we have not borrowed under these facilities. 43 Table of Conten ts Amounts outstanding and key terms of the India indebtedness consisted of the following as of December 31, 2021 (in millions, except percentages): Amount Outstanding (INR) Amount Outstanding (USD) Interest Rate (Range) Maturity Date (Range) Working capital facilities (1) — $ — 5.09% -8.75% February 4, 2022 - October 23, 2022 Overdraft facility (2) — $ — N/A September 14, 2022 _______________ (1) 7.70 billion INR ($103.5 million) of borrowing capacity as of December 31, 2021.

Repayment of CoreSite Debt —Debt assumed in connection with the CoreSite Acquisition included senior unsecured notes previously entered into by CoreSite (the “CoreSite Debt”). The CoreSite Debt was recorded at fair value upon the closing of the CoreSite Acquisition. On January 7, 2022, we repaid the entire amount outstanding under the CoreSite Debt, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, January 7, 2022, for an aggregate redemption price of $962.9 million, including $80.1 million of prepayment consideration and $7.8 million in accrued and unpaid interest. The repayment of the CoreSite Debt was funded with borrowings under the 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility and cash on hand. Stock Repurchase Programs —In March 2011, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program, pursuant to which we are authorized to repurchase up to $1.5 billion of our common stock (the “2011 Buyback”). In December 2017, our Board of Directors approved an additional stock repurchase program, pursuant to which we are authorized to repurchase up to $2.0 billion of our common stock (the “2017 Buyback,” and, together with the 2011 Buyback, the “Buyback Programs”). During the year ended December 31, 2021, we made no repurchases under either of the Buyback Programs. Under each program, we are authorized to purchase shares from time to time through open market purchases or in privately negotiated transactions not to exceed market prices and subject to market conditions and other factors. With respect to open market purchases, we may use plans adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act in accordance with securities laws and other legal requirements, which allows us to repurchase shares during periods when we may otherwise be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of self-imposed trading blackout periods. These programs may be discontinued at any time. We have repurchased a total of 14.4 million shares of our common stock under the 2011 Buyback for an aggregate of $1.5 billion, including commissions and fees. We expect to continue managing the pacing of the remaining approximately $2.0 billion under the Buyback Programs in response to general market conditions and other relevant factors. We expect to fund any further repurchases of our common stock through a combination of cash on hand, cash generated by operations and borrowings under our credit facilities. Repurchases under the Buyback Programs are subject to, among other things, us having available cash to fund the repurchases. Sales of Equity Securities —We receive proceeds from sales of our equity securities pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan (the “ESPP”) and upon exercise of stock options granted under our equity incentive plan, as amended (the “2007 Plan”). During the year ended December 31, 2021, we received an aggregate of $96.8 million in proceeds upon exercises of stock options and sales pursuant to the ESPP. 2020 “At the Market” Stock Offering Program —In August 2020, we established an “at the market” stock offering program through which we may issue and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $1.0 billion (the “2020 ATM Program”). Sales under the 2020 ATM Program may be made by means of ordinary brokers’ transactions on the New York Stock Exchange or otherwise at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to prevailing market prices or, subject to our specific instructions, at negotiated prices. We intend to use the net proceeds from any issuances under the 2020 ATM Program for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, the funding of acquisitions, additions to working capital and repayment or refinancing of existing indebtedness. As of December 31, 2021, we have not sold any shares of common stock under the 2020 ATM Program. Common Stock Offering — On May 10, 2021, we completed a registered public offering of 9,000,000 shares of our common stock, par value $0.01 per share, at $244.75 per share. On May 10, 2021, we issued an additional 900,000 shares of our common stock in connection with the underwriters’ exercise in full of their over-allotment option. Aggregate net proceeds from this offering were approximately $2.4 billion after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses. We used the net proceeds to finance the Telxius Acquisition. Distributions— As a REIT, we must annually distribute to our stockholders an amount equal to at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain). Generally, we have distributed, and expect to continue to distribute, all or substantially all of our REIT taxable income after taking into 44 Table of Conten ts consideration our utilization of NOLs. We have distributed an aggregate of approximately $11.8 billion to our common stockholders, including the dividend paid in January 2022, primarily classified as ordinary income that may be treated as qualified REIT dividends under Section 199A of the Code for taxable years ending before 2026. The amount, timing and frequency of future distributions will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on various factors, a number of which may be beyond our control, including our financial condition and operating cash flows, the amount required to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT and reduce any income and excise taxes that we otherwise would be required to pay, limitations on distributions in our existing and future debt and preferred equity instruments, our ability to utilize NOLs to offset our distribution requirements, limitations on our ability to fund distributions using cash generated through our TRSs and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we paid $5.03 per share, or $2.3 billion, to common stockholders of record. In addition, we declared a distribution of $1.39 per share, or $633.5 million, paid on January 14, 2022 to our common stockholders of record at the close of business on December 27, 2021. We accrue distributions on unvested restricted stock units, which are payable upon vesting. The amount accrued for distributions payable related to unvested restricted stock units was $12.8 million and $12.6 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we paid $7.5 million of distributions upon the vesting of restricted stock units. For more details on the cash distributions paid to our common stockholders during the year ended December 31, 2021, see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. Material Cash Requirements — The following table summarizes material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations as of December 31, 2021 (in millions): 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 Thereafter Total Debt obligations (1) $ 4,568.7 $ 4,512.7 $ 3,091.0 $ 8,134.5 $ 3,370.1 $ 19,820.5 $ 43,497.5 Operating lease obligations (2) 1,125.9 1,071.7 1,028.0 969.4 919.9 6,935.4 12,050.3 ______________ (1) Includes aggregate principal maturities of long-term debt, including finance lease obligations (see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report). (2) Includes payments under non-cancellable initial terms, as well as payments for certain renewal periods at our option, which we expect to renew because failure to do so could result in a loss of the applicable communications sites and related revenues from tenant leases (see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report). Distributions— We expect that our 2022 total distributions declared to our common stockholders will be $2.8 billion. The amount, timing and frequency of future distributions will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors. Signed Acquisitions— On November 28, 2019, we entered into definitive agreements with Orange for the acquisition of up to approximately 2,000 communications sites in France over a period of up to five years for total consideration in the range of approximately 500.0 million EUR to 600.0 million EUR (approximately $550.5 million to $660.5 million at the date of signing) to be paid over the five-year term. As of December 31, 2021, we have completed the acquisition of nearly 1,200 communications sites. The remaining communications sites are expected to close in tranches, subject to customary closing conditions. Asset Retirement Obligations— We are required to remove our assets and remediate the leased sites upon which certain of our assets are located. As of December 31, 2021, the estimated undiscounted future cash outlay for asset retirement obligations was $4.2 billion. Factors Affecting Sources of Liquidity Our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities, borrow funds under our credit facilities and maintain compliance with the contractual agreements governing our indebtedness. We believe that the debt agreements discussed below represent our material debt agreements that contain covenants, our compliance with which would be material to an investor’s understanding of our financial results and the impact of those results on our liquidity. Internally Generated Funds —Because the majority of our customer leases are multiyear contracts, a significant majority of the revenues generated by our property operations as of the end of 2021 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. Accordingly, a key factor affecting our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is to maintain this recurring revenue and to convert it into operating profit by minimizing operating costs and fully achieving our operating efficiencies. In addition, our ability to increase cash flow from operating activities depends upon the demand for our 45 Table of Conten ts communications infrastructure and our related services and our ability to increase the utilization of our existing communications infrastructure. Restrictions Under Loan Agreements Relating to Our Credit Facilities —The loan agreements for the 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility, the 2021 Credit Facility, the 2021 Term Loan, the 2021 EUR Three Year Delayed Draw Term Loan, the 2021 USD 364-Day Delayed Draw Term Loan and the 2021 USD Two Year Delayed Draw Term Loan contain certain financial and operating covenants and other restrictions applicable to us and our subsidiaries that are not designated as unrestricted subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. These restrictions include limitations on additional debt, distributions and dividends, guaranties, sales of assets and liens. The loan agreements also contain covenants that establish financial tests with which we and our restricted subsidiaries must comply related to total leverage and senior secured leverage, as set forth in the table below. As of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with each of these covenants. Compliance Tests For The 12 Months Ended December 31, 2021 ($ in billions) Ratio (1) Additional Debt Capacity Under Covenants (2) Capacity for Adjusted EBITDA Decrease Under Covenants (3) Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ≤ 7.50:1.00 ~$5.4 ~$0.7 Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio Senior Secured Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ≤ 3.00:1.00 ~$16.1 (4) ~$5.4 _______________ (1) Each component of the ratio as defined in the applicable loan agreement. (2) Assumes no change to Adjusted EBITDA. (3) Assumes no change to our debt levels. (4) Effectively, however, additional Senior Secured Debt under this ratio would be limited to the capacity under the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio. Under the terms of the agreements for the 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility, the 2021 Credit Facility, the 2021 Term Loan, the 2021 EUR Three Year Delayed Draw Term Loan, the 2021 USD 364-Day Delayed Draw Term Loan and the 2021 USD Two Year Delayed Draw Term Loan, the Telxius Acquisition and the CoreSite Acquisition are designated as a Qualified Acquisitions, whereby our Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio is adjusted to not exceed 7:50 to 1:00 for four fiscal quarters following consummation of the Telxius Acquisition, which began with the quarter ended June 30, 2021 and for four fiscal quarters following consummation of the CoreSite Acquisition, which began with the quarter ended December 31, 2021. The loan agreements for our credit facilities also contain reporting and information covenants that require us to provide financial and operating information to the lenders within certain time periods. If we are unable to provide the required information on a timely basis, we would be in breach of these covenants. Failure to comply with the financial maintenance tests and certain other covenants of the loan agreements for our credit facilities could not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under these credit facilities, but may also constitute a default under these credit facilities, which could result in, among other things, the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable. If this were to occur, we may not have sufficient cash on hand to repay such indebtedness. The key factors affecting our ability to comply with the debt covenants described above are our financial performance relative to the financial maintenance tests defined in the loan agreements for these credit facilities and our ability to fund our debt service obligations. Based upon our current expectations, we believe our operating results during the next 12 months will be sufficient to comply with these covenants. Restrictions Under Agreements Relating to the 2015 Securitization and the Trust Securitizations— The indenture and related supplemental indenture governing the American Tower Secured Revenue Notes, Series 2015-2, Class A (the “Series 2015-2 Notes”) issued by GTP Acquisition Partners I, LLC (“GTP Acquisition Partners”) in the 2015 Securitization and the loan agreement related to the Trust Securitizations include certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions customary for transactions subject to rated securitizations. Among other things, GTP Acquisition Partners and American Tower Asset Sub, LLC and American Tower Asset Sub II, LLC (together, the “AMT Asset Subs”) are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets, subject to customary carve-outs for ordinary course trade payables and permitted encumbrances (as defined in the applicable agreements). Under the agreements, amounts due will be paid from the cash flows generated by the assets securing the Series 2015-2 Notes or the assets securing the nonrecourse loan that secures the Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2013-2A (the “Series 2013-2A Securities”), Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2018-1, Subclass A (the “Series 2018-1A Securities”), and the Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2018-1, Subclass R (the “Series 2018-1R Securities” and, together with the Series 2018-1A Securities, the “2018 Securities”) issued in the Trust Securitizations (the “Loan”), as applicable, which must be deposited into certain reserve accounts, and thereafter distributed, solely pursuant to the terms of the applicable agreement. On a monthly basis, after payment of all required amounts under the applicable agreement, subject to the conditions described in the 46 Table of Conten ts table below, the excess cash flows generated from the operation of such assets are released to GTP Acquisition Partners or the AMT Asset Subs, as applicable, which can then be distributed to, and used by, us. As of December 31, 2021, $358.8 million held in such reserve accounts was classified as restricted cash. Certain information with respect to the 2015 Securitization and the Trust Securitizations is set forth below. The debt service coverage ratio (“DSCR”) is generally calculated as the ratio of the net cash flow (as defined in the applicable agreement) to the amount of interest, servicing fees and trustee fees required to be paid over the succeeding 12 months on the principal amount of the Series 2015-2 Notes or the Loan, as applicable, that will be outstanding on the payment date following such date of determination. Issuer or Borrower Notes/Securities Issued Conditions Limiting Distributions of Excess Cash Excess Cash Distributed During Year Ended December 31, 2021 DSCR as of December 31, 2021 Capacity for Decrease in Net Cash Flow Before Triggering Cash Trap DSCR (1) Capacity for Decrease in Net Cash Flow Before Triggering Minimum DSCR (1) Cash Trap DSCR Amortization Period (in millions) (in millions) (in millions) 2015 Securitization GTP Acquisition Partners American Tower Secured Revenue Notes, Series 2015-2 1.30x, Tested Quarterly (2) (3)(4) $303.1 15.10x $253.8 $256.6 Trust Securitizations AMT Asset Subs Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2013-2A, Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2018-1, Subclass A and Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2018-1, Subclass R 1.30x, Tested Quarterly (2) (3)(5) $534.9 10.04x $522.0 $530.9 _______________ (1) Based on the net cash flow of the applicable issuer or borrower as of December 31, 2021 and the expenses payable over the next 12 months on the Series 2015-2 Notes or the Loan, as applicable. (2) Once triggered, a Cash Trap DSCR condition continues to exist until the DSCR exceeds the Cash Trap DSCR for two consecutive calendar quarters. During a Cash Trap DSCR condition, all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments, fund required reserves, pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and make other payments required under the applicable transaction documents, referred to as excess cash flow, will be deposited into a reserve account (the “Cash Trap Reserve Account”) instead of being released to the applicable issuer or borrower. (3) An amortization period commences if the DSCR is equal to or below 1.15x (the “Minimum DSCR”) at the end of any calendar quarter and continues to exist until the DSCR exceeds the Minimum DSCR for two consecutive calendar quarters. (4) No amortization period is triggered if the outstanding principal amount of a series has not been repaid in full on the applicable anticipated repayment date. However, in such event, additional interest will accrue on the unpaid principal balance of the applicable series, and such series will begin to amortize on a monthly basis from excess cash flow. (5) An amortization period exists if the outstanding principal amount has not been paid in full on the applicable anticipated repayment date and continues to exist until such principal has been repaid in full. A failure to meet the noted DSCR tests could prevent GTP Acquisition Partners or the AMT Asset Subs from distributing excess cash flow to us, which could affect our ability to fund our capital expenditures, including tower construction and acquisitions and to meet REIT distribution requirements. During an “amortization period,” all excess cash flow and any amounts then in the applicable Cash Trap Reserve Account would be applied to pay the principal of the Series 2015-2 Notes or the Loan, as applicable, on each monthly payment date, and so would not be available for distribution to us. Further, additional interest will begin to accrue with respect to the Series 2015-2 Notes or subclass of the Loan from and after the anticipated repayment date at a per annum rate determined in accordance with the applicable agreement. With respect to the Series 2015-2 Notes, upon the occurrence of, and during, an event of default, the applicable trustee may, in its discretion or at the direction of holders of more than 50% of the aggregate outstanding principal of the Series 2015-2 Notes, declare the Series 2015-2 Notes immediately due and payable, in which case any excess cash flow would need to be used to pay holders of such notes. Furthermore, if GTP Acquisition Partners or the AMT Asset Subs were to default on the Series 2015-2 Notes or the Loan, the applicable trustee may seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of all or any portion of the 3,531 communications sites that secure the Series 2015-2 Notes or the 5,113 broadcast and wireless communications towers and 47 Table of Conten ts related assets that secure the Loan, respectively, in which case we could lose such sites and the revenue associated with those assets. As discussed above, we use our available liquidity and seek new sources of liquidity to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, satisfy our distribution requirements and repay or repurchase our debt. If we determine that it is desirable or necessary to raise additional capital, we may be unable to do so, or such additional financing may be prohibitively expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness. Further, as further discussed under Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption “Risk Factors,” extreme market volatility and disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may impact our ability to raise additional capital through debt financing activities or our ability to repay or refinance maturing liabilities, or impact the terms of any new obligations. If we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise, we may not be able to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, satisfy our REIT distribution requirements and debt service obligations or refinance our existing indebtedness. In addition, our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities. As set forth under Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption “Risk Factors,” we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and, consequently, a failure by a significant customer to perform its contractual obligations to us could adversely affect our cash flow and liquidity. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We have reviewed our policies and estimates to determine our critical accounting policies for the year ended December 31, 2021. We have identified the following policies as critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition. This is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies. See note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for a summary of our significant accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP, with no need for management’s judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result. • Impairment of Assets—Assets Subject to Depreciation and Amortization : We review long-lived assets for impairment at least annually or whenever events, changes in circumstances or other indicators or evidence indicate that the carrying amount of our assets may not be recoverable. We review our tower portfolio, network location intangible and right-of-use assets for indicators of impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, typically at an individual tower basis. Possible indicators include a tower not having current tenant leases or having expenses in excess of revenues. A cash flow modeling approach is utilized to assess recoverability and incorporates, among other items, the tower location, the tower location demographics, the timing of additions of new tenants, lease rates and estimated length of tenancy and ongoing cash requirements. We review our tenant-related intangible assets on a tenant by tenant basis for indicators of impairment, such as high levels of turnover or attrition, non-renewal of a significant number of contracts or the cancellation or termination of a relationship. We assess recoverability by determining whether the carrying amount of the tenant-related intangible assets will be recovered primarily through projected undiscounted future cash flows. If the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of our long-lived assets is less than the carrying amount of the assets, an impairment loss may be recognized. Key assumptions included in the undiscounted cash flows are future revenue projections, estimates of ongoing tenancies and operating margins. An impairment loss would be based on the fair value of the asset, which is based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows to be provided from the asset. We record any related impairment charge in the period in which we identify such impairment. In October 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued a ruling regarding the definition of AGR and associated fees and charges, which was reaffirmed in March 2020, that may have a material financial impact on certain of our tenants which could affect their ability to perform their obligations under agreements with us. In September 2020, the Supreme Court of India defined the expected timeline of ten years for payments owed under the ruling. In September 2021, the government in India approved a relief package, that, among other things, included (i) a four year moratorium on the payment of AGR fees owed and (ii) a change in the definition of AGR on a prospective basis. We will continue to 48 Table of Conten ts monitor the status of these developments, as it is possible that the estimated future cash flows may differ from current estimates and changes in estimated cash flows from tenants in India could have an impact on previously recorded tangible and intangible assets, including amounts originally recorded as tenant-related intangibles. The carrying value of tenant-related intangibles in India was $0.9 billion as of December 31, 2021, which represents 6% of our consolidated balance of $15.0 billion. Additionally, a significant reduction in tenant related cash flows in India could also impact our tower portfolio and network location intangibles. The carrying values of our tower portfolio and network location intangibles in India were $1.0 billion and $367.4 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2021, which represent 12% and 9% of our consolidated balances of $9.0 billion and $4.0 billion, respectively. • Impairment of Assets—Goodwill: We review goodwill for impairment at least annually (as of December 31) or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill is recorded in the applicable segment and assessed for impairment at the reporting unit level. We employ a discounted cash flow analysis when testing goodwill. The key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance, terminal sales growth rate, management’s expectations of future operating results and cash requirements, the current weighted average cost of capital and an expected tax rate. We compare the fair value of the reporting unit, as calculated under an income approach using future discounted cash flows, to the carrying amount of the applicable reporting unit. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount of the excess. The loss recognized is limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. During the year ended December 31, 2021, no potential goodwill impairment was identified as the fair value of each of our reporting units was in excess of its carrying amount. • Acquisitions : We evaluate each of our acquisitions under the accounting guidance framework to determine whether to treat an acquisition as an asset acquisition or a business combination. For those transactions treated as asset acquisitions, the purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired, with no recognition of goodwill. For those acquisitions that meet the definition of a business combination, we apply the acquisition method of accounting where assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value at the date of each acquisition, and the results of operations are included with our results from the dates of the respective acquisitions. Any excess of the purchase price paid over the amounts recognized for assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. We continue to evaluate acquisitions accounted for as business combinations for a period not to exceed one year after the applicable acquisition date of each transaction to determine whether any additional adjustments are needed to the allocation of the purchase price paid for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is typically determined by using either estimates of replacement costs or discounted cash flow valuation methods. When determining the fair value of tangible assets acquired, we must estimate the cost to replace the asset with a new asset taking into consideration such factors as age, condition and the economic useful life of the asset. When determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired, we must estimate the applicable discount rate and the timing and amount of future tenant cash flows, including rate and terms of renewal and attrition. • Revenue Recognition: Our revenue is derived from leasing the right to use our communications sites, the land on which the sites are located and our data center facilities (the “lease component”) and from the reimbursement of costs incurred in operating the communications sites and supporting the tenants’ equipment as well as other services and contractual rights (the “non-lease component”). Most of our revenue is derived from leasing arrangements and is accounted for as lease revenue unless the timing and pattern of revenue recognition of the non-lease component differs from the lease component. If the timing and pattern of the non-lease component revenue recognition differs from that of the lease component, we separately determine the stand-alone selling prices and pattern of revenue recognition for each performance obligation. Our revenue from leasing arrangements, including fixed escalation clauses present in non-cancellable lease arrangements, is reported on a straight-line basis over the term of the respective leases when collectibility is probable. Escalation clauses tied to a consumer price index or other inflation-based indices, and other incentives present in lease agreements with our tenants, are excluded from the straight-line calculation. Total property straight-line revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were $465.6 million, $322.0 million and $183.5 million, respectively. Amounts billed upfront in connection with the execution of lease agreements are initially deferred and reflected in Unearned revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and recognized as revenue over the terms of the applicable lease arrangements. Amounts billed or received for services prior to being earned are deferred and reflected in Unearned revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets until the criteria for recognition have been met. 49 Table of Conten ts We derive the largest portion of our revenues, corresponding trade receivables and the related deferred rent asset from a small number of tenants in the telecommunications industry, with 52% of our revenues derived from three tenants. In addition, we have concentrations of credit risk in certain geographic areas. We mitigate the concentrations of credit risk with respect to notes and trade receivables by actively monitoring the creditworthiness of our borrowers and tenants. In recognizing tenant revenue we assess the collectibility of both the amounts billed and the portion recognized on a straight-line basis. This assessment takes tenant credit risk and business and industry conditions into consideration to ultimately determine the collectibility of the amounts billed. To the extent the amounts, based on management’s estimates, may not be collectible, recognition is deferred until such point as the uncertainty is resolved. Any amounts that were previously recognized as revenue and are subsequently determined to present a risk of collection are reserved as bad debt expense. Accounts receivable are reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts related to estimated losses resulting from a tenant’s inability to make required payments and allowances for amounts invoiced whose collectibility is not reasonably assured. • Rent Expense and Lease Accounting: Many of the leases underlying our tower sites and data centers have fixed rent escalations, which provide for periodic increases in the amount of ground rent payable over time. In addition, certain of our tenant leases require us to exercise available renewal options pursuant to the underlying ground lease if the tenant exercises its renewal option. Our calculation of the lease liability includes the term of the underlying ground lease plus all periods, if any, for which failure to renew the lease imposes an economic penalty to us such that renewal appears to be reasonably assured. We recognize a right-of-use lease asset and lease liability for operating and finance leases. The right-of-use asset is measured as the sum of the lease liability, prepaid or accrued lease payments, any initial direct costs incurred and any other applicable amounts. The calculation of the lease liability requires us to make certain assumptions for each lease, including lease term and discount rate implicit in each lease, which could significantly impact the gross lease obligation, the duration and the present value of the lease liability. When calculating the lease term, we consider the renewal, cancellation and termination rights available to us and the lessor. We determine the discount rate by calculating the incremental borrowing rate on a collateralized basis at the commencement of a lease or upon a change in the lease term. • Income Taxes: Accounting for income taxes requires us to estimate the timing and impact of amounts recorded in our financial statements that may be recognized differently for tax purposes. To the extent that the timing of amounts recognized for financial reporting purposes differs from the timing of recognition for tax reporting purposes, deferred tax assets or liabilities are required to be recorded. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. We do not expect to pay federal income taxes on our REIT taxable income. We periodically review our deferred tax assets, and we record a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets. Valuation allowances would be reversed as a reduction to the provision for income taxes, if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based on changes in facts and circumstances relevant to the assets’ recoverability. We recognize the benefit of uncertain tax positions when, in management’s judgment, it is more likely than not that positions we have taken in our tax returns will be sustained upon examination, which are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. We adjust our tax liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information or information not previously available. Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which additional information is available or the position is ultimately settled under audit.

(e) Represents the weighted average variable rate of interest based on contractual notional amount as a percentage of total notional amounts. Interest Rate Risk As of December 31, 2021, we had three interest rate swap agreements related to the 2.250% Notes. These swaps were designated as fair value hedges, had an aggregate notional amount of $600.0 million, had an interest rate of one-month LIBOR plus applicable spreads and expired in January 2022. The 2.250% Notes were subsequently repaid in full on January 14, 2022. In addition, we have three interest rate swap agreements related to a portion of our 3.000% senior unsecured notes due 2023 (the “3.000% Notes”). These swaps have been designated as fair value hedges, have an aggregate notional amount of $500.0 million, have an interest rate of one-month LIBOR plus applicable spreads and expire in June 2023. Changes in interest rates can cause interest charges to fluctuate on our variable rate debt. Variable rate debt as of December 31, 2021 consisted of $4.4 billion under the 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility, $1.4 billion under the 2021 Credit Facility, $1.0 billion under the 2021 Term Loan, $938.2 million under the 2021 EUR Three Year Delayed Draw Term Loan, $3.0 billion under the 2021 USD 364-Day Delayed Draw Term Loan, $1.5 billion under the 2021 USD Two Year Delayed Draw Term Loan, $600.0 million under the interest rate swap agreements related to the 2.250% Notes and $500.0 million under the interest rate swap agreements related to the 3.000% Notes. A 10% increase in current interest rates would result in an additional $16.3 million of interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021. Foreign Currency Risk We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily in connection with our foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures internationally. Any transaction denominated in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar is reported in U.S. Dollars at the applicable exchange rate. All assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. Dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of the applicable fiscal reporting period and all revenues and expenses are translated at average rates for the period. The cumulative translation effect is included in equity as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We may enter into additional foreign currency financial instruments in anticipation of future transactions to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. For the year ended December 31, 2021, 44% of our revenues and 52% of our total operating expenses were denominated in foreign currencies. 51 Table of Conten ts As of December 31, 2021, we have incurred intercompany debt that is not considered to be permanently reinvested, and similar unaffiliated balances that were denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the subsidiary in which it is recorded. As this debt had not been designated as being a long-term investment in nature, any changes in the foreign currency exchange rates will result in unrealized gains or losses, which will be included in our determination of net income. An adverse change of 10% in the underlying exchange rates of our unsettled intercompany debt and similar unaffiliated balances would result in $66.7 million of unrealized losses that would be included in Other expense in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, we have 7.3 billion EUR (approximately $8.3 billion) denominated debt outstanding. An adverse change of 10% in the underlying exchange rates of our outstanding EUR debt would result in $0.9 billion of foreign currency losses that would be included in Other expense in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021. ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA See Item 15 (a). ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures We have established disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that material information relating to us, including our consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to the officers who certify our financial reports and to other members of senior management and the Board of Directors. Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2021 and designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the requisite time periods specified in the applicable rules and forms, and that it is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 52 Table of Conten ts Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021. As discussed in Item 1 of this Annual Report under the caption “Business” and in note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report, we completed the Telxius Acquisition in June 2021 and August 2021 and the CoreSite Acquisition in December 2021. As permitted by the rules and regulations of the SEC, we excluded from our assessment the internal control over financial reporting at (i) Telxius, whose financial statements reflect total assets and revenues constituting 17% and 4%, respectively, of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of, and for the year ended, December 31, 2021, and (ii) CoreSite, whose financial statements reflect total assets and revenues constituting 16% and 0%, respectively, of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of, and for the year ended, December 31, 2021. In making its assessment of internal control over financial reporting, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) . Based on this assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2021, our internal control over financial reporting is effective. Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm that audited our financial statements included in this Annual Report, has issued an attestation report on management’s internal control over financial reporting, which is included in this Item 9A under the caption “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm.” Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2021 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. As set forth above, we excluded from our assessment the internal control over financial reporting at Telxius and CoreSite for the year ended December 31, 2021. We consider Telxius and CoreSite material to our results of operations, financial position and cash flows, and we are in the process of integrating the internal control procedures of Telxius and CoreSite into our internal control structure. 53 Table of Conten ts REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of American Tower Corporation Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of American Tower Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021, of the Company and our report dated February 24, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. As described in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at Telxius Telecom, S.A., which was acquired in June and August 2021 and whose financial statements constitute 17% of total assets and 4% of total revenues of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021. Management also excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at CoreSite Realty Corporation which was acquired in December 2021 and whose financial statements constitute 16% of total assets and 0% of total revenues of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at Telxius or CoreSite. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP Boston, Massachusetts February 24, 2022 ITEM 9C.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 24, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Telxius Acquisition – Refer to Notes 1, 5 and 6 to the financial statements Critical Audit Matter Description The Company completed the Telxius Acquisition (as defined in note 6 to the financial statements) in two closings during June and August 2021 for the total consideration of $9.6 billion. The Company accounted for the Telxius Acquisition under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. Accordingly, the purchase price was allocated on a preliminary basis to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values on the acquisition date including property, plant & equipment of $1,415 million, intangible assets of $6,043 million, a deferred tax liability of $1,195 million and goodwill of $3,517 million. Of the identified intangible assets acquired, the most significant judgements used were in the valuation of tenant relationship intangible assets of $5,371 million and network location intangible assets of $672 million. The Company estimated the fair value of these two intangible assets using the multi-period excess earnings method, which is a discounted cash flow method that required the Company to make significant estimates and assumptions related to future cash flows, including those related to tenant growth rates, and discount rate. We identified the valuation of the tenant relationship and network location intangible assets for the Telxius Acquisition as a critical audit matter because of the significant estimates and assumptions the Company makes to calculate the fair value of these assets for purposes of recording the acquisition. This required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of F-2 Table of Conten ts effort when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of the Company’s forecasts of future cash flows as well as the selection of the tenant growth rates and discount rates, including the need to involve our fair value specialists. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our principal audit procedures related to the forecasts of future cash flows for the intangible assets and the selection of the tenant growth rates and discount rates included the following, among others: • We tested the effectiveness of controls over the purchase price allocation, including controls over the Company’s projections of future cash flows and the selection of tenant growth rates and discount rates utilized in determining the fair value of the intangible assets. • We evaluated the reasonableness of the Company’s projections of future cash flows, including the selection of tenant growth rates by comparing the assumptions used in the projections to those of the in-place lease contracts assumed, external market sources, historical data of the Company’s similar contractual relationships, internal communications to management and the Board of Directors, and results from other areas of the audit. • With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the valuation methodology, tenant growth rates and discount rates by: ◦ Testing the source information underlying the determination of the tenant growth rates and discount rates and testing the mathematical accuracy of the calculations. ◦ Developing a range of independent estimates for the tenant growth rates and discount rates and comparing those to the rates selected by the Company. • We evaluated the adequacy of the Company’s disclosures in the financial statements related to the acquisition. /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP Boston, Massachusetts February 24, 2022 We have served as the Company’s auditor since 1997.

F-8 Table of Conten ts 1. BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Business —American Tower Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, “ATC” or the “Company”) is one of the largest global real estate investment trusts and a leading independent owner, operator and developer of multitenant communications real estate. The Company’s primary business is the leasing of space on communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, wireless data providers, government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries. The Company refers to this business as its property operations. Additionally, the Company offers tower-related services in the United States, which the Company refers to as its services operations. These services include site application, zoning and permitting (“AZP”) and structural analysis, which primarily support the Company’s site leasing business, including the addition of new tenants and equipment on its sites. The Company’s customers include its tenants, licensees and other payers. The Company’s portfolio primarily consists of towers that it owns and towers that it operates pursuant to long-term lease arrangements, as well as distributed antenna system (“DAS”) networks, which provide seamless coverage solutions in certain in-building and outdoor wireless environments. In addition to the communications sites in its portfolio, the Company manages rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements. The Company also holds other telecommunications infrastructure, fiber and property interests that it leases primarily to communications service providers and third-party tower operators and holds a portfolio of highly interconnected data center facilities and related assets in the United States that the Company leases primarily to enterprises, network operators, cloud providers and supporting service providers. American Tower Corporation is a holding company that conducts its operations through its directly and indirectly owned subsidiaries and joint ventures. ATC’s principal domestic operating subsidiaries are American Towers LLC and SpectraSite Communications, LLC. ATC conducts its international operations primarily through its subsidiary, American Tower International, Inc., which in turn conducts operations through its various international holding and operating subsidiaries and joint ventures. The Company operates as a real estate investment trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes (“REIT”). Accordingly, the Company generally is not required to pay U.S. federal income taxes on income generated by its REIT operations, including the income derived from leasing space on its towers and in its data centers, as it receives a dividends paid deduction for distributions to stockholders that generally offsets its REIT income and gains. However, the Company remains obligated to pay U.S. federal income taxes on earnings from its domestic taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRSs”). In addition, the Company’s international assets and operations, regardless of their classification for U.S. tax purposes, continue to be subject to taxation in the jurisdictions where those assets are held or those operations are conducted. The use of TRSs enables the Company to continue to engage in certain businesses and jurisdictions while complying with REIT qualification requirements. The Company may, from time to time, change the election of previously designated TRSs to be included as part of the REIT. As of December 31, 2021, the Company’s REIT-qualified businesses included its U.S. tower leasing business, a majority of its U.S. indoor DAS networks business, its Services and Data Centers segments, as well as most of its operations in Canada, Costa Rica, France, Germany, Mexico and Nigeria. In January 2022, a majority of the Company’s operations in Ghana, Kenya, South Africa and Uganda became part of the REIT. Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation —The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and those entities in which it has a controlling interest. Investments in entities that the Company does not control are accounted for using the equity method or as investments in equity securities, depending upon the Company’s ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. As of December 31, 2021, the Company holds (i) a 52 % controlling interest in subsidiaries whose holdings consist of the Company’s operations in France, Germany, Poland and Spain (such subsidiaries collectively, “ATC Europe”) (Allianz and CDPQ (each as defined in note 16) hold the noncontrolling interests) and (ii) a 51 % controlling interest in a joint venture whose holdings consist of the Company’s operations in Bangladesh (Confidence Tower Holdings Ltd. (“Confidence Group”) holds the noncontrolling interest). As of December 31, 2021, ATC Europe holds an 87 % and an 83 % controlling interest in subsidiaries that consist of the Company’s operations in Germany and Spain, respectively (PGGM holds the noncontrolling interests). See note 16 for a discussion of changes to the Company’s noncontrolling interests during the year ended December 31, 2021. Change in Reportable Segments —During the fourth quarter of 2021, as a result of the Company’s acquisition of CoreSite Realty Corporation (“CoreSite,” and the acquisition, the “CoreSite Acquisition”), the Company updated its reportable segments to add a Data Centers segment. The Data Centers segment is within the Company’s property operations. The Company will now report its results in seven segments – U.S. & Canada property (which includes all assets in the United States and Canada, F-9 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) other than the Company’s data center facilities and related assets), Asia-Pacific property, Africa property, Europe property, Latin America property, Data Centers and Services, which are discussed further in note 21. The change in reportable segments had no impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements for any prior periods. Historical financial information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K has not been adjusted as the amounts attributable to data center assets were insignificant as prior to the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company owned one data center. Significant Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates —The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results may differ from those estimates, and such differences could be material to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The significant estimates in the accompanying consolidated financial statements include impairment of long-lived assets (including goodwill), revenue recognition, rent expense and lease accounting, income taxes and accounting for business combinations and acquisitions of assets. The Company considers events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued as additional evidence for certain estimates or to identify matters that require additional disclosure. Accounts Receivable and Deferred Rent Asset —The Company derives the largest portion of its revenues and corresponding accounts receivable and the related deferred rent asset from a relatively small number of customers in the telecommunications industry, and 52 % of its current-year revenues are derived from three customers. The Company’s deferred rent asset is associated with non-cancellable tenant leases that contain fixed escalation clauses over the terms of the applicable lease in which revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company mitigates its concentrations of credit risk with respect to notes and trade receivables and the related deferred rent assets by actively monitoring the creditworthiness of its borrowers and customers. In recognizing customer revenue, the Company assesses the collectibility of both the amounts billed and the portion recognized in advance of billing on a straight-line basis. This assessment takes customer credit risk and business and industry conditions into consideration to ultimately determine the collectibility of the amounts billed. To the extent the amounts, based on management’s estimates, may not be collectible, revenue recognition is deferred until such point as collectibility is determined to be reasonably assured. Any amounts that were previously recognized as revenue and are subsequently determined to present a risk of collection are reserved as bad debt expense included in Selling, general, administrative and development expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Accounts receivable is reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts related to estimated losses resulting from a customer’s inability to make required payments and allowances for amounts invoiced whose collectibility is not reasonably assured. These allowances are generally estimated based on payment patterns, days past due and collection history, and incorporate changes in economic conditions that may not be reflected in historical trends, such as customers in bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization. Receivables are written-off against the allowances or reserves when they are determined to be uncollectible. Such determination includes analysis and consideration of the particular conditions of the account. Changes in the allowances were as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2021 2020 (1) 2019 Balance as of January 1, $ 247.6 $ 163.3 $ 282.4 Current year increases 130.9 105.6 104.3 Write-offs, recoveries and other (2) ( 22.6 ) ( 21.3 ) ( 223.4 ) Balance as of December 31, $ 355.9 $ 247.6 $ 163.3 _______________ (1) Year ended December 31, 2020 reflects the Company’s adoption of the current expected credit loss model for non-lease receivables. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements as the majority of the Company’s revenue is derived from its property operations and operating lease receivables are not within the scope of this guidance. (2) Amounts are primarily related to uncollectible amounts in India. Functional Currency —The functional currency of each of the Company’s foreign operating subsidiaries is normally the respective local currency, except for Costa Rica and Argentina, where the functional currency is the U.S. Dollar. All foreign currency assets and liabilities held by the subsidiaries are translated into U.S. Dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the end of the applicable fiscal reporting period and all foreign currency revenues and expenses are translated at the average monthly exchange rates. Translation adjustments are reflected in equity as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss F-10 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) (“AOCL”) in the consolidated balance sheets and included as a component of Comprehensive income in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Gains and losses on foreign currency transactions are reflected in Other expense in the consolidated statements of operations. However, the effect from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on intercompany debt for which repayment is not anticipated in the foreseeable future is reflected in AOCL in the consolidated balance sheets and included as a component of Comprehensive income. The Company recorded the following net foreign currency (gains) losses: Year Ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 Foreign currency losses recorded in AOCL $ 466.5 $ 391.0 $ 45.8 Foreign currency (gains) losses recorded in Other expense ( 557.9 ) 216.4 ( 6.1 ) Total foreign currency (gains) losses $ ( 91.4 ) $ 607.4 $ 39.7 Cash and Cash Equivalents —Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, demand deposits and short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less. The Company maintains its deposits at high-quality financial institutions and monitors the credit ratings of those institutions. Restricted Cash— Restricted cash includes cash pledged as collateral to secure obligations and all cash whose use is otherwise limited by contractual provisions. The reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash reported within the applicable balance sheet that sum to the total of the same such amounts shown in the statements of cash flows is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,949.9 $ 1,746.3 $ 1,501.2 Restricted cash 393.4 115.1 76.8 Total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 2,343.3 $ 1,861.4 $ 1,578.0 The increase in restricted cash during the year ended December 31, 2021 is due to advance payments from a customer. Property and Equipment —Property and equipment is recorded at cost or, in the case of acquired properties, at estimated fair value on the date acquired. Cost for self-constructed sites includes direct materials and labor and certain indirect costs associated with construction of the site, such as transportation costs, employee benefits and payroll taxes. The Company begins the capitalization of costs during the pre-construction period, which is the period during which costs are incurred to evaluate the site, and continues to capitalize costs until the site is substantially completed and ready for occupancy by a customer. Labor and related costs capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were $ 59.4 million, $ 51.1 million and $ 48.3 million, respectively. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Augmentation and improvements that extend an asset’s useful life or enhance capacity are capitalized. Depreciation expense is recorded using the straight-line method over the assets’ estimated useful lives. Towers and assets on leased land are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the term of the corresponding ground lease, taking into consideration lease renewal options and residual value. Towers or assets acquired through finance leases are recorded net at the present value of future minimum lease payments or the fair value of the leased asset at the inception of the lease. Property and equipment and assets held under finance leases are amortized over the shorter of the applicable lease term or the estimated useful life of the respective assets for periods generally not exceeding twenty years . The Company reviews its asset portfolio for indicators of impairment on an individual site basis. Impairments primarily result from a site not having current tenant leases or from having expenses in excess of revenues. The Company reviews other long-lived assets for impairment whenever events, changes in circumstances or other evidence indicate that the carrying amount of the Company’s assets may not be recoverable. The Company records impairment charges, which are discussed in note 17, in F-11 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) Other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the Company identifies such impairment. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets —The Company reviews goodwill for impairment at least annually (as of December 31) or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill is recorded in the applicable segment and assessed for impairment at the reporting unit level. The Company employs a discounted cash flow analysis when testing goodwill for impairment. The key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance, terminal sales growth rate, management’s expectations of future operating results and cash requirements, the current weighted average cost of capital and an expected tax rate. The Company compares the fair value of the reporting unit, as calculated under an income approach using future discounted cash flows, to the carrying amount of the applicable reporting unit. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount of the excess. The loss recognized is limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, no potential impairment was identified, as the fair value of each of the reporting units was in excess of its carrying amount. Intangible assets that are separable from goodwill and are deemed to have a definite life are amortized over their useful lives, generally ranging from three to twenty years and are evaluated separately for impairment at least annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The Company reviews its network location intangible assets for indicators of impairment on an individual tower basis. Impairments primarily result from a site not having current tenant leases or from having expenses in excess of revenues. The Company monitors its tenant-related intangible assets on a tenant by tenant basis for indicators of impairment, such as high levels of turnover or attrition, non-renewal of a significant number of contracts or the cancellation or termination of a relationship. The Company assesses recoverability by determining whether the carrying amount of the related assets will be recovered primarily through projected undiscounted future cash flows. If the Company determines that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, the Company measures any impairment loss based on the projected future discounted cash flows to be provided from the asset or available market information relative to the asset’s fair value, as compared to the asset’s carrying amount. The Company records impairment charges, which are discussed in note 17, in Other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the Company identifies such impairment. Derivative Financial Instruments —Derivatives are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value. If a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in AOCL, as well as a component of comprehensive income, and are recognized in the results of operations when the hedged item affects earnings. Changes in fair value of the ineffective portions of cash flow hedges are recognized in the results of operations. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, changes in value of the derivatives are recorded in Other expense in the consolidated statements of operations in the current period, along with the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. For derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognized in the results of operations in the period that the change occurs. The primary risks managed through the use of derivative instruments is interest rate risk, exposure to changes in the fair value of debt attributable to interest rate risk and currency risk. From time to time, the Company enters into interest rate swap agreements or foreign currency contracts to manage exposure to these risks. Under these agreements, the Company is exposed to counterparty credit risk to the extent that a counterparty fails to meet the terms of a contract. The Company’s exposure is limited to the current value of the contract at the time the counterparty fails to perform. The Company assesses, both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows or fair values of hedged items. The Company does not hold derivatives for trading purposes. Fair Value Measurements —The Company determines the fair value of its financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Asset Retirement Obligations —When required, the Company recognizes the fair value of obligations to remove its assets and remediate the leased space upon which certain of its assets are located. Generally, the associated retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related assets and depreciated over their estimated useful lives and the liability is accreted through the obligation’s estimated settlement date. Fair value estimates of asset retirement obligations generally involve discounting of estimated future cash flows associated with remediation costs. Periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is included in Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense in the consolidated statements of operations. F-12 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) Adjustments are also made to the asset retirement obligation liability to reflect changes in the estimates of timing and amount of expected cash flows, with an offsetting adjustment made to the related long-lived tangible asset. The significant assumptions used in estimating the Company’s aggregate asset retirement obligation are: timing of asset removals; cost of asset removals; timing and number of site lease renewals; expected inflation rates; and credit-adjusted, risk-free interest rates that approximate the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. Income Taxes —As a REIT, the Company generally is not subject to U.S. federal income taxes on income generated by its REIT operations as it receives a dividends paid deduction for distributions to stockholders that generally offsets its REIT income and gains. However, the Company remains obligated to pay U.S. federal income taxes on certain earnings and continues to be subject to taxation in its foreign jurisdictions. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements reflect provisions for federal, state, local and foreign income taxes. The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The Company measures deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company periodically reviews its deferred tax assets, and provides valuation allowances if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets. Valuation allowances would be reversed as a reduction to the provision for income taxes if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based on changes in facts and circumstances relevant to the assets’ recoverability. The Company estimates the liabilities from uncertain tax positions, which are recorded in Other non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet, unless expected to be paid within one year. The Company reports penalties and tax-related interest expense as a component of the income tax provision and interest income from tax refunds as a component of Interest income in the consolidated statements of operations. Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) —Other comprehensive income (loss) refers to items excluded from net income that are recorded as an adjustment to equity, net of tax. The Company’s other comprehensive income (loss) primarily consisted of changes in fair value of effective derivative cash flow hedges, foreign currency translation adjustments and reclassification of unrealized losses on effective derivative cash flow hedges. The AOCL balance included accumulated foreign currency translation losses of $ 4.7 billion, $ 3.8 billion and $ 2.8 billion as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Distributions —As a REIT, the Company must annually distribute to its stockholders an amount equal to at least 90% of its REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain). Generally, the Company has distributed, and expects to continue to distribute, all or substantially all of its REIT taxable income after taking into consideration its utilization of net operating losses (“NOLs”). The amount, timing and frequency of future distributions will be at the sole discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend upon various factors, a number of which may be beyond the Company’s control, including the Company’s financial condition and operating cash flows, the amount required to maintain its qualification for taxation as a REIT and reduce any income and excise taxes that the Company otherwise would be required to pay, limitations on distributions in the Company’s existing and future debt and preferred equity instruments, the Company’s ability to utilize NOLs to offset the Company’s distribution requirements, limitations on its ability to fund distributions using cash generated through its TRSs and other factors that the Board of Directors may deem relevant. Acquisitions —For acquisitions that meet the definition of a business combination, the Company applies the acquisition method of accounting where assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value at the date of each acquisition, and the results of operations are included with those of the Company from the dates of the respective acquisitions. Any excess of the purchase price paid by the Company over the amounts recognized for assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. The Company continues to evaluate acquisitions for a period not to exceed one year after the applicable acquisition date of each transaction to determine whether any additional adjustments are needed to the allocation of the purchase price paid for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. All other acquisitions are accounted for as asset acquisitions and the purchase price is allocated to the net assets acquired with no recognition of goodwill. The purchase price is not subsequently adjusted. The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is typically determined by using either estimates of replacement costs or discounted cash flow valuation methods. When determining the fair value of tangible assets acquired, the Company must estimate the cost to replace the asset with a new asset taking into consideration such factors as age, condition and the F-13 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) economic useful life and productive capacity of the asset. When determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the Company must estimate the applicable discount rate and the timing and amount of future cash flows, including rate and terms of renewal and attrition. Revenue —The Company’s revenue is derived from leasing the right to use its communications sites, the land on which the sites are located and its data center facilities (the “lease component”) and from the reimbursement of costs incurred by the Company in operating the communications sites and data center facilities and supporting its customers’ equipment as well as other services and contractual rights (the “non-lease component”). Most of the Company’s revenue is derived from leasing arrangements and is accounted for as lease revenue unless the timing and pattern of revenue recognition of the non-lease component differs from the lease component. If the timing and pattern of the non-lease component revenue recognition differs from that of the lease component, the Company separately determines the stand-alone selling prices and pattern of revenue recognition for each performance obligation. Revenue related to DAS networks and fiber and other related assets results from agreements with tenants are generally not accounted for as leases. The Company’s revenue from leasing arrangements, including fixed escalation clauses present in non-cancellable lease arrangements, is reported on a straight-line basis over the term of the respective leases when collectibility is probable. Escalation clauses tied to a consumer price index (“CPI”), or other inflation-based indices, and other incentives present in lease agreements with the Company’s tenants are excluded from the straight-line calculation. Total property straight-line revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were $ 465.6 million, $ 322.0 million and $ 183.5 million, respectively. Non-lease property revenue— Non-lease property revenue consists primarily of revenue generated from DAS networks, fiber and other property related revenue. DAS networks and fiber arrangements generally require that the Company provide the tenant the right to use available capacity on the applicable communications infrastructure. Performance obligations are satisfied over time for the duration of the arrangements. Non-lease property revenue also includes revenue generated from interconnection services in the Company’s data center facilities. Interconnection services are generally contracted on a month-to-month basis and are cancellable by the Company or the data center customer at any time. Performance obligations are satisfied over time for the duration of the arrangements. Other property related revenue streams, which include site inspections, are not material on either an individual or consolidated basis. Services revenue— The Company offers tower-related services in the United States. These services include AZP and structural analysis. There is a single performance obligation related to AZP and revenue is recognized over time based on milestones achieved, which are determined based on costs expected to be incurred. Structural analysis services may have more than one performance obligation, contingent upon the number of contracted services. Revenue is recognized at the point in time the services are completed. Some of the Company’s contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations. For these arrangements, the Company allocates revenue to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price, which is typically based on the price charged to customers. Since most of the Company’s contracts are leases, costs to enter into lease arrangements are capitalized under the applicable lease accounting guidance. Costs incurred to obtain non-lease contracts that are capitalized primarily relate to DAS networks and are not material to the consolidated financial statements. The Company has excluded sales tax, value added tax and similar taxes from non-lease revenue. Revenue is disaggregated by geography in a manner consistent with the Company’s business segments, which are discussed further in note 21. A summary of revenue disaggregated by source and geography is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2021 U.S. & Canada Asia-Pacific Africa Europe Latin America Data Centers (1) Total Non-lease property revenue $ 291.9 $ 8.8 $ 24.4 $ 7.6 $ 135.9 $ 1.3 $ 469.9 Services revenue 247.3 — — — — — 247.3 Total non-lease revenue $ 539.2 $ 8.8 $ 24.4 $ 7.6 $ 135.9 $ 1.3 $ 717.2 Property lease revenue 4,628.3 1,190.3 981.1 488.6 1,329.5 21.9 8,639.7 Total revenue $ 5,167.5 $ 1,199.1 $ 1,005.5 $ 496.2 $ 1,465.4 $ 23.2 $ 9,356.9 _______________ (1) Data Centers consists of the Company’s data center facilities located in the United States.

The Company records unearned revenue when payments are received from customers in advance of the completion of the Company’s performance obligations. Long-term unearned revenue is included in Other non-current liabilities. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recognized $ 169.3 million of revenue that was previously included in the contract liabilities balances, primarily arising from balances as of December 31, 2020. The Company records unbilled receivables, which are included in Prepaids and other current assets, when it has completed a performance obligation prior to its ability to bill under the customer arrangement. Other contract assets are included in Notes receivable and other non-current assets. The Company recorded an immaterial change in unbilled receivables attributable to non-lease property revenue recognized during each of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. The change in contract assets attributable to revenue recognized during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $ 2.2 million and $ 6.8 million, respectively. The Company does not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for agreements (i) with an original expected length of one year or less or (ii) for which it recognizes revenue at the amount to which it has the right to invoice for services performed. Lease Accounting and Rent Expense —The Company accounts for leases using a right-of-use model, which recognizes that, at the date of commencement, a lessee has a financial obligation to make lease payments to the lessor for the right to use the underlying asset during the lease term. The lessee recognizes a corresponding right-of-use asset related to this right. The Company recognizes a right-of-use lease asset and lease liability for operating and finance leases. The right-of-use asset is measured as the sum of the lease liability, prepaid or accrued lease payments, any initial direct costs incurred and any other applicable amounts. The Company reviews its right-of-use assets for impairment whenever events, changes in circumstances or other evidence indicate that the carrying amount of the Company’s assets may not be recoverable. The Company reviews its right-of-use assets for indicators of impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, as part of its asset portfolio. Impairments primarily result from a site not having current tenant leases or from having expenses in excess of revenues. The Company records impairment charges, which are discussed in note 17, in Other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the Company identifies such impairment. F-15 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) The calculation of the lease liability requires the Company to make certain assumptions for each lease, including lease term and discount rate implicit in each lease, which could significantly impact the gross lease obligation, the duration and the present value of the lease liability. When calculating the lease term, the Company considers the renewal, cancellation and termination rights available to the Company and the lessor. The Company determines the discount rate by calculating the incremental borrowing rate on a collateralized basis at the commencement of a lease or upon a change in the lease term. Many of the leases underlying the Company’s sites have fixed rent escalations, which provide for periodic increases in the amount of ground rent payable by the Company over time. In addition, certain of the Company’s tenant leases require the Company to exercise available renewal options pursuant to the underlying ground lease if the tenant exercises its renewal option. The Company’s calculation of the lease liability includes the term of the underlying ground lease plus all periods, if any, for which failure to renew the lease imposes an economic penalty to the Company such that renewal appears to be reasonably assured. The straight-line component of ground rent expense for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $ 52.7 million, $ 51.6 million and $ 44.4 million, respectively. Selling, General, Administrative and Development Expense —Selling, general and administrative expense consists of overhead expenses related to the Company’s property and services operations and corporate overhead costs not specifically allocable to any of the Company’s individual business operations. Development expense consists of costs related to the Company’s acquisition efforts, costs associated with new business initiatives and project cancellation costs. Stock-Based Compensation —Stock-based compensation expense is measured at the accounting measurement date based on the fair value of the award and is generally recognized as an expense over the service period, which typically represents the vesting period. The Company provides for accelerated vesting and extended exercise periods of stock options and restricted stock units upon an employee’s death or permanent disability, or upon an employee’s qualified retirement, provided certain eligibility criteria are met. Accordingly, the Company recognizes compensation expense for stock options and time-based restricted stock units (“RSUs”) over the shorter of (i) the four-year vesting period or (ii) the period from the date of grant to the date the employee becomes eligible for such benefits due to death, disability or qualified retirement, which may occur upon grant. The expense recognized includes the impact of forfeitures as they occur. The Company grants performance-based restricted stock units (“PSUs”) to its executive officers. Threshold, target and maximum parameters are established for a three-year performance period at the time of grant. The metrics are used to calculate the number of shares that will be issuable when the awards vest, which may range from zero to 200 % of the target amounts. The Company recognizes compensation expense for PSUs over the three-year vesting period, subject to adjustment based on the date the employee becomes eligible for retirement benefits as well as performance relative to grant parameters. The fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and the fair value of RSUs and PSUs is based on the fair value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. The Company recognizes all stock-based compensation expense in either Selling, general, administrative and development expense, costs of operations or as part of the costs associated with the construction of assets. In connection with the vesting of restricted stock units, the Company withholds from issuance a number of shares of common stock to satisfy certain employee tax withholding obligations arising from such vesting. The shares withheld are considered constructively retired. The Company recognizes the fair value of the shares withheld in Additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has withheld from issuance an aggregate of 2.6 million shares, including 0.2 million shares related to the vesting of restricted stock units during the year ended December 31, 2021. Litigation Costs —The Company periodically becomes involved in various claims and lawsuits that are incidental to its business. The Company regularly monitors the status of pending legal actions to evaluate both the magnitude and likelihood of any potential loss. The Company accrues for these potential losses when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss, or possible range of loss, can be reasonably estimated. Should the ultimate losses on contingencies or litigation vary from estimates, adjustments to those liabilities may be required. The Company also incurs legal costs in connection with these matters and records estimates of these expenses, which are reflected in Selling, general, administrative and development expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Earnings Per Common Share — Basic and Diluted —Basic net income per common share represents net income attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per common share represents net income attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period and any dilutive common share equivalents, including (A) shares issuable upon the vesting of RSUs and exercise of stock options and F-16 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) (B) shares expected to be earned upon the achievement of the parameters established for PSUs, each to the extent not anti-dilutive. The Company uses the treasury stock method to calculate the effect of its outstanding RSUs, PSUs and stock options. Retirement Plan —The Company has a 401(k) plan covering nearly all eligible employees who meet certain age and employment requirements. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company matched 100 % of the first 5 % of a participant's contributions. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company contributed $ 14.9 million, $ 13.2 million and $ 11.8 million to the plan, respectively. Accounting Standards Updates In March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued guidance to provide optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The guidance applies only to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. The expedients and exceptions provided by the guidance do not apply to contract modifications made and hedging relationships entered into or evaluated after December 31, 2022, except for hedging relationships existing as of December 31, 2022 for which an entity has elected certain optional expedients that are retained through the end of the hedging relationship. In January 2021, the FASB issued additional guidance that clarifies that certain practical expedients and exceptions for contract modifications and hedge accounting apply to derivatives that are affected by reference rate reform. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has not modified any contracts as a result of reference rate reform and is evaluating the impact this standard may have on its consolidated financial statements. 2. PREPAID AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS Prepaid and other current assets consisted of the following: As of December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Prepaid assets $ 94.5 $ 66.1 Prepaid income tax 128.6 143.7 Unbilled receivables 269.6 176.9 Value added tax and other consumption tax receivables 83.9 66.3 Other miscellaneous current assets 80.6 79.6 Prepaid and other current assets $ 657.2 $ 532.6 3.

LEASES The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at the inception of the agreement. The Company considers an arrangement to be a lease if it conveys the right to control the use of the communications infrastructure or ground space underneath a communications infrastructure for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The Company is both a lessor and a lessee. Lessor —The Company is a lessor in most of its revenue arrangements, as property revenue is derived from tenant leases of specifically-identified, physically distinct space on or in the Company’s communications real estate assets. The Company’s lease arrangements with its tenants for its communications sites vary depending upon the region and the industry of the tenant and generally have initial non-cancellable terms of five to ten years with multiple renewal terms. The leases also contain provisions that periodically increase the rent due, typically annually, based on a fixed escalation percentage or an inflationary index, or a combination of both. The Company structures its leases to include financial penalties if a tenant terminates the lease, which serve to disincentivize tenants from terminating the lease prior to the expiration of the lease term. The Company’s leasing arrangements outside of the United States may require that the Company provide power to the communications site through an electrical grid connection, diesel fuel generators or other sources and permit the Company to pass through the costs of, or otherwise charge for, these services. Many arrangements require that the communications site has power for a specified percentage of time. In most cases, if delivery of power falls below the specified service level, a corresponding reduction in revenue is recorded. The Company has determined that this performance obligation is satisfied over time for the duration of the lease. In addition, the Company provides power to its data center customers, which is passed through, or otherwise charged, to customers pursuant to the terms of the customer power arrangement. Customer power arrangements are coterminous with such customer’s underlying lease and have the same pattern of transfer over the lease term. This performance obligation is generally satisfied over time for the duration of the lease. Fixed power revenue is recognized each month over the term of the lease. For variable power arrangements, the Company recognizes revenue each month as the uncertainty related to the consideration is resolved. The Company typically has more than one tenant on a site and, by performing ordinary course repair and maintenance work, can often lease a site, either through renewing existing agreements or leasing to new tenants, for periods beyond the existing tenant lease term. Accordingly, the Company has minimal risk with respect to the residual value of its leased assets. Communications infrastructure assets are depreciated over their estimated useful lives, which generally do not exceed twenty years . F-18 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) As of December 31, 2021, the Company does not have any material related party leases as a lessor. To the extent there are any intercompany leases, these are eliminated in consolidation. The Company generally does not enter into sales-type leases or direct financing leases. The Company’s leases generally do not include any incentives for the lessee, however, if incentives are present, they are evaluated to determine proper treatment and, to the extent present, are recorded in Other current assets and Other non-current assets in the consolidated balance sheets. In addition, the Company’s leases do not include any lessee purchase options. Historically, the Company has been able to successfully renew its ground leases as needed to ensure continuation of its revenue. Accordingly, the Company assumes that it will have access to the land underneath its sites when calculating future minimum rental receipts. Future minimum rental receipts expected under non-cancellable operating lease agreements as of December 31, 2021, were as follows: Fiscal Year Amount (1) 2022 $ 6,477.8 2023 6,958.9 2024 6,746.9 2025 6,247.6 2026 5,664.8 Thereafter 29,330.2 Total $ 61,426.2 _______________ (1) Balances are translated at the applicable period-end exchange rate, which may impact comparability between periods. Lessee —The Company enters into arrangements as a lessee primarily for ground space underneath its communications sites. These arrangements are typically long-term lease agreements with initial non-cancellable terms of approximately five to ten years with one or more automatic or exercisable renewal periods and specified increases in lease payments upon exercise of the renewal options. The Company typically exercises its ground lease renewal options in order to provide ongoing tenant space on or in its communications sites through the end of the tenant lease term. Escalation clauses present in operating leases, excluding those tied to CPI or other inflation-based indices, are recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated lease term of the applicable lease as a component of rent expense. Additionally, the escalations tied to CPI or another inflation-based index are considered variable lease payments. In certain circumstances, the Company enters into revenue sharing arrangements with the ground space owner, which results in variability in lease payments. In most markets outside of the United States, in the event there are no tenants on the communications site, the Company generally has unilateral termination rights and in certain situations, the lease is structured to allow for termination by the Company with minimal or no penalties. Ground lease arrangements usually include annual escalations and do not contain any residual value guarantees or restrictions on dividends, other financial obligations or other similar terms. The Company has entered into certain transactions whereby at the end of a lease, sublease or similar arrangement, the Company has the option to purchase the corresponding communications sites. These transactions are further described in note 19. The Company’s lease liability is the present value of the remaining minimum rental payments to be made over the remaining lease term, including renewal options reasonably certain to be exercised. The Company also considers termination options and factors those into the determination of lease payments when appropriate. To determine the lease term, the Company considers all renewal periods that are reasonably certain to be exercised, taking into consideration all economic factors, including the communications site’s estimated economic life (generally twenty years ) and the respective lease terms of the Company’s tenants under the existing lease arrangements on such site. The Company assesses its right-of-use asset and other lease-related assets for impairment, as described in note 1. During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded $ 3.3 million, $ 76.1 million and $ 9.9 million, respectively, of impairment expense related to these assets. As of December 31, 2021, the Company does not have any material related party leases as a lessee. The Company does not have any sale-leaseback arrangements as lessee and typically does not enter into leveraged leases. The Company leases certain land, buildings, equipment and office space under operating leases and land and improvements, towers, equipment and vehicles under finance leases. As of December 31, 2021, operating lease assets were included in Right-of-use asset and finance lease assets were included in Property and equipment, net in the consolidated balance sheet. F-19 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) Information about other lease-related balances is as follows: As of December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Operating leases: Right-of-use asset $ 9,225.1 $ 7,789.2 Current portion of lease liability $ 712.6 $ 539.9 Lease liability 8,041.8 6,884.4 Total operating lease liability $ 8,754.4 $ 7,424.3 Finance leases: Current portion of lease liability $ 6.7 $ 4.9 Lease liability 24.9 23.0 Total finance lease liability $ 31.6 $ 27.9 As most of the Company’s leases do not specifically state an implicit rate, the Company uses a market-specific incremental borrowing rate consistent with the lease term as of the lease commencement date or upon a remeasurement event when calculating the present value of the remaining lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate reflects the cost to borrow on a securitized basis in each market. The remaining lease term does not reflect all renewal options available to the Company, only those renewal options that the Company has assessed as reasonably certain of being exercised taking into consideration the economic and other factors noted above. The weighted-average remaining lease terms and incremental borrowing rates are as follows: As of December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Operating leases: Weighted-average remaining lease term (years) 13.0 13.7 Weighted-average incremental borrowing rate 5.1 % 5.6 % Finance leases: Weighted-average remaining lease term (years) 13.4 12.1 Weighted-average incremental borrowing rate 6.3 % 6.8 % The following table sets forth the components of lease cost for the years ended December 31,: 2021 2020 2019 Operating lease cost $ 1,115.1 $ 977.2 $ 1,013.1 Variable lease costs not included in lease liability (1) 339.6 280.0 261.7 _______________ (1) Includes property tax paid on behalf of the landlord.

Africa consists of measurement period adjustments related to the acquisition of Eaton Towers Holdings Limited (the “Eaton Towers Acquisition”). (2) U.S. & Canada consists of measurement period adjustments related to the InSite Acquisition. Asia-Pacific consists of $ 9.2 million of additions related to the Bangladesh Acquisition (as discussed in note 6) and measurement period adjustments related to the InSite Acquisition. Europe and Latin America consist of additions and measurement period adjustments related to the Telxius Acquisition (as defined in note 6). Data Centers consists of $ 3.0 billion of additions related to data center acquisitions, primarily from the CoreSite Acquisition. F-21 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) The Company’s other intangible assets subject to amortization consisted of the following: As of December 31, 2021 As of December 31, 2020 Estimated Useful Lives (years) Gross Carrying Value Accumulated Amortization Net Book Value Gross Carrying Value Accumulated Amortization Net Book Value Acquired network location intangibles (1) Up to 20 $ 6,294.6 $ ( 2,305.1 ) $ 3,989.5 $ 5,784.0 $ ( 2,117.6 ) $ 3,666.4 Acquired tenant-related intangibles Up to 20 20,030.5 ( 5,051.5 ) 14,979.0 14,322.5 ( 4,237.5 ) 10,085.0 Acquired licenses and other intangibles (2) 2 - 20 1,807.9 ( 49.2 ) 1,758.7 97.8 ( 9.4 ) 88.4 Total other intangible assets $ 28,133.0 $ ( 7,405.8 ) $ 20,727.2 $ 20,204.3 $ ( 6,364.5 ) $ 13,839.8 _______________ (1) Acquired network location intangibles are amortized over the shorter of the term of the corresponding ground lease, taking into consideration lease renewal options and residual value, generally up to 20 years, as the Company considers these intangibles to be directly related to the tower assets. (2) In connection with the CoreSite Acquisition, the Company acquired $ 1.7 billion of other intangible assets. The acquired other intangible assets will amortize over periods ranging from approximately two years to 10 years. The acquired network location intangibles represent the value to the Company of the incremental revenue growth that could potentially be obtained from leasing the excess capacity on acquired tower communications infrastructure. The acquired tenant-related intangibles typically represent the value to the Company of tenant contracts and relationships in place at the time of an acquisition or similar transaction, including assumptions regarding estimated renewals. Other intangibles represent the value of acquired licenses, trade name and in place leases. In place lease value represents the fair value of costs avoided in securing data center customers, including vacancy periods, legal costs and commissions. In addition, this value also includes assumptions on similar costs avoided upon the renewal or extension of existing leases on a basis consistent with occupancy assumptions used in the fair value of other assets. The Company amortizes its acquired network location intangibles and tenant-related intangibles on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. As of December 31, 2021, the remaining weighted average amortization period of the Company’s intangible assets wa s 15 years . Amortization of intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $ 1.2 billion, $ 867.2 million and $ 791.3 million, respectively. Based on current exchange rates, the Company expects to record amortization expense as follows over the next five years: Fiscal Year Amount 2022 $ 1,802.4 2023 1,366.9 2024 1,352.8 2025 1,271.8 2026 1,237.5 6. ACQUISITIONS The Company evaluates each of its acquisitions under the accounting guidance framework to determine whether to treat an acquisition as an asset acquisition or a business combination. For those transactions treated as asset acquisitions, the purchase price is allocated to the assets or rights acquired and liabilities assumed, with no recognition of goodwill. For those transactions treated as business combinations, the estimates of the fair value of the assets or rights acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of the applicable acquisition are subject to adjustment during the measurement period (up to one year from the particular acquisition date). The primary areas of the accounting for the acquisitions that are not yet finalized relate to the fair value of certain tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including tax positions, which may include contingent consideration, residual goodwill and any related tax impact. The fair value of these net assets acquired are based on management’s estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. While the Company believes that such preliminary estimates provide a reasonable basis for estimating the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, it evaluates any necessary information prior to finalization of the fair value. During the measurement period for those F-22 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) acquisitions accounted for as business combinations, the Company will adjust assets or liabilities if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have resulted in the revised estimated values of those assets or liabilities as of that date. Impact of current year acquisitions —The Company typically acquires communications sites and other communications infrastructure assets from wireless carriers or other tower operators and subsequently integrates those sites and related assets into its existing portfolio of communications sites and related assets. In the United States, the Company has also acquired data center facilities and related assets, including the CoreSite Acquisition, as discussed below. The financial results of the Company’s acquisitions have been included in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 from the date of the respective acquisition. The date of acquisition, and by extension the point at which the Company begins to recognize the results of an acquisition, may depend on, among other things, the receipt of contractual consents, the commencement and extent of leasing arrangements and the timing of the transfer of title or rights to the assets, which may be accomplished in phases. Sites acquired from communications service providers may never have been operated as a business and may instead have been utilized solely by the seller as a component of its network infrastructure. An acquisition may or may not involve the transfer of business operations or employees. For those acquisitions accounted for as business combinations, the Company recognizes acquisition and merger related expenses in the period in which they are incurred and services are received; for transactions accounted for as asset acquisitions, these costs are capitalized as part of the purchase price. Acquisition and merger related costs may include finder’s fees, advisory, legal, accounting, valuation and other professional or consulting fees and general administrative costs directly related to completing the transaction. Integration costs include incremental and non-recurring costs necessary to convert data and systems, retain employees and otherwise enable the Company to operate acquired businesses or assets efficiently. The Company records acquisition and merger related expenses for business combinations, as well as integration costs for all acquisitions, in Other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded acquisition and merger related expenses for business combinations and non-capitalized asset acquisition costs and integration costs as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 Acquisition and merger related expenses $ 177.0 $ 15.5 $ 26.9 Integration costs $ 50.4 $ 23.1 $ 9.8 During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded net benefits of $ 17.6 million, $ 4.4 million and $ 13.1 million related to pre-acquisition contingencies and settlements, respectively. The increase in acquisition and merger related costs during the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily associated with the Telxius Acquisition and the CoreSite Acquisition. 2021 Transactions The estimated aggregate impact of the acquisitions completed in 2021 on the Company’s revenues and gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2021 was approximately $ 424.3 million and $ 214.8 million, respectively. The revenues and gross margin amounts also reflect incremental revenues from the addition of new customers to such communications infrastructure assets subsequent to the transaction date. Acquisitions completed in 2021 were included in all of the Company’s property segments. Data Centers U.S. Data Centers Acquisition— On October 5, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of two multi-customer data center facilities in the United States markets for total consideration of approximately $ 200.6 million. The acquired assets and operations are included in the Data Centers segment. This acquisition is being accounted for as a business combination and is subject to post-closing adjustments. This acquisition is included in the table below in “Other.” CoreSite Acquisition —On November 14, 2021, the Company entered into an agreement with CoreSite to acquire all issued and outstanding shares of CoreSite common stock at $ 170.00 per share. CoreSite’s portfolio consisted of 24 data center facilities and related assets in eight United States markets. On December 28, 2021, the Company completed the CoreSite Acquisition for total consideration of approximately $ 10.4 billion, including the assumption and repayment of CoreSite’s existing debt. The acquired assets and operations are included in the Data Centers segment. The CoreSite Acquisition was accounted for as a business combination and is subject to post-closing adjustments. F-23 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) Communications Sites Telxius Acquisition —On January 13, 2021, the Company entered into two agreements with Telxius Telecom, S.A. (“Telxius”), a subsidiary of Telefónica, S.A., pursuant to which the Company agreed to acquire Telxius’ European and Latin American tower divisions, comprising approximately 31,000 communications sites in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Germany, Peru and Spain, for approximately 7.7 billion Euros (“EUR”) (approximately $ 9.4 billion at the date of signing) (the “Telxius Acquisition”), subject to certain adjustments. In June 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of nearly 20,000 communications sites in Germany and Spain, for total consideration of approximately 6.3 billion EUR (approximately $ 7.7 billion at the date of closing), subject to certain post-closing adjustments and over 7,000 communications sites in Brazil, Peru, Chile and Argentina, for total consideration of approximately 0.9 billion EUR (approximately $ 1.1 billion at the date of closing), subject to certain post-closing adjustments. On August 2, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of the approximately 4,000 remaining communications sites in Germany pursuant to the Telxius Acquisition for 0.6 billion EUR (approximately $ 0.7 billion at the date of closing), subject to certain post-closing adjustments. Of the aggregate purchase price, 233.2 million EUR (approximately $ 265.2 million), including post-closing adjustments, of deferred payments are due in September 2025 and are reflected in Other non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021. The acquired operations in Germany and Spain are included in the Europe property segment and the acquired operations in Brazil, Peru, Chile and Argentina are included in the Latin America property segment. The Telxius Acquisition was accounted for as a business combination and is subject to post-closing adjustments. Subsequent to the acquisition dates, certain adjustments were made to increase assets by $ 6.0 million and reduce liabilities by $ 58.7 million, with a corresponding decrease in goodwill of $ 64.7 million. There were no other material post-closing adjustments. The full reconciliation and finalization of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including those subject to valuation, have not been completed and, as a result, there may be additional post-closing adjustments. Entel Acquisition —On December 19, 2019, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire approximately 3,200 communications sites in Chile and Peru from Entel PCS Telecomunicaciones S.A. and Entel Peru S.A. (“Entel”) for total consideration of approximately $ 0.8 billion (as of the date of signing). The Company completed the acquisition of approximately 2,400 communications sites in December 2019 and an additional 530 communications sites pursuant to this agreement during the year ended December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of the remaining 156 communications sites pursuant to this agreement for an aggregate total purchase price of $ 44.5 million (as of the dates of acquisition), including value added tax, which have been accounted for as an acquisition of assets and are included in the table below in “Other.” Bangladesh Acquisition —During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company acquired a 51 % controlling interest in Kirtonkhola Tower Bangladesh Limited (“KTBL”) for 900 million Bangladeshi Taka (“BDT”) (approximately $ 10.6 million at the date of closing). Confidence Group holds a 49 % noncontrolling interest in KTBL. This acquisition is being accounted for as a business combination and is subject to post-closing adjustments. This acquisition is included in the table below in “Other.” Other Acquisitions— During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company acquired a total of 1,309 communications sites as well as other communications infrastructure assets, in the United States, France, Mexico, Nigeria, Peru and Poland, including 633 communications sites in connection with the Company’s agreements with Orange S.A. (“Orange”) as further described below, for an aggregate purchase price of $ 565.6 million. Of the aggregate purchase price, $ 89.8 million is reflected as a payable in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021. These acquisitions were primarily accounted for as asset acquisitions and are included in the table below in “Other.” F-24 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) The following table summarizes the allocations of the purchase prices for the fiscal year 2021 acquisitions based upon their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition: CoreSite Acquisition Telxius Acquisition Other (1) Current assets $ 99.8 $ 284.9 $ 56.4 Property and equipment 5,129.0 1,414.6 391.3 Intangible assets (2): Tenant-related intangible assets 665.0 5,371.3 308.3 Network location intangible assets — 672.0 88.0 Other intangible assets 1,709.0 — 1.7 Other non-current assets 332.9 1,398.4 52.5 Current liabilities ( 156.6 ) ( 338.9 ) ( 15.7 ) Deferred tax liability — ( 1,195.4 ) — Other non-current liabilities ( 323.1 ) ( 1,534.2 ) ( 61.0 ) Net assets acquired 7,456.0 6,072.7 821.5 Goodwill (3) 2,943.3 3,517.0 10.0 Fair value of net assets acquired 10,399.3 9,589.7 831.5 Debt assumed (4) ( 955.1 ) — — Noncontrolling interest — — ( 10.2 ) Purchase price (5) $ 9,444.2 $ 9,589.7 $ 821.3 ______________ (1) Includes 21 sites in Peru held pursuant to long-term finance leases.

The notes rank equally with all of the Company’s other senior unsecured debt and are structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of its subsidiaries. Each applicable supplemental indenture for the notes contains certain covenants that restrict the Company’s ability to merge, consolidate or sell assets and its (together with its subsidiaries’) ability to incur liens. These covenants are subject to a number of exceptions, including that the Company and its subsidiaries may incur certain liens on assets, mortgages or other liens securing indebtedness if the aggregate amount of indebtedness secured by such liens does not exceed 3.5 x Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the applicable supplemental indenture.

Cash flows generated by the sites that secure the securitized debt of the Company are only available for payment of such debt and are not available to pay the Company’s other obligations or the claims of its creditors. However, subject to certain restrictions, the Company holds the right to receive the excess cash flows not needed to service the securitized debt and other obligations arising out of the securitizations. The securitized debt is the obligation of the issuers thereof or borrowers thereunder, as applicable, and their subsidiaries, and not of the Company or its other subsidiaries. American Tower Secured Revenue Notes, Series 2015-1, Class A and Series 2015-2, Class A —In May 2015, GTP Acquisition Partners I, LLC (“GTP Acquisition Partners”), one of the Company’s wholly owned subsidiaries, refinanced existing debt with cash on hand and proceeds from a private issuance (the “2015 Securitization”) of $ 350.0 million of American Tower Secured Revenue Notes, Series 2015-1, Class A (the “Series 2015-1 Notes”) and $ 525.0 million of American Tower Secured Revenue Notes, Series 2015-2, Class A (the “Series 2015-2 Notes,” and together with the Series 2015-1 Notes, the “2015 Notes”). The 2015 Notes were issued by GTP Acquisition Partners pursuant to a Third Amended and Restated Indenture and related series supplements, each dated as of May 29, 2015 (collectively, the “2015 Indenture”), between GTP Acquisition Partners and its subsidiaries (the “GTP Entities”) and The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee. The effective weighted average life and interest rate of the 2015 Notes was 8.1 years and 3.029 %, respectively, as of the date of issuance. Repayment of Series 2015-1 Notes —On the June 2020 payment date, the Company repaid the entire $ 350.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Series 2015-1 Notes, pursuant to the terms of the agreements governing such securities. The repayment was funded with cash on hand. The outstanding Series 2015-2 Notes are secured by (i) mortgages, deeds of trust and deeds to secure debt on substantially all of the 3,531 communications sites (the “2015 Secured Sites”) owned by the GTP Entities and their operating cash flows, (ii) a security interest in substantially all of the personal property and fixtures of the GTP Entities, including GTP Acquisition Partners’ equity interests in its subsidiaries and (iii) the rights of the GTP Entities under a management agreement. American Tower Holding Sub II, LLC, whose only material assets are its equity interests in GTP Acquisition Partners, has guaranteed F-34 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) repayment of the Series 2015-2 Notes and pledged its equity interests in GTP Acquisition Partners as security for such payment obligations. Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2013-2A , Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2018-1, Subclass A and Series 2018-1, Subclass R —On March 29, 2018, the Company completed a securitization transaction (the “2018 Securitization”), in which the American Tower Trust I (the “Trust”) issued $ 500.0 million aggregate principal amount of Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2018-1, Subclass A (the “Series 2018-1A Securities”). To satisfy the applicable risk retention requirements of Regulation RR promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act” and, such requirements, the “Risk Retention Rules”), the Trust issued, and one of the Company’s affiliates purchased, $ 26.4 million aggregate principal amount of Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2018-1, Subclass R (the “Series 2018-1R Securities” and, together with the Series 2018-1A Securities, the “2018 Securities”) to retain an “eligible horizontal residual interest” (as defined in the Risk Retention Rules) in an amount equal to at least 5% of the fair value of the 2018 Securities. The Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2013-2A (the “Series 2013-2A Securities” and, together with the 2018 Securities the “Trust Securities”) issued in a securitization transaction in March 2013 (the “2013 Securitization” and, together with the 2018 Securitization, the “Trust Securitizations”) remain outstanding and are subject to the terms of the Second Amended and Restated Trust and Servicing Agreement entered into in connection with the 2018 Securitization. The assets of the Trust consist of a nonrecourse loan (the “Loan”) made by the Trust to American Tower Asset Sub, LLC and American Tower Asset Sub II, LLC (together, the “AMT Asset Subs”). The AMT Asset Subs are jointly and severally liable under the Loan, which is secured primarily by mortgages on the AMT Asset Subs’ interests in 5,113 broadcast and wireless communications towers and related assets (the “Trust Sites”). The component of the Loan corresponding to the Series 2013-2A Securities also remains outstanding and is subject to the terms of the Second Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement among the Trust and the AMT Asset Subs, dated as of March 29, 2018 (the “Loan Agreement”). The Loan Agreement includes terms and conditions, including with respect to secured assets, substantially consistent with the First Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement dated as of March 15, 2013. The 2018 Securities correspond to components of the Loan made to the AMT Asset Subs pursuant to the Loan Agreement and were issued in two separate subclasses of the same series. The 2018 Securities represent a pass-through interest in the components of the Loan corresponding to the 2018 Securities. The Series 2018-1A Securities have an interest rate of 3.652 % and the Series 2018-1R Securities have an interest rate of 4.459 %. The 2018 Securities have an expected life of approximately ten years with a final repayment date in March 2048. Subject to certain limited exceptions described below, no payments of principal will be required to be made on the components of the Loan corresponding to the 2018 Securities prior to the monthly payment date in March 2028, which is the anticipated repayment date for such components. The Loan is secured by (1) mortgages, deeds of trust and deeds to secure debt on substantially all of the Trust Sites and their operating cash flows, (2) a security interest in substantially all of the AMT Asset Subs’ personal property and fixtures and (3) the AMT Asset Subs’ rights under that certain management agreement among the AMT Asset Subs and SpectraSite Communications, LLC entered into in March 2013. American Tower Holding Sub, LLC (the “Guarantor”), whose only material assets are its equity interests in each of the AMT Asset Subs, and American Tower Guarantor Sub, LLC whose only material asset is its equity interests in the Guarantor, have each guaranteed repayment of the Loan and pledged their equity interests in their respective subsidiary or subsidiaries as security for such payment obligations. Under the terms of the Loan Agreement and the 2015 Indenture, amounts due will be paid from the cash flows generated by the Trust Sites or the 2015 Secured Sites, respectively, which must be deposited into certain reserve accounts, and thereafter distributed, solely pursuant to the terms of the Loan Agreement or 2015 Indenture, as applicable. On a monthly basis, after payment of all required amounts under the Loan Agreement or 2015 Indenture, as applicable, including interest payments, subject to the conditions described below, the excess cash flows generated from the operation of such assets are released to the AMT Asset Subs or GTP Acquisition Partners, as applicable, which can then be distributed to, and used by, the Company. In order to distribute any excess cash flow to the Company, the AMT Asset Subs and GTP Acquisition Partners must each maintain a specified debt service coverage ratio (the “DSCR”), which is generally calculated as the ratio of the net cash flow (as defined in the applicable agreement) to the amount of interest, servicing fees and trustee fees required to be paid over the succeeding 12 months on the principal amount of the Loan or the 2015 Notes, as applicable, that will be outstanding on the payment date following such date of determination. If the DSCR were equal to or below 1.30 x (the “Cash Trap DSCR”) for any quarter, then all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments, fund required reserves, pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and make other payments required under the applicable transaction documents, referred to as excess cash flow, will be deposited into a reserve account (the “Cash Trap Reserve Account”) instead of being released to the AMT Asset Subs or GTP Acquisition Partners, as applicable. The funds in the Cash Trap Reserve F-35 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) Account will not be released to the AMT Asset Subs or GTP Acquisition Partners, as applicable, unless the DSCR exceeds the Cash Trap DSCR for two consecutive calendar quarters. Additionally, an “amortization period” commences if, as of the end of any calendar quarter, the DSCR is equal to or below 1.15 x (the “Minimum DSCR”) and will continue to exist until the DSCR exceeds the Minimum DSCR for two consecutive calendar quarters. With respect to the Trust Securities, an “amortization period” also commences if, on the anticipated repayment date the component of the Loan corresponding to the applicable subclass of the Trust Securities has not been repaid in full, provided that such amortization period shall apply with respect to such component that has not been repaid in full. If the Series 2015-2 Notes have not been repaid in full on the applicable anticipated repayment date, additional interest will accrue on the unpaid principal balance of the Series 2015-2 Notes, and such notes will begin to amortize on a monthly basis from excess cash flow. During an amortization period, all excess cash flow and any amounts then in the applicable Cash Trap Reserve Account would be applied to pay the principal of the Loan or the Series 2015-2 Notes, as applicable, on each monthly payment date. The Loan and the Series 2015-2 Notes may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time, provided such payment is accompanied by the applicable prepayment consideration. If the prepayment occurs within 18 months of the anticipated repayment date with respect to the Series 2013-2A Securities or the Series 2015-2 Notes, or 36 months of the anticipated repayment date with respect to the Series 2018 Securities, no prepayment consideration is due. The Loan Agreement and the 2015 Indenture include operating covenants and other restrictions customary for transactions subject to rated securitizations. Among other things, the AMT Asset Subs and the GTP Entities, as applicable, are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets subject to customary carve-outs for ordinary course trade payables and permitted encumbrances (as defined in the Loan Agreement or the 2015 Indenture, as applicable). The organizational documents of the AMT Asset Subs and the GTP Entities contain provisions consistent with rating agency securitization criteria for special purpose entities, including the requirement that they maintain independent directors. The Loan Agreement and the 2015 Indenture also contain certain covenants that require the AMT Asset Subs or GTP Acquisition Partners, as applicable, to provide the respective trustee with regular financial reports and operating budgets, promptly notify such trustee of events of default and material breaches under the Loan Agreement and other agreements related to the Trust Sites or the 2015 Indenture and other agreements related to the 2015 Secured Sites, as applicable, and allow the applicable trustee reasonable access to the sites, including the right to conduct site investigations. A failure to comply with the covenants in the Loan Agreement or the 2015 Indenture could prevent the AMT Asset Subs or GTP Acquisition Partners, as applicable, from distributing excess cash flow to the Company. Furthermore, if the AMT Asset Subs or GTP Acquisition Partners were to default on the Loan or the Series 2015-2 Notes, the applicable trustee may seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of all or any portion of the Trust Sites or the 2015 Secured Sites, respectively, in which case the Company could lose the revenue associated with those assets. With respect to the Series 2015-2 Notes, upon the occurrence of, and during, an event of default, the applicable trustee may, in its discretion or at the direction of holders of more than 50 % of the aggregate outstanding principal of the Series 2015-2 Notes, declare such notes immediately due and payable, in which case any excess cash flow would need to be used to pay holders of such notes. Further, under the Loan Agreement and the 2015 Indenture, the AMT Asset Subs or GTP Acquisition Partners, respectively, are required to maintain reserve accounts, including for ground rents, real estate and personal property taxes and insurance premiums, and, under the 2015 Indenture and in certain circumstances under the Loan Agreement, to reserve a portion of advance rents from tenants on the Trust Sites. Based on the terms of the Loan Agreement and the 2015 Indenture, all rental cash receipts received for each month are reserved for the succeeding month and held in an account controlled by the applicable trustee and then released. The $ 251.8 million held in the reserve accounts with respect to the Trust Securitizations and the $ 107.0 million held in the reserve accounts with respect to the 2015 Securitization as of December 31, 2021 are classified as Restricted cash on the Company’s accompanying consolidated balance sheets. India Indebtedness — The India indebtedness includes several working capital facilities, most of which are subject to annual renewal, and an overdraft facility. The working capital facilities bear interest at rates that consist of the applicable bank’s Marginal Cost of Funds based Lending Rate (as defined in the applicable agreement), plus a spread. Generally, the working capital facilities are payable on demand prior to maturity. The overdraft facility bears interest at the Overnight Mumbai Inter-Bank Offer Rate at the time of borrowing plus a spread.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS The Company determines the fair value of its financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Below are the three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date. Level 2 Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Items Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis — The fair values of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities that are required to be measured on a recurring basis at fair value were as follows: December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Fair Value Measurements Using Fair Value Measurements Using Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Assets: Interest rate swap agreements — $ 11.0 — — $ 29.2 — Investments in equity securities (1) $ 37.1 — — — $ 6.0 — Liabilities: Interest rate swap agreements — — — — $ 0.1 — Fair value of debt related to interest rate swap agreements (2) $ 12.2 — — $ 31.4 — — _______________ (1) Investments in equity securities are recorded in Notes receivable and other non-current assets in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value. Unrealized holding gains and losses for equity securities are recorded in Other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations in the current period. During the year ended December 31, 2021 , the Company recognized unrealized gains of $ 6.1 million for equity securities held as of December 31, 2021. (2) Included in the carrying values of the corresponding debt obligations. Interest Rate Swap Agreements The fair value of the Company’s interest rate swap agreements is determined using pricing models with inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, changes in the value of the derivatives are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in the current period, along with the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the Company records the change in fair value for the effective portion of the cash flow hedges in AOCL in the consolidated balance sheets and reclassifies a portion of the value from AOCL into Interest expense on a quarterly basis as the cash flows from the hedged item affects earnings. The Company records the settlement of interest rate swap agreements in (Loss) gain on retirement of long-term obligations in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the settlement occurs. The Company entered into three interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional value of $ 500.0 million related to the 3.000 % senior unsecured notes due 2023 (the “ 3.000 % Notes”). These interest rate swaps, which were designated as fair value hedges at inception, were entered into to hedge against changes in fair value of the 3.000 % Notes resulting from changes in interest rates. The interest rate swap agreements require the Company to pay interest at a variable interest rate of one-month LIBOR plus applicable spreads and to receive fixed interest at a rate of 3.000 % through June 15, 2023. The Company entered into three interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional value of $ 600.0 million related to the 2.250 % Notes. These interest rate swaps, which were designated as fair value hedges at inception, were entered into to hedge against changes in fair value of the 2.250 % Notes resulting from changes in interest rates. The interest rate swap agreements required the Company to pay interest at a variable interest rate of one-month LIBOR plus applicable spreads and to receive fixed interest at a rate of 2.250 % through January 15, 2022. The interest rate swap agreements expired upon repayment of the 2.250 % Notes in full on January 14, 2022 upon maturity. F-39 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) The fair value of the interest rate swap agreements in the United States at December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $ 11.0 million and $ 29.2 million, respectively, and was included in Other non-current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded net fair value adjustments of $ 0.9 million related to interest rate swaps and the change in fair value of debt due to interest rate swaps in Other expense in the consolidated statements of operations. One of the Company’s Colombian subsidiaries was party to an interest rate swap agreement with certain lenders under the Colombian Credit Facility (the “Colombia Interest Rate Swap”). The Colombia Interest Rate Swap, which was designated as a cash flow hedge at inception, was entered into to manage exposure to variability in interest rates on debt. The Colombia Interest Rate Swap required the payment of a fixed interest rate of 5.37 % and paid variable interest at the three-month Inter-bank Rate through the earlier of termination of the underlying debt or April 24, 2021. On April 24, 2021, the interest rate swap agreement with certain lenders under the Colombian Credit Facility expired upon maturity of the underlying debt. As of December 31, 2021, there were no amounts outstanding under the Colombia Interest Rate Swap. The fair value of the Colombia Interest Rate Swap as of December 31, 2020 was less than $ 0.1 million and was included in Other non-current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Items Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis Assets Held and Used —The Company’s long-lived assets are recorded at amortized cost and, if impaired, are adjusted to fair value using Level 3 inputs. During the year ended December 31, 2021, certain long-lived assets held and used with a carrying value of $ 49.0 billion were written down to their net realizable value as a result of an asset impairment charge of $ 173.7 million. During the year ended December 31, 2020, certain long-lived assets held and used with a carrying value of $ 24.1 billion were written down to their net realizable value as a result of an asset impairment charge of $ 222.8 million. The asset impairment charges are recorded in Other operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. These adjustments were determined by comparing the estimated fair value utilizing projected future discounted cash flows to be provided from the long-lived assets to the asset’s carrying value. There were no other items measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during the year ended December 31, 2021. Fair Value of Financial Instruments —The Company’s financial instruments for which the carrying value reasonably approximates fair value at December 31, 2021 and 2020 include cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable and accounts payable. The Company’s estimates of fair value of its long-term obligations, including the current portion, are based primarily upon reported market values. For long-term debt not actively traded, fair value is estimated using either indicative price quotes or a discounted cash flow analysis using rates for debt with similar terms and maturities. As of December 31, 2021, the carrying value and fair value of long-term obligations, including the current portion, were $ 43.3 billion and $ 44.1 billion, respectively, of which $ 28.5 billion was measured using Level 1 inputs and $ 15.6 billion was measured using Level 2 inputs. As of December 31, 2020, the carrying value and fair value of long-term obligations, including the current portion, were $ 29.3 billion and $ 31.4 billion, respectively, of which $ 24.0 billion was measured using Level 1 inputs and $ 7.4 billion was measured using Level 2 inputs. 12. INCOME TAXES Beginning in the taxable year ended December 31, 2012, the Company has filed, and intends to continue to file, U.S. federal income tax returns as a REIT, and its domestic TRSs filed, and intend to continue to file, separate tax returns as required. The Company also files tax returns in various states and countries. The Company’s state tax returns reflect different combinations of the Company’s subsidiaries and are dependent on the connection each subsidiary has with a particular state and form of organization. The following information pertains to the Company’s income taxes on a consolidated basis. F-40 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) The income tax provision from continuing operations consisted of the following: Year Ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 Current: Federal $ ( 26.0 ) $ 8.7 $ ( 1.7 ) State ( 9.3 ) ( 10.7 ) ( 5.0 ) Foreign ( 267.7 ) ( 150.1 ) ( 48.2 ) Deferred: Federal 0.0 ( 1.0 ) 1.4 State ( 2.5 ) ( 1.0 ) 0.5 Foreign 43.7 24.5 53.2 Income tax (provision) benefit $ ( 261.8 ) $ ( 129.6 ) $ 0.2 The effective tax rate (“ETR”) on income from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the Company’s qualification for taxation as a REIT, as well as adjustments for state and foreign items. As a REIT, the Company may deduct earnings distributed to stockholders against the income generated by its REIT operations. In addition, the Company is able to offset certain income by utilizing its remaining NOLs, subject to specified limitations. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the change in the income tax provision was primarily attributable to increases in reserves for uncertain tax positions and tax audit settlements, primarily in the United States and Mexico, in the current year. In 2019, there was an income tax law change in India that allows companies to elect into an optional concessional tax regime. The new regime allows for a lower effective tax rate from approximately 35 % to approximately 25 % and no minimum alternative tax, while disallowing the benefit of the minimum alternative tax credits. As a result, the Company recorded a $ 113.0 million one-time tax benefit during the year ended December 31, 2019 arising from revaluing its net deferred tax liability. Reconciliation between the U.S. statutory rate and the effective rate from continuing operations is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 Statutory tax rate 21 % 21 % 21 % Adjustment to reflect REIT status (1) ( 21 ) ( 21 ) ( 21 ) Foreign taxes 3 4 3 Foreign withholding taxes 2 3 3 Uncertain tax positions 4 1 1 Changes in tax laws — — ( 6 ) Impact from restructuring — — ( 1 ) Changes in valuation allowance ( 0 ) ( 1 ) — Effective tax rate 9 % 7 % ( 0 )% _______________ (1) As a result of the ability to utilize the dividends paid deduction to offset the Company’s REIT income and gains. The domestic and foreign components of income from continuing operations before income taxes are as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 United States $ 2,517.4 $ 1,683.0 $ 1,527.0 Foreign 312.0 138.1 389.4 Total $ 2,829.4 $ 1,821.1 $ 1,916.4 F-41 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) The components of the net deferred tax asset and liability and related valuation allowance were as follows: December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Assets: Operating lease liability $ 1,171.8 $ 837.1 Net operating loss carryforwards 270.1 327.1 Accrued asset retirement obligations 228.0 187.8 Stock-based compensation 7.0 9.2 Unearned revenue 36.7 34.6 Unrealized loss on foreign currency 22.0 4.9 Other accruals and allowances 90.1 83.4 Nondeductible interest 76.2 60.9 Tax credits 82.4 49.3 Items not currently deductible and other 45.4 16.5 Liabilities: Depreciation and amortization ( 2,128.2 ) ( 1,140.3 ) Right-of-use asset ( 1,160.7 ) ( 824.0 ) Deferred rent ( 108.1 ) ( 92.9 ) Investment in affiliate (1) ( 0.6 ) ( 60.4 ) Other ( 2.1 ) ( 1.1 ) Subtotal ( 1,370.0 ) ( 507.9 ) Valuation allowance ( 329.3 ) ( 228.5 ) Net deferred tax liabilities $ ( 1,699.3 ) $ ( 736.4 ) _______________ (1) Includes basis difference associated with investment in subsidiary related to the InSite Acquisition. The Company provides valuation allowances if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management assesses the available evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets. Valuation allowances may be reversed if, based on changes in facts and circumstances, the net deferred tax assets have been determined to be realizable. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company has provided a valuation allowance of $ 329.3 million and $ 228.5 million, respectively, which primarily relates to foreign items. The increase in the valuation allowance for the year ending December 31, 2021 is due to uncertainty as to the timing of, and the Company’s ability to recover, net deferred tax assets in certain foreign operations in the foreseeable future, offset by reversals and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if objective evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight may be given to subjective evidence such as the Company’s projections for growth. A summary of the activity in the valuation allowance is as follows: 2021 2020 2019 Balance as of January 1, $ 228.5 $ 194.2 $ 151.9 Additions (1) 146.3 64.7 42.5 Usage, expiration and reversals ( 26.2 ) ( 22.0 ) — Foreign currency translation ( 19.3 ) ( 8.4 ) ( 0.2 ) Balance as of December 31, $ 329.3 $ 228.5 $ 194.2 _______________ (1) Includes net charges to expense and allowances established due to acquisition. The recoverability of the Company’s deferred tax assets has been assessed utilizing projections based on its current operations. Accordingly, the recoverability of the deferred tax assets is not dependent on material asset sales or other non-routine transactions. Based on its current outlook of future taxable income during the carryforward period, the Company believes that deferred tax assets, other than those for which a valuation allowance has been recorded, will be realized. F-42 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) At December 31, 2021, the Company had net federal, state and foreign operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income. If not utilized, the Company’s NOLs expire as follows: Years ended December 31, Federal State Foreign 2022 to 2026 $ 0.0 $ 260.5 $ 11.7 2027 to 2031 0.0 121.9 45.2 2032 to 2036 23.6 71.7 4.3 2037 to 2041 43.2 245.5 8.6 Indefinite carryforward 281.6 150.8 886.6 Total $ 348.4 $ 850.4 $ 956.4 As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would impact the ETR, if recognized, is $ 94.8 million and $ 105.9 million, respectively. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits for the year ended December 31, 2021 includes additions to the Company’s existing tax positions of $ 32.0 million. The Company expects the unrecognized tax benefits to change over the next 12 months if certain tax matters ultimately settle with the applicable taxing jurisdiction during this timeframe, or if the applicable statute of limitations lapses. The impact of the amount of such changes to previously recorded uncertain tax positions could range from zero to $ 35.1 million. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits are as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 Balance at January 1 $ 136.2 $ 175.6 $ 107.7 Additions based on tax positions related to the current year 7.5 4.7 33.3 Additions and reductions for tax positions of prior years (1) (2) ( 17.5 ) ( 5.0 ) 37.5 Foreign currency ( 3.7 ) ( 9.6 ) ( 1.6 ) Reduction as a result of the lapse of statute of limitations ( 4.9 ) ( 26.0 ) ( 1.3 ) Reduction as a result of effective settlements ( 8.8 ) ( 3.5 ) — Balance at December 31 $ 108.8 $ 136.2 $ 175.6 _______________ (1) Year ended December 31, 2021 includes adjustments of $( 16.6 ) million due to a reclassification of unrecognized tax benefits to penalties and income tax-related interest expense. (2) Year ended December 31, 2020 includes adjustments of $( 21.0 ) million for positions related to the Eaton Towers Acquisition that were revised in connection with settlements or effective settlements. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the statute of limitations on certain unrecognized tax benefits lapsed and certain positions were effectively settled, including effective settlements and revisions of prior year positions, which resulted in a decrease of $ 54.2 million in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the statute of limitations on certain unrecognized tax benefits lapsed and certain positions were effectively settled, including effective settlements and revisions of prior year positions related to the Eaton Towers Acquisition, which resulted in a decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $ 50.5 million. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the statute of limitations on certain unrecognized tax benefits lapsed and certain positions were effectively settled, which resulted in a decrease of $ 2.5 million in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits. The Company recorded penalties and tax-related interest expense to the tax provision of $ 69.5 million, $ 16.4 million and $ 10.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company reduced its liability for penalties and income tax-related interest expense related to uncertain tax positions by $ 14.6 million due to the expiration of the statute of limitations in certain jurisdictions and certain positions that were effectively settled. In addition, as a result of a settlement in the United States, $ 45.8 million has been reclassified to Accrued income tax payable as of December 31, 2021. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company reduced its liability for penalties and income tax-related interest expense related to uncertain tax positions by $ 4.8 million and $ 2.7 million, respectively, due to the expiration of the statute of limitations in certain jurisdictions and certain positions that were effectively settled. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the total amount of accrued income tax-related interest and penalties included in the consolidated balance sheets were $ 42.3 million and $ 34.4 million, respectively. F-43 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) The Company has filed for prior taxable years, and for its taxable year ended December 31, 2021 will file, numerous consolidated and separate income tax returns, including U.S. federal and state tax returns and foreign tax returns. The Company is subject to examination in the United States and various state and foreign jurisdictions for certain tax years. As a result of the Company’s ability to carryforward federal, state and foreign NOLs, the applicable tax years generally remain open to examination several years after the applicable loss carryforwards have been used or have expired. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the tax jurisdictions resulting from these examinations. The Company believes that adequate provisions have been made for income taxes for all periods through December 31, 2021. 13. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION Summary of Stock-Based Compensation Plans —The Company maintains equity incentive plans that provide for the grant of stock-based awards to its directors, officers and employees. The Company’s 2007 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended (the “2007 Plan”), provides for the grant of non-qualified and incentive stock options, as well as restricted stock units, restricted stock and other stock-based awards. Exercise prices for non-qualified and incentive stock options are not less than the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. Equity awards typically vest ratably, generally over four years for RSUs and stock options and three years for PSUs. Stock options generally expire 10 years from the date of grant. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had the ability to grant stock-based awards with respect to an aggregate of 5.9 million shares of common stock under the 2007 Plan. In connection with the CoreSite Acquisition, the Company assumed the remaining shares previously available for issuance under a plan approved by the CoreSite shareholders, which converted into 1.4 million shares of the Company’s common stock. These shares will be available for issuance under the 2007 Plan, however, will only be available for grants to certain employees and will not be available for issuance beyond the period when they would have been available under the CoreSite plan, or March 20, 2023, at which time they will no longer be available for grant. In addition, the Company maintains an employee stock purchase plan (the “ESPP”) pursuant to which eligible employees may purchase shares of the Company’s common stock on the last day of each bi-annual offering period at a 15 % discount from the lower of the closing market value on the first or last day of such offering period. The offering periods run from June 1 through November 30 and from December 1 through May 31 of each year. During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded the following stock-based compensation expenses: 2021 (1) 2020 (2) 2019 (2) Stock-based compensation expense $ 119.5 $ 120.8 $ 111.4 _______________ (1) For the year ended December 31, 2021, stock-based compensation expense consisted of $ 119.5 million, included in selling, general, administrative and development expense. (2) For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, stock-based compensation expense consisted of (i) $ 1.9 million and $ 1.8 million, respectively, included in Property costs of operations, (ii) $ 1.1 million and $ 1.0 million, respectively, included in Services costs of operations and (iii) $ 117.8 million and $ 108.6 million, respectively, included in selling, general, administrative and development expense. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, stock-based compensation expense capitalized as property and equipment was $ 1.7 million and $ 1.6 million, respectively. Stock Options —There were no options granted during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. The fair values of previously granted stock options were estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model based on the assumptions at the date of grant. The intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $ 176.7 million, $ 176.3 million and $ 145.5 million, respectively.

During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company redeemed 100 % of Macquarie’s combined holdings in ATC TIPL, for total consideration of INR 12.9 billion (approximately $ 173.2 million at the date of redemption).

Thereafter, AT&T shall have the right to renew such lease for up to five successive five-year terms. F-51 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) Other Contingencies —The Company is subject to income tax and other taxes in the geographic areas where it holds assets or operates, and periodically receives notifications of audits, assessments or other actions by taxing authorities. Taxing authorities may issue notices or assessments while audits are being conducted. In certain jurisdictions, taxing authorities may issue assessments with minimal examination. These notices and assessments do not represent amounts that the Company is obligated to pay and are often not reflective of the actual tax liability for which the Company will ultimately be liable. In the process of responding to assessments of taxes that the Company believes are not enforceable, the Company avails itself of both administrative and judicial remedies. The Company evaluates the circumstances of each notification or assessment based on the information available and, in those instances in which the Company does not anticipate a successful defense of positions taken in its tax filings, a liability is recorded in the appropriate amount based on the underlying assessment. On December 5, 2016, the Company received an income tax assessment of Essar Telecom Infrastructure Private Limited (“ETIPL”) from the India Income Tax Department (the “Tax Department”) for the fiscal year ending 2008 in the amount of INR 4.75 billion ($ 69.8 million on the date of assessment) related to capital contributions. The Company challenged the assessment before the Office of Commissioner of Income Tax - Appeals, which ruled in the Company’s favor in January 2018. However, the Tax Department has appealed this ruling at a higher appellate authority. The Company estimates that there is a more likely than not probability that the Company’s position will be sustained upon appeal. Accordingly, no liability has been recorded. Additionally, the assessment was made with respect to transactions that took place in the tax year commencing in 2007, prior to the Company’s acquisition of ETIPL. Under the Company’s definitive acquisition agreement with ETIPL, the seller is obligated to indemnify and defend the Company with respect to any tax-related liability that may arise from activities prior to March 31, 2010. Guaranties and Indemnifications —The Company enters into agreements from time to time in the ordinary course of business pursuant to which it agrees to guarantee or indemnify third parties for certain claims. The Company has also entered into purchase and sale agreements relating to the sale or acquisition of assets containing customary indemnification provisions. The Company’s indemnification obligations under these agreements generally are limited solely to damages resulting from breaches of representations and warranties or covenants under the applicable agreements. In addition, payments under such indemnification clauses are generally conditioned on the other party making a claim that is subject to whatever defenses the Company may have and are governed by dispute resolution procedures specified in the particular agreement. Further, the Company’s obligations under these agreements may be limited in duration and amount, and in some instances, the Company may have recourse against third parties for payments made by the Company. The Company has not historically made any material payments under these agreements and, as of December 31, 2021, is not aware of any agreements that could result in a material payment. 20.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS Property F-52 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) Communications Sites and Related Communications Infrastructure —The Company’s primary business is leasing space on multitenant communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, wireless data providers, government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries. Data Centers —During the fourth quarter of 2021, as a result of the CoreSite Acquisition, the Company established the Data Centers segment as a reportable segment. The Data Centers segment relates to data center facilities and related assets that the Company owns and operates in the United States. The Data Centers segment offers different services from, and requires different resources, skill sets and marketing strategies than, the existing property operating segment in the U.S. & Canada. Prior to this revision, the Company operated in five property business segments: (i) U.S. & Canada property, (ii) Asia-Pacific property (iii) Africa property, (iii) Europe property and (iv) Latin America property. As of December 31, 2021, the Company’s property operations consisted of the following: • U.S. & Canada: property operations in Canada and the United States; • Asia-Pacific: property operations in Australia, Bangladesh, India and the Philippines; • Africa: property operations in Burkina Faso, Ghana, Kenya, Niger, Nigeria, South Africa and Uganda; • Europe: property operations in France, Germany, Poland and Spain; • Latin America: property operations in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico, Paraguay and Peru; and • Data Centers: data center property operations in the United States. Services —The Company’s Services segment offers tower-related services in the United States, including AZP and structural analysis, which primarily support its site leasing business, including the addition of new tenants and equipment on its sites. The services segment is a strategic business unit that offers different services from, and requires different resources, skill sets and marketing strategies than, the property operating segments. The accounting policies applied in compiling segment information below are similar to those described in note 1. Among other factors, in evaluating financial performance in each business segment, management uses segment gross margin and segment operating profit. The Company defines segment gross margin as segment revenue less segment operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation expense recorded in costs of operations; Depreciation, amortization and accretion; Selling, general, administrative and development expense; and Other operating expenses. The Company defines segment operating profit as segment gross margin less Selling, general, administrative and development expense attributable to the segment, excluding stock-based compensation expense and corporate expenses. These measures of segment gross margin and segment operating profit are also before Interest income, Interest expense, Gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations, Other income (expense), Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and Income tax benefit (provision). The categories of expenses indicated above, such as depreciation, have been excluded from segment operating performance as they are not considered in the review of information or the evaluation of results by management. There are no significant revenues resulting from transactions between the Company’s operating segments. All intercompany transactions are eliminated to reconcile segment results and assets to the consolidated statements of operations and consolidated balance sheets. Summarized financial information concerning the Company’s reportable segments for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 is shown in the following tables. The “Other” column (i) represents amounts excluded from specific segments, such as business development operations, stock-based compensation expense and corporate expenses included in Selling, general, administrative and development expense; Other operating expenses; Interest income; Interest expense; Gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations; and Other income (expense), and (ii) reconciles segment operating profit to Income from continuing operations before income taxes.

We have based those forward-looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future results. When we use words such as “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects” or similar expressions, we are making forward-looking statements. Examples of forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, our expectations regarding the impacts of the coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic and actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and our operating results, statements we make regarding the Pending Telxius Acquisition (as defined in this Annual Report), future prospects of growth in the communications site leasing industry, the effects of consolidation among companies in our industry and among our tenants and other competitive and financial pressures, changes in zoning, tax and other laws and regulations and administrative and judicial decisions, economic, political and other events, particularly those relating to our international operations, our future capital expenditure levels, our ability to maintain or increase our market share, our plans to fund our future liquidity needs, our substantial leverage and debt service obligations, our future financing transactions, our future operating results, the level of future expenditures by companies in this industry and other trends in this industry, the impact of technology changes on our industry and our business, our ability to remain qualified for taxation as a real estate investment trust (REIT), the amount and timing of any future distributions including those we are required to make as a REIT, natural disasters and similar events and our ability to protect our rights to the land under our towers. These statements are based on our management’s beliefs and assumptions, which in turn are based on currently available information. These assumptions could prove inaccurate. These forward-looking statements may be found under the captions “Business” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” as well as in this Annual Report generally. You should keep in mind that any forward-looking statement we make in this Annual Report or elsewhere speaks only as of the date on which we make it. New risks and uncertainties arise from time to time, and it is impossible for us to predict these events or how they may affect us. In any event, these and other important factors, including those set forth in Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption “Risk Factors,” may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by our forward-looking statements. We have no duty, and do not intend, to update or revise the forward-looking statements we make in this Annual Report, except as may be required by law. In light of these risks and uncertainties, you should keep in mind that the future events or circumstances described in any forward-looking statement we make in this Annual Report or elsewhere might ii Table of Contents not occur. References in this Annual Report to “we,” “our” and the “Company” refer to American Tower Corporation and its predecessor, as applicable, individually and collectively with its subsidiaries as the context requires. iii Table of Contents PART I ITEM 1.

We refer to this business as our property operations, which accounted for 99% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020. We also offer tower-related services in the United States, which we refer to as our services operations. These services include site application, zoning and permitting and structural analysis, which primarily support our site leasing business, including the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites. Since inception, we have grown our communications real estate portfolio through acquisitions, long-term lease arrangements and site development. Our portfolio primarily consists of towers that we own and towers that we operate pursuant to long-term lease arrangements, as well as distributed antenna system (“DAS”) networks, which provide seamless coverage solutions in certain in-building and outdoor wireless environments. In addition to the communications sites in our portfolio, we manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements. We also hold other telecommunications infrastructure, fiber and property interests that we lease primarily to communications service providers and third-party tower operators. In 2020, we added approximately 3,000 communications sites to our portfolio, primarily in the United States, and launched operations in Canada and Australia as part of our acquisition of InSite Wireless Group, LLC (“InSite,” and the acquisition, the “InSite Acquisition”). We also launched operations in Poland through an agreement to acquire communications sites from Electronic Control Systems Spółka Akcyjna, added 530 communications sites to our portfolio in Latin America through our agreement with Entel PCS Telecomunicaciones S.A. and Entel Peru S.A. (the “Entel Acquisition”) and added 564 communications sites to our portfolio in Europe through our agreements with Orange S.A. (the “Orange Acquisition”). As of December 31, 2020, our communications real estate portfolio of 185,641 communications sites included 43,146 communications sites in the U.S. & Canada, 75,772 communications sites in Asia-Pacific, 19,863 communications sites in Africa, 5,331 communications sites in Europe and 41,529 communications sites in Latin America, as well as urban telecommunications assets in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, India, Mexico and South Africa and other property interests in the United States and Australia. On January 13, 2021, we entered into two agreements with Telxius Telecom, S.A. (“Telxius”), a subsidiary of Telefónica, S.A., pursuant to which we expect to acquire Telxius’ European and Latin American tower divisions, comprising approximately 31,000 communications sites in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Germany, Peru and Spain, for approximately 7.7 billion Euros (“EUR”) (approximately $9.4 billion at the date of signing) (the “Pending Telxius Acquisition”), subject to limited adjustments. The Pending Telxius Acquisition is expected to close in tranches beginning in the second quarter of 2021, subject to customary closing conditions, including government and regulatory approval. We operate as a real estate investment trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes (“REIT”). Accordingly, we generally are not required to pay U.S. federal income taxes on income generated by our REIT operations, including the income derived from leasing space on our towers, as we receive a dividends paid deduction for distributions to stockholders that generally offsets our REIT income and gains. However, we remain obligated to pay U.S. federal income taxes on earnings from our domestic taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRSs”). In addition, our international assets and operations, regardless of their classification for U.S. tax purposes, continue to be subject to taxation in the jurisdictions where those assets are held or those operations are conducted. The use of TRSs enables us to continue to engage in certain businesses and jurisdictions while complying with REIT qualification requirements. We may, from time to time, change the election of previously designated TRSs to be included as part of the REIT. As of December 31, 2020, our REIT-qualified businesses included our U.S. tower leasing business and a majority of our U.S. indoor DAS networks business and services segment, as well as most of our operations in Mexico, Germany, Costa Rica, Nigeria, France, Canada and Australia. During the fourth quarter of 2020, as a result of the InSite Acquisition, we updated our reportable segments to rename U.S. property and Asia property to U.S. & Canada property and Asia-Pacific property, respectively. We continue to report our results in six segments – U.S. & Canada property, Asia-Pacific property, Africa property, Europe property, Latin America property and services. This change was made to better align the names of our reportable segments with the geographical areas of our business operations following the InSite Acquisition. The change of our reportable segments names is solely reflective of the inclusion of Canada and Australia in our business operations, as a result of the InSite Acquisition, and had no impact on our consolidated financial statements for any prior periods. 1 Table of Contents Products and Services Property Operations Our property operations accounted for 99%, 98% and 98% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our revenue is primarily generated from tenant leases. Our tenants lease space on our communications real estate, where they install and maintain their equipment. Rental payments vary considerably depending upon numerous factors, including, but not limited to, amount, type and position of tenant equipment on the tower, remaining tower capacity and tower location. Our costs typically include ground rent (which is primarily fixed under long-term lease agreements with annual cost escalations) and power and fuel costs, some or all of which may be passed through to our tenants, as well as property taxes and repair and maintenance expenses. Our property operations have generated consistent growth in revenue and typically have low cash flow volatility due to the following characteristics: • Long-term tenant leases with contractual rent escalations. In general, our tenant leases with wireless carriers have initial non-cancellable terms of five to ten years with multiple renewal terms, with provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease, typically annually, based on a fixed escalation percentage (averaging approximately 3% in the United States) or an inflationary index in most of our international markets, or a combination of both. Based upon foreign currency exchange rates and the tenant leases in place as of December 31, 2020, we expect to generate nearly $59 billion of non-cancellable tenant lease revenue over future periods, before the impact of straight-line lease accounting. • Consistent demand for our sites. As a result of rapidly growing usage of mobile data and other wireless services and the corresponding wireless industry capital spending trends in the markets we serve, we anticipate consistent demand for our communications sites. We believe that our global asset base positions us well to benefit from the increasing proliferation of advanced wireless devices and the increasing usage of high bandwidth applications on those devices. We have the ability to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our sites, which typically results in incremental revenue and modest incremental costs. Our site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with a solid platform for new business opportunities, which has historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth. • High lease renewal rates. Our tenants tend to renew leases because suitable alternative sites may not exist or be available and repositioning a site in their network may be expensive and may adversely affect network quality. Historically, churn has averaged approximately 1% to 2% of tenant billings per year. We define churn as tenant billings lost when a tenant cancels or does not renew its lease or, in limited circumstances, when the lease rates on existing leases are reduced. We derive our churn rate for a given year by dividing our tenant billings lost on this basis by our prior-year tenant billings. As discussed in Item 7 of this Annual Report under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Executive Overview,” we experienced elevated levels of churn in recent years due to carrier consolidation-driven churn in India. We anticipate that our churn rate in our Asia-Pacific property segment will moderate over time, however, in the immediate term, we believe that our churn rate may remain elevated, primarily due to the recent court rulings by the Indian Supreme Court, as set forth in Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption “Risk Factors—Our business, and that of our tenants, is subject to laws, regulations and administrative and judicial decisions, and changes thereto, that could restrict our ability to operate our business as we currently do or impact our competitive landscape.” Additionally, we expect that our churn rate in our U.S. & Canada property segment will be elevated for a period of several years due to contractual lease cancellations and non-renewals pursuant to the terms of our master lease agreement with T-Mobile US, Inc. (“T-Mobile,” and the agreement, the “T-Mobile MLA”) entered into in September 2020. • High operating margins. Incremental operating costs associated with adding new tenants or equipment to an existing communications site are relatively minimal. Therefore, as tenants or equipment are added, the substantial majority of incremental revenue flows through to gross margin and operating profit. In addition, in many of our international markets certain expenses, such as ground rent or power and fuel costs, are reimbursed or shared by our tenant base. • Low maintenance capital expenditures. On average, we require relatively low amounts of annual capital expenditures to maintain our communications sites. Our property business includes the operation of communications sites and managed networks, the leasing of property interests, and, in select markets, the operation of fiber and the provision of backup power through shared generators. Our presence in a number of markets at different relative stages of wireless development provides us with significant diversification and long-term growth potential. Our property segments accounted for the following percentage of consolidated total revenue for the years 2 Table of Contents ended December 31,: 2020 2019 2018 U.S. & Canada 56 % 55 % 51 % Asia-Pacific 14 % 16 % 21 % Africa 11 % 8 % 7 % Europe 2 % 2 % 2 % Latin America 16 % 18 % 17 % Communications Sites. Approximately 95%, 95% and 96% of revenue in our property segments was attributable to our communications sites, excluding DAS networks, for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We lease space on our communications sites to tenants providing a diverse range of communications services, including cellular voice and data, broadcasting, mobile video and a number of other applications. In addition, in many of our international markets, we receive pass-through revenue from our tenants to cover certain costs, including power and fuel costs and ground rent. Our top tenants by revenue for each property segment are as follows for the year ended December 31, 2020: • U.S. & Canada: AT&T Inc. (“AT&T”); T-Mobile; and Verizon Wireless accounted for an aggregate of 89% of U.S. & Canada property segment revenue. • Asia-Pacific: Vodafone Idea Limited; Bharti Airtel Limited (“Airtel”); and Reliance Jio accounted for an aggregate of 87% of Asia-Pacific property segment revenue. • Africa: Airtel; and MTN Group Limited (“MTN”) accounted for an aggregate of 68% of Africa property segment revenue. • Europe: Telefónica S.A. (“Telefónica”); Bouygues; and Free accounted for an aggregate of 69% of Europe property segment revenue. • Latin America: AT&T; Telefónica; and América Móvil accounted for an aggregate of 56% of Latin America property segment revenue. Accordingly, we are subject to certain risks, as set forth in Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption “Risk Factors—A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of tenants, and we are sensitive to changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our tenants.” In addition, we are subject to risks related to our international operations, as set forth under the caption “Risk Factors—Our foreign operations are subject to economic, political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position, including risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.” Managed Networks, Fiber and Related Assets, Property Interests and Shared Generators. In addition to our communications sites, we also own and operate several types of managed network solutions, provide communications site management services to third parties, manage and lease property interests under carrier or other third-party communications sites, provide the right to use fiber and provide back-up power sources to tenants at our sites. The balance of our property segment revenue not attributable to our communications sites was attributable to these items. • Managed Networks. We own and operate DAS networks in the United States and certain international markets. We obtain rights from property owners to install and operate in-building DAS networks, and we grant rights to wireless service providers to attach their equipment to our installations. We also offer a small portfolio of outdoor DAS networks as a complementary shared infrastructure solution for our tenants in the United States and in certain international markets. Typically, we have designed, built and operated our outdoor DAS networks in areas in which zoning restrictions or other barriers may prevent or delay deployment of more traditional wireless communications sites, such as macro tower sites. We also hold lease rights and easement interests on rooftops capable of hosting communications equipment in locations where towers are generally not a viable solution based on area characteristics. In addition, we provide management services to property owners in the United States who elect to retain full rights to their property while simultaneously marketing the rooftop for wireless communications equipment installation. As the demand for advanced wireless services in urban markets evolves, we continue to evaluate a variety of infrastructure solutions, including small cells and other network architectures that may support our tenants’ networks in these areas. • Fiber and Related Assets. We own and operate fiber and related assets in the United States and certain international markets. We currently provide the right to use such fiber and related assets to communications and internet service providers and third-party operators to support their telecommunications infrastructure. We expect to continue to evaluate opportunities to invest selectively in and expand these and other similar assets in the future as part of advanced network deployments. 3 Table of Contents • Property Interests . We own portfolios of property interests in Australia, Canada and the United States, including land under carrier or other third-party communications sites, which provide recurring cash flow under complementary leasing arrangements. • Shared Generators . We have contracts with certain of our tenants in the United States pursuant to which we provide access to shared backup power generators. Services Operations We offer tower-related services in the United States, including site application, zoning and permitting and structural analysis services. Our services operations primarily support our site leasing business, including through the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites. This segment accounted for 1%, 2% and 2% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Site Application, Zoning and Permitting . We engage in site application services on our own behalf in connection with our tower development projects, as well as on behalf of our tenants. We typically work with our tenants’ engineers to determine the geographic areas where new communications sites will best address the tenants’ needs and meet their coverage objectives. Once a new site is identified, we acquire the rights to the land or structure on which the site will be constructed, and we manage the permitting process to ensure all necessary approvals are obtained to construct and operate the communications site. Structural Analysis. We offer structural analysis services to wireless carriers in connection with the installation of their communications equipment on our towers. Our team of engineers can evaluate whether a tower structure can support the additional burden of the new equipment or if an upgrade is needed, which enables our tenants to better assess potential sites before making an installation decision. Our structural analysis capabilities enable us to provide higher quality service to our existing tenants by, among other things, reducing the time required to achieve on-air readiness, while also providing opportunities to offer structural analysis services to third parties. Strategy Operational Strategy As the use of wireless services on handsets, tablets and other advanced mobile devices grows and evolves, there is a corresponding increase in demand for the communications infrastructure required to deploy current and future generations of wireless communications technologies. To capture this demand, our primary operational focus is to (i) increase the occupancy of our existing communications real estate portfolio to support global connectivity, (ii) invest in and selectively grow our communications real estate portfolio, (iii) further improve our operational performance and efficiency, including through platform expansion initiatives, and (iv) maintain a strong balance sheet. We believe these efforts to meet our tenants’ needs will support and enhance our ability to capitalize on the growth in demand for wireless infrastructure. In addition, we expect to explore new opportunities to enhance or extend our shared communications infrastructure businesses, including those that may make our assets incrementally more attractive to new tenants, or to existing tenants for new uses, and those that increase our operational efficiency. • Increase the occupancy of our existing communications real estate portfolio to support global connectivity. We believe that our highest incremental returns will be achieved by leasing additional space on our existing communications sites. Increasing demand for wireless services in our served markets has resulted in significant capital spending by major wireless carriers and other connectivity providers. As a result, we anticipate growing demand for our communications sites because they are attractively located and typically have capacity available for additional tenants and equipment. In the United States, incremental carrier network activity is being driven by 4G network densification initiatives as well as the early stages of multiple concurrent 5G network deployments. In our international markets, carriers are increasingly deploying more advanced network technologies such as 4G and, in the case of our international markets with more mature network technology, 5G, while continuing to selectively augment legacy networks. We believe that the majority of our towers have capacity for additional tenants and that substantially all of our towers that are currently at or near full structural capacity can be upgraded or augmented to meet future tenant demand with relatively modest capital investment. Therefore, we will continue to target our sales and marketing activities to increase the utilization and return on investment of our existing communications sites. • Invest in and selectively grow our communications real estate portfolio to meet our tenants’ needs. We seek opportunities to invest in and grow our operations through our capital expenditure program, new site construction and acquisitions. We believe we can achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns by pursuing such investments. In addition, we seek to secure property interests under our communications sites to improve operating margins as we reduce our cash operating expense related to ground leases. A significant portion of our inorganic growth has been focused on properties with lower initial tenancy because we believe that over time we can significantly increase tenancy levels, and therefore, drive strong returns on those assets. 4 Table of Contents • Further improve our operational performance and efficiency. We continue to seek opportunities to improve our operational performance throughout the organization. This includes investing in our systems and people as we strive to improve efficiency and provide superior service to our tenants. To achieve this, we intend to continue to focus on customer service initiatives, such as reducing cycle times for key functions, including lease processing and tower structural analysis. We are also focused on developing and implementing renewable power solutions across our footprint to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and help improve the overall efficiency of the communications infrastructure and wireless industries through our sustainability and platform expansion initiatives. We also expect to explore additional ways to use our platform expansion initiatives to enhance the efficiency of our operations over time. • Maintain a strong balance sheet. We remain committed to disciplined financial policies, which we believe result in our ability to maintain a strong balance sheet and will support our overall strategy and focus on asset growth and operational excellence. As a result of these policies, we currently have investment grade credit ratings. We continue to focus on maintaining a robust liquidity position and, as of December 31, 2020, had $4.9 billion of available liquidity. We believe that our investment grade credit ratings provide us consistent access to the capital markets and our liquidity provides us the ability to continue to invest in growing and augmenting our business. Capital Allocation Strategy The objective of our capital allocation strategy is to simultaneously increase adjusted funds from operations per share and our return on invested capital over the long term. To maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT, we are required annually to distribute an amount equal to at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain) to our stockholders. After complying with our REIT distribution requirements, we plan to continue to allocate our available capital among investment alternatives that meet or exceed our return on investment criteria, while taking into account the repayment of debt consistent with our financial policies. • Capital expenditure program. We expect to continue to invest in and expand our existing communications real estate portfolio through our capital expenditure program. This includes capital expenditures associated with site maintenance, increasing the capacity of our existing sites and projects such as new site construction, land interest acquisitions and power solutions. • Acquisitions. We intend to pursue acquisitions of communications sites and other telecommunications infrastructure in our existing or new markets where we can meet or exceed our risk-adjusted return on investment criteria. The risk-adjusted hurdle rates used to evaluate acquisition opportunities consider additional factors such as the country and counterparties involved, investment and economic climate, legal and regulatory conditions and industry risk, among others. • Return excess capital to stockholders . If we have excess capital available after funding (i) our required distributions, (ii) capital expenditures, (iii) the repayment of debt consistent with our financial policies and (iv) anticipated future investments, including acquisition and select innovation opportunities, we will seek to return such excess capital to stockholders, including through our stock repurchase programs. International Growth Strategy We believe that, in certain international markets, we can create substantial value by either establishing a new, or expanding our existing, communications real estate leasing business. Therefore, we expect we will continue to seek international growth opportunities where we believe our risk-adjusted return objectives can be achieved. We strive to maintain a diversified approach to our international growth strategy by operating in a geographically diverse array of markets in a variety of stages of wireless network development. Our international growth strategy includes a disciplined, individualized market evaluation, in which we conduct the following analyses, among others: • Country analysis. Prior to entering a new market, we conduct an extensive review of the country’s historical and projected macroeconomic fundamentals, including inflation and foreign currency exchange rate trends, demographics, capital markets, tax regime and investment alternatives, and the general business, political and legal environments, including property rights and regulatory regime. • Wireless industry analysis. To confirm the presence of sufficient demand to support an independent tower leasing model, we analyze the competitiveness of the country’s wireless market. This includes an evaluation of the industry’s pricing environment, past and potential consolidation and the stage of its wireless network development. Characteristics that result in an attractive investment opportunity include (i) multiple competitive wireless service providers who are actively seeking to invest in deploying voice and data networks and (ii) ongoing or expected deployment of incremental spectrum from recent or anticipated auctions. • Opportunity and counterparty analysis. Once an investment opportunity is identified within a geographic area with an attractive wireless industry, we conduct a multifaceted opportunity and counterparty analysis. This includes evaluating (i) the type of transaction, (ii) its ability to meet our risk-adjusted return criteria given the country and the 5 Table of Contents counterparties involved, including the anticipated anchor tenant and (iii) how the transaction fits within our long-term strategic objectives, including future potential investment and expansion within the region. Regulatory Matters Towers, Antennas and Fiber. Our U.S. and international tower leasing businesses are subject to national, state and local regulatory requirements with respect to the registration, siting, construction, lighting, marking and maintenance of our towers. In the United States, the construction of new towers or modifications to existing towers may require pre-approval by the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) and the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”), depending on factors such as tower height and proximity to public airfields. Towers requiring pre-approval must be registered with the FCC and maintained in accordance with FAA standards. Similar requirements regarding pre-approval of the construction and modification of towers are imposed by regulators in other countries. Non-compliance with applicable tower-related requirements may lead to monetary penalties or site deconstruction orders. Certain of our international operations are subject to regulatory requirements with respect to licensing, registration, permitting and public listings. In India, our subsidiary, ATC Telecom Infrastructure Private Limited (“ATC TIPL”), holds an Infrastructure Provider Category-I (“IP-I”) Registration Certificate issued by the Indian Ministry of Communications and Information Technology, which permits us to provide tower space to companies licensed as telecommunications service providers under the Indian Telegraph Act of 1885. As a condition to the IP-I, the Indian government has the right to take over telecommunications infrastructure in the case of emergency or war. Additionally, in 2018, ATC TIPL issued non-convertible debentures, which are listed on the National Stock Exchange of India. Although the debt is held by another subsidiary of ours and is eliminated in consolidation, ATC TIPL is still subject to the listing requirements of such exchange. In Africa, our subsidiaries in Ghana, Kenya, Niger, Nigeria and Uganda are required to hold a license in order to establish and maintain passive telecommunications infrastructure services and DAS networks for communications service providers. In Burkina Faso, a new licensing regime was recently enacted which required our subsidiary there to be licensed. Additionally, in Uganda, our subsidiary is subject to review for three years commencing in 2020 by a monitoring trustee regarding compliance with certain conditions of approval of our acquisition in 2019 of Eaton Towers Holdings Limited (“Eaton Towers,” and the acquisition, the “Eaton Towers Acquisition”). In Latin America, our subsidiaries in Chile and Argentina hold licenses for the provision of passive telecommunications infrastructure and, in Argentina, for leasing of fiber. The subsidiaries that hold our fiber business in Mexico and Brazil are also licensed and regulated as concession holders and permit holders authorized to provide telecommunications services. In many of the markets in which we operate, we are required to provide tower space to service providers on a non-discriminatory basis, subject to the negotiation of mutually agreeable terms. Our international business operations may be subject to increased licensing fees or ownership restrictions. For example, in South Africa, the Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment Act, 2003 (the “BBBEE Act”) has established a legislative framework for the promotion of economic empowerment of South African citizens disadvantaged by Apartheid. Accordingly, the BBBEE Act and related codes measure BBBEE Act compliance and good corporate practice by the inclusion of certain ownership, management control, employment equity and other metrics for companies that do business there. In Kenya, our regulator requires all holders of a commercial license to issue at least 30% of their shares to Kenyans within three years of receiving the license unless a waiver is obtained to extend such period of compliance by a year. In addition, certain municipalities have sought to impose permit fees based upon structural or operational requirements of towers and certain regional and other governmental bodies have sought to impose levies or other forms of fees. Our foreign operations may be affected if a country’s regulatory authority restricts, revokes or modifies spectrum licenses of certain wireless service providers or implements limitations on foreign ownership. In all countries where we operate, we are subject to zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by local authorities or community organizations. While these regulations vary, they typically require tower owners or tenants to obtain approval from local authorities or community standards organizations prior to tower construction or the addition of a new antenna to an existing tower. Local zoning authorities and community residents often oppose construction in their communities, which can delay or prevent new tower construction, new antenna installation or site upgrade projects, thereby limiting our ability to respond to tenant demand. This opposition and existing or new zoning regulations can increase costs associated with new tower construction, tower modifications or additions of new antennas to a site or site upgrades, as well as adversely affect the associated timing or cost of such projects. Further, additional regulations may be adopted that cause delays or result in additional costs to us or changes in the competitive landscape that may negatively affect our business. These factors could materially and adversely affect our operations. In the United States, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 prohibits any action by state and local authorities that would discriminate between different providers of wireless services or ban altogether the construction, modification or placement of communications sites. It also prohibits state or local restrictions based on the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent the facilities comply with FCC regulations. Further, in 6 Table of Contents February 2012, the United States government adopted regulations requiring that local and state governments approve modifications or colocations that qualify as eligible facilities under the regulations. Portions of our business are subject to additional regulations, for example, in a number of states throughout the United States, certain of our subsidiaries hold Competitive Local Exchange Carrier (CLEC) or other status, in connection with the operation of our outdoor DAS networks business. In addition, we, or our tenants, may be subject to new regulatory policies in certain jurisdictions from time to time that may materially and adversely affect our business or the demand for our communications sites. Environmental Matters. Our U.S. and international operations are subject to various national, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the management, use, storage, disposal, emission and remediation of, and exposure to, hazardous and non-hazardous substances, materials and wastes and the siting of our towers. We may be required to obtain permits, pay additional property taxes, comply with regulatory requirements and make certain informational filings related to hazardous substances or devices used to provide power such as batteries, generators and fuel at our sites. Violations of these types of regulations could subject us to fines or criminal sanctions. Additionally, in the United States and in other countries where we operate, before constructing a new tower or adding an antenna to an existing site, we must review and evaluate the impact of the action to determine whether it may significantly affect the environment and whether we must disclose any significant impacts in an environmental assessment. If a tower or new antenna might have a material adverse impact on the environment, FCC or other governmental approval of the tower or antenna could be significantly delayed. Health and Safety. In the United States and in other countries where we operate, we are subject to various national, state and local laws regarding employee health and safety, including protection from radio frequency exposure. Additionally, and in response to various national, state and local laws and guidance enacted in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented work-from-home arrangements and travel restrictions for our employees where practicable, as well as and other modifications to our business practices. Competition Our industry is highly competitive. We compete, both for new business and for the acquisition of assets, with other public tower companies, such as Crown Castle International Corp., SBA Communications Corporation, Telesites S.A.B. de C.V. and Cellnex Telecom, S.A., wireless carrier tower consortia such as Indus Towers Limited and private tower companies, private equity sponsored firms, carrier-affiliated tower companies, independent wireless carriers, tower owners, broadcasters and owners of non-communications sites, including rooftops, utility towers, water towers and other alternative structures. We believe that site location and capacity, network density, price, quality and speed of service have been, and will continue to be, significant competitive factors affecting owners, operators and managers of communications sites. Our services business competes with a variety of companies offering individual, or combinations of, competing services. The field of competitors includes site application consultants, zoning consultants, real estate firms, right-of-way consultants, structural engineering firms, tower owners/managers, telecommunications equipment vendors who can provide turnkey site development services through multiple subcontractors and our tenants’ personnel. We believe that our tenants base their decisions for services on various criteria, including a company’s experience, local reputation, price and time for completion of a project. For more information on demand trends in our industry, see Item 7 of this Annual Report under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Executive Overview.” Human Capital Resources As of December 31, 2020, we employed 5,618 full-time individuals, including 1,849 employees based in the United States and 3,769 employees based internationally. We consider our employee relations to be good. Our teams representing our 22 countries around the world are our most important assets and fundamental to our success. Aligned with our business strategy, our human capital strategy focuses on developing and delivering solutions to attract, develop, engage and retain top diverse talent in each of the countries where we operate. Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. Diversity, equity and inclusion are top priorities for us. A critical factor in our success is ensuring that each of these remains at the core of our business culture, infusing fresh ideas, helping us remain connected to our tenants in a dynamic global market and ensuring mutual respect guides us in our interactions both internally and externally. Half of the members of our board of directors are either female or part of a minority group. In addition, our recruiting efforts consistently include strategies to build diverse candidate pipelines and create an environment that maintains a diverse team of global employees. As part of our efforts to help employees succeed in their roles and have access to career opportunities, we 7 Table of Contents create a variety of development opportunities unique to each market. For example, in the United States, we have programs designed to enhance opportunities for our female leaders, such as Strategies for Success, the Simmons Women’s Leadership Conference and the Women’s Wireless Leadership Forum of the Wireless Infrastructure Association. Additionally, in 2020, we implemented several new initiatives designed to address racial injustice and enhance our diversity. These include CEO-led listening sessions with employees of color, a pledge of $1.0 million from the American Tower Foundation to counter systemic racism, expanding recruiting efforts at Historically Black Colleges and Universities, increasing diversity and inclusion training for employees and managers and launching an employee-led CEO Advisory Council that will identify diversity action items and next steps for our diversity and inclusion efforts. Talent Development. As a critical investment in our capacity to provide tenants with outstanding support and customer service, we offer development programs and on-demand opportunities to cultivate talent throughout our global organization. We have 7,000 resources in up to five languages that focus on job-specific training and general topics like productivity, collaboration and project management. We create and customize courses to meet regional needs and update these courses regularly to address changing marketplace dynamics and employee interests. We also have a comprehensive talent-management review process to develop future leaders and ensure effective succession planning. Our Latin America, Europe and Africa teams use the TalentPrint data analytics solution to enhance performance and talent management assessments, as well as data for targeted individual employee development and organizational succession planning. Developing our managers is critical to our success, and resources and tools are provided to all levels of management. For example, the Management Development at American Tower program provides continuous development opportunities through training led by American Tower leaders. Managers learn tools and best practices that enable both management and team success, and that build and strengthen competencies to better respond to the needs of a growing and increasingly complex organization. Our annual Advanced Leadership Development Program, in collaboration with the INSEAD executive education program, provides our next generation leaders in Latin America, Europe and Africa with a twelve-week intensive workshop to enhance management and leadership skills. Additionally, the Leadership Excellence at American Tower Program supports senior leaders’ development through its partnership with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Participants learn from leading experts on topics like global strategy and leading in uncertain times. Workplace Safety. We are committed to the safety of our employees and surrounding communities. Depending on the role, team members are required to pass and complete regular safety training courses and follow specific tower and site safety protocols using complex operational manuals. A key component of our culture is a strong commitment to incident reporting and corrective actions, as well as a comprehensive program for ensuring vendor compliance with safety standards and certifications. Our strict adherence to the rigorous standards set forth by the relevant government agencies and other authorities, such as the Telecommunications Infrastructure Registered Apprenticeship Program and Telecommunications Industry Association, is critical to ensuring our towers are structurally safe for field personnel, vendors, tenants and communities. Health and Wellness. As we navigate COVID-19, our top priority continues to be the health and safety of our employees, their families, our tenants, suppliers and surrounding communities. We have taken a variety of actions to ensure the continued availability of our communications sites, while also focusing on the well-being of our people. These measures include providing support for our tenants remotely, requiring work-from-home arrangements, restricting travel for our teams where practicable, safety equipment and COVID-19 training for essential employees working to maintain our sites, as well as other modifications to our business practices.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Risks Related to Our Business Strategy A significant decrease in leasing demand for our communications infrastructure would materially and adversely affect our business and operating results, and we cannot control that demand. A significant reduction in leasing demand for our communications infrastructure would materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. Factors that may affect such demand include: • increased mergers, consolidations or exits that reduce the number of wireless service providers or increased use of network sharing among governments or wireless service providers; • the financial condition of wireless service providers, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic; • zoning, environmental, health, tax or other government regulations or changes in the application and enforcement thereof; • governmental licensing of spectrum or restriction or revocation of our tenants’ spectrum licenses; • a decrease in consumer demand for wireless services, including due to general economic conditions, disruption in the financial and credit markets or global social, political or health crises, such as the material adverse effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and markets; • the ability and willingness of wireless service providers to maintain or increase capital expenditures on network infrastructure; • delays or changes in the deployment of next generation wireless technologies; and • technological changes. If our tenants consolidate their operations, exit the telecommunications business or share site infrastructure to a significant degree, our growth, revenue and ability to generate positive cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Significant consolidation among our tenants could reduce demand for our communications infrastructure and may materially and adversely affect our growth and revenues. Certain combined companies have rationalized duplicative parts of their networks or modernized their networks, and these and other tenants could determine not to renew, or attempt to cancel, avoid or limit leases or related payments with us. In the event a tenant terminates its business or separately sells its spectrum, we may experience increased churn as a result. Our ongoing contractual revenues and our future results may be negatively impacted if a significant number of these leases are terminated or not renewed. For example, see our discussion of carrier consolidation-driven churn in our Asia-Pacific property segment and our expected churn in our U.S. & Canada property segment, as a result of the T-Mobile MLA, in Item 7 of this Annual Report, under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Executive Overview.” In addition, extensive sharing of site infrastructure, roaming or resale arrangements among wireless service providers, including due to increases in advanced network technology such as 5G, as an alternative to leasing our communications sites, without compensation to us, may cause new lease activity to slow if carriers utilize shared equipment rather than deploy new equipment, or may result in the decommissioning of equipment on certain existing sites because portions of the tenants’ networks may become redundant. A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of tenants, and we are sensitive to adverse changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our tenants. A substantial portion of our total operating revenues is derived from a small number of tenants. If any of these tenants are unwilling or unable to perform their obligations under their agreements with us, our revenues, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected. One or more of our tenants, or their parent companies, may experience financial difficulties, file for bankruptcy or reduce or terminate operations as a result of a prolonged economic downturn, economic difficulties (including those from the imposition 9 Table of Contents of taxes, fees, regulations or judicial interpretations of regulations, and any associated penalties or interest, which may be substantial) or otherwise. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could materially and adversely affect our tenants through disruptions of, among other things, their ability to procure telecommunications equipment through their supply chains and their ability to maintain liquidity and deploy network capital, with potential decreases in consumer spending contributing to liquidity risks. Such financial difficulties could result in uncollectible accounts receivable and an impairment of our deferred rent asset, tower asset, network location intangible asset, tenant-related intangible asset or goodwill. The loss of significant tenants, or the loss of all or a portion of our anticipated lease revenues from certain tenants, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Due to the long-term nature of our tenant leases, we depend on the continued financial strength of our tenants. Many wireless service providers operate with substantial levels of debt. In our international operations, many of our tenants are subsidiaries of global telecommunications companies. These subsidiaries may not have the explicit or implied financial support of their parent entities. In addition, many of our tenants and potential tenants rely on capital raising activities to fund their operations and capital expenditures, which may be more difficult or expensive in the event of downturns in the economy or disruptions in the financial and credit markets, such as the current environment driven by the significant disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. If our tenants or potential tenants are unable to raise adequate capital to fund their business plans or face capital constraints, they may reduce their spending, file for bankruptcy or reduce or terminate operations, which could materially and adversely affect demand for our communications sites and our services business. In the ordinary course of our business, we do occasionally experience disputes with our tenants, generally regarding the interpretation of terms in our leases. Historically, we have resolved these disputes in a manner that did not have a material adverse effect on us or our relationships with our tenants. However, it is possible that such disputes could lead to a termination of our leases with those tenants, a material adverse modification of the terms of those leases or a deterioration in our relationships with those tenants that leads to a failure to obtain new business from them, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. If we are forced to resolve any of these disputes through litigation, our relationship with the applicable tenant could be terminated or damaged, which could lead to decreased revenue or increased costs, resulting in a corresponding adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Increasing competition within our industry may materially and adversely affect our revenue. Our industry is highly competitive and our tenants have numerous alternatives in leasing antenna space. Competition due to pricing or alternative contractual arrangements from peers could materially and adversely affect our lease rates. We may not be able to renew existing tenant leases or enter into new tenant leases, or if we are able to renew or enter into new leases, they may be at rates lower than our current rates or on less favorable terms than our current terms, resulting in an adverse impact on our results of operations and growth rate. In addition, should inflation rates exceed our fixed escalator percentages in markets where our leases include fixed escalators, our returns could be adversely affected. Our expansion initiatives involve a number of risks and uncertainties, including those related to integrating acquired or leased assets, that could adversely affect our operating results, disrupt our operations or expose us to additional risk. As we continue to acquire and build communications sites and other communications infrastructure assets in our existing markets and expand into new markets, we are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including not meeting our return on investment criteria and financial objectives, increased costs, assumed liabilities and the diversion of managerial attention. Achieving the benefits of acquisition and platform expansion initiatives depends in part on timely and efficient integration of operations, telecommunications infrastructure assets and personnel. Integration may be difficult and unpredictable for many reasons, including, among other things, portfolios without requisite permits, differing systems, cultural differences, conflicting policies, procedures and operations. Additionally, temporary business closures, social distancing measures and the potential unavailability of key personnel or a significant number of our employees as a result of COVID-19 are difficult to predict, and may have a negative impact on the timely and efficient integration of operations, telecommunications infrastructure assets and personnel. Significant acquisition-related integration costs, including certain nonrecurring charges such as costs associated with onboarding employees, integrating information technology systems, acquiring permits and visiting, inspecting, engineering and upgrading tower sites or related communications infrastructure assets, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in the period in which such charges are recorded or our cash flow in the period in which any related costs are actually paid. Some of our acquired tower portfolios have included sites that do not meet our structural specifications, including sites that may be overburdened. In these cases, in addition to additional capital expenditures, general liability risks associated with such towers will exist until such time as those towers are upgraded or otherwise remedied. In addition, integration may 10 Table of Contents significantly burden management and internal resources, including through the potential loss or unavailability of key personnel. If we fail to successfully integrate the assets we acquire or fail to utilize such assets to their full capacity, we may not realize the benefits we expect from our acquired portfolios, and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. Our international expansion initiatives are subject to additional risks, such as those described above, as well as our ability to comply with bribery and anti-corruption laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) and similar local laws. Additionally, failure to successfully and efficiently integrate acquired assets from the Pending Telxius Acquisition (the “Telxius Assets”) into our operations may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Integrating acquired portfolios of the Telxius Assets may require significant resources, including increased attention from our management team. Further, the significant acquisition-related integration costs could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in the periods in which such charges are recorded or our cash flow in the periods in which any related costs are actually paid. The integration of the Telxius Assets, which includes approximately 31,000 international communications sites, into our operations will be a significant undertaking, and we anticipate that we will incur certain nonrecurring charges as a result. Additional integration challenges include: • transitioning all data related to the Telxius Assets, tenants and landlords to a common information technology system; • successfully marketing space on the Telxius Assets; • successfully transitioning the lease rent payment and the tenant billing and collection processes; • retaining existing tenants on the Telxius Assets; and • maintaining our standards, controls, procedures and policies with respect to the Telxius Assets. Additionally, we may fail to successfully integrate the assets we acquire or fail to utilize such assets to their full capacity. If we are not able to meet these integration challenges, we may not realize the benefits we expect from our acquired portfolios and businesses, including the Pending Telxius Acquisition, and our business, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected. As a result of our acquisitions, we have a substantial amount of intangible assets and goodwill. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”), we are required to assess our goodwill and other intangible assets annually or more frequently in the event of circumstances indicating potential impairment to determine if they are impaired. If, as a result of the factors noted above, the testing performed indicates that an asset may not be recoverable or the carrying value exceeds the fair value, we would be required to record a non-cash impairment charge in the period the determination is made. Our platform expansion initiatives may not be successful, or we may be required to record impairment charges for our goodwill or for other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition, and could limit our continued investments in such platform expansion initiatives. New technologies or changes in our or a tenant’s business model could make our tower leasing business less desirable and result in decreasing revenues and operating results. The development and implementation of new technologies designed to enhance the efficiency of wireless networks or changes in a tenant’s business model could reduce the need for tower-based wireless services, decrease demand for tower space or reduce previously obtainable lease rates. In addition, if the industry trends toward deploying increased capital to the development and implementation of new technologies, then tenants may allocate less of their budgets to leasing space on our towers. Examples of these technologies include more spectrally efficient technologies, which could relieve a portion of our tenants’ network capacity needs and, as a result, could reduce the demand for tower-based antenna space. Additionally, certain small cell complementary network technologies or satellite services could shift a portion of our tenants’ network investments away from traditional tower-based networks, which may reduce the need for carriers to add more equipment at certain communications sites. Moreover, the emergence of alternative technologies could reduce the need for tower-based broadcast services transmission and reception. Further, a tenant may decide to cease outsourcing tower infrastructure or otherwise change its business model, which would result in a decrease in our revenue and operating results. Our failure to innovate in response to the development and implementation of these or other new technologies or changes in a tenant’s business model could have a material adverse effect on the growth of our business, results of operations or financial condition. Conversely, we may invest significant capital in technologies, platform expansion initiatives or new additions to our core business that may not provide expected returns or profitability, which could divert management attention and have a material adverse effect on our operating results. 11 Table of Contents Competition for assets could adversely affect our ability to achieve our return on investment criteria. We may experience increased competition for the acquisition of assets or contracts to build new communications sites for tenants, which could make the acquisition of high-quality assets significantly more costly or prohibitive or cause us to lose contracts to build new sites. Some of our competitors are larger and may have greater financial resources than we do, while other competitors may apply less stringent investment criteria than we do. In addition, we may not anticipate increased competition entering a particular market or competing for the same assets. Higher prices for assets or the failure to add new assets to our portfolio could make it more difficult to achieve our anticipated returns on investment or future growth, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. Risks Related to Our Financial Performance or General Economic Conditions Our leverage and debt service obligations may materially and adversely affect our ability to raise additional financing to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives and to satisfy our distribution requirements. Our leverage and debt service obligations, including as a result of our recent InSite Acquisition and the Pending Telxius Acquisition, could have significant negative consequences to our business, results of operations or financial condition, including: • requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our debt, thereby reducing the amount of our cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures and REIT distributions; • impairing our ability to meet one or more of the financial ratio covenants contained in our debt agreements or to generate cash sufficient to pay interest or principal due under those agreements, which could result in an acceleration of some or all of our outstanding debt and the loss of the towers securing such debt if a default remains uncured; • limiting our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing, thereby placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitors and competitors that may have better access to capital resources, including with respect to acquiring assets; and • limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the markets in which we compete. We may need to raise additional capital through debt financing activities, asset sales or equity issuances, even if the then-prevailing market conditions are not favorable, to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, required purchases of our joint venture partners’ interests and to satisfy our distribution requirements and debt service obligations and leverage requirements, including financial ratio covenants. An increase in our total leverage could lead to a downgrade of our credit rating below investment grade, which could negatively impact our ability to access credit markets or preclude us from obtaining funds on investment grade terms, rates and conditions or subject us to additional loan covenants, which could accelerate our debt repayment obligations. Further, certain of our current debt instruments limit the amount of indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may incur. Additional financing, therefore, may be unavailable, more expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness. Further, extreme market volatility and disruption caused by COVID-19 may impact our ability to raise additional capital through debt and equity financing activities or our ability to repay or refinance maturing liabilities, or impact the terms of any new obligations, which in turn may have an adverse impact on our credit ratings. The extent to which COVID-19 will impact our business and financial results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time due to the rapid evolution of this uncertain situation. Restrictive covenants in the agreements related to our securitization transactions, our credit facilities and our debt securities could materially and adversely affect our business by limiting flexibility, and we may be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock, which may jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a REIT. The agreements related to our securitization transactions include operating covenants and other restrictions customary for loans subject to rated securitizations. Among other things, the borrowers under the agreements are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets. A failure to comply with the covenants in the agreements could prevent the borrowers from taking certain actions with respect to the secured assets and could prevent the borrowers from distributing any excess cash from the operation of such assets to us. If the borrowers were to default on any of the loans, the servicer on such loan could seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of the secured assets, in which case we could lose such assets and the cash flow associated with such assets. The agreements for our credit facilities also contain restrictive covenants and leverage and other financial maintenance tests that could limit our ability to take various actions, including incurring additional debt, guaranteeing indebtedness or making distributions to stockholders, including our required REIT distributions, and engaging in various types of transactions, including 12 Table of Contents mergers, acquisitions and sales of assets. Additionally, our credit facilities restrict our and our subsidiaries’ ability to incur liens securing our or their indebtedness. These covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, new tower development, mergers and acquisitions or other opportunities. Our credit agreements also contain cross-default and/or cross-acceleration provisions, which may be triggered if we default on certain indebtedness in excess of certain thresholds. In the event of such a default, the resulting cross-defaults or cross-accelerations could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Further, reporting and information covenants in our credit agreements and indentures require that we provide financial and operating information within certain time periods. If we are unable to provide the required information on a timely basis, we would be in breach of these covenants. For more information regarding the covenants and requirements discussed above, please see Item 7 of this Annual Report under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Factors Affecting Sources of Liquidity” and note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. We also enter into hedges for certain debt instruments, which may have an adverse impact on our results to the extent that the counterparties do not perform as expected at the inception of each hedge. We may be adversely affected by changes in LIBOR reporting practices, the method in which LIBOR is determined or the use of alternative reference rates. In July 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”), which regulates the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), announced plans to phase out LIBOR rates by the end of 2021. As contemplated, the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot be assured after 2021, and LIBOR may cease to exist or otherwise be unsuitable for benchmarking. While our bank facilities contain fallback provisions to establish an alternative rate in the event LIBOR is unavailable, the elimination of LIBOR could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Financial institutions may replace LIBOR with a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate; however, no consensus exists as to what may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, whether LIBOR rates will cease to be published or supported before or after 2021 or whether any additional reforms to LIBOR may be enacted in the United Kingdom or elsewhere. Furthermore, the use of an alternative rate could result in increased costs, including increased interest expense, and increased borrowing and hedging costs in the future. We cannot predict the effect of the FCA’s decision not to sustain LIBOR or, if changes ultimately are made to LIBOR, the effect those changes may have on our interest expense related to borrowings under our bank facilities, certain other debt service obligations and interest swap agreements, which could potentially negatively impact our financial condition. Risks Related to Laws and Regulations Our business, and that of our tenants, is subject to laws, regulations and administrative and judicial decisions, and changes thereto, that could restrict our ability to operate our business as we currently do or impact our competitive landscape. Our business, and that of our tenants, is subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws, treaties and regulations and administrative and judicial decisions. In certain jurisdictions, these regulations, laws and treaties could be applied or be enforced retroactively. Zoning authorities and community organizations are sometimes opposed to the construction of communications sites in their communities, which can delay, prevent or increase the cost of new tower construction, modifications, additions of new antennas to a site or site upgrades, thereby limiting our ability to respond to tenant demands. Existing or new regulatory policies, regulations or laws may materially and adversely affect the timing, cost or completion of our communications sites or result in changes in the competitive landscape that may negatively affect our business. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to litigants or result in decreased revenue. In addition, in certain jurisdictions, we and certain of our tenants are required to pay annual license fees, which may be subject to substantial increases by the government, or new fees may be enacted and applied retroactively. Governmental licenses may also be subject to periodic renewal and additional conditions to receive or maintain such license. In addition, federal, state and local governments in many of our markets have recently taken actions to contain the spread of COVID-19, including travel bans, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and business shutdowns, among others, and may take additional actions in the future. In response to governmental actions, we have taken a variety of measures, including providing support for our tenants remotely, requiring work-from-home arrangements and restricting travel for our employees where practicable and other modifications to our business practices. These governmental actions could remain effective for a prolonged period of time with potential material adverse impacts on our, and our tenants’, business operations. Moreover, while the restrictions and limitations noted above may be relaxed or rolled back if and when COVID-19 abates or vaccinations become more prevalent, such government actions may be reinstated as the pandemic continues to evolve and in response to actual or potential resurgences. The scope and timing of any such reinstatement is difficult to predict and may materially and adversely affect our operations in the future. 13 Table of Contents Furthermore, the tax laws, regulations, applicable license terms and conditions, and interpretations governing our business, and that of our tenants, in jurisdictions where we operate, may change at any time, potentially with retroactive effect. This includes changes in tax laws, spectrum use terms, administrative compliance guidance or judicial interpretations thereof. For example, the October 2019 ruling of the Supreme Court of India regarding the definition of adjusted gross revenue (“AGR”) and associated fees and charges may have a material financial impact on certain of our tenants which could affect their ability to perform their obligations under agreements with us. Changes in laws, regulations and judicial decisions could have a more significant impact on us as a REIT relative to other REITs due to the nature of our business and our use of taxable REIT subsidiaries. These factors could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. Our foreign operations are subject to economic, political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position, including risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Our international business operations and our potential expansion into additional new markets in the future expose us to potential adverse financial and operational problems not typically experienced in the United States. We anticipate that revenues from our international operations will continue to grow. Accordingly, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally, including: • uncertain, inconsistent or changing laws, regulations, rulings or methodologies impacting our existing and anticipated international operations, fees or other requirements directed specifically at the ownership and operation of communications sites or our international acquisitions, any of which laws, fees or requirements may be applied retroactively or with significant delay; • failure to retain our tax status or to obtain an expected tax status for which we have applied; • expropriation resulting in government takeover of tenant operations or governmental regulation restricting foreign ownership or requiring reversion or divestiture; • laws or regulations that tax or otherwise restrict repatriation of earnings or other funds or otherwise limit distributions of capital; • changes in a specific country’s or region’s political or economic conditions, including inflation or currency devaluation; • changes to zoning regulations or construction laws, which could be applied retroactively to our existing communications sites; • actions restricting or revoking our tenants’ spectrum licenses, or alterations or interpretations thereof, or suspending or terminating business under prior licenses; • failure to comply with anti-bribery laws such as the FCPA or similar local anti-bribery laws, or the Office of Foreign Assets Control requirements; • failure to comply with data privacy laws or other protections of employee health and personal information; • material site issues related to security, fuel availability and reliability of electrical grids; • significant increases in, or implementation of new, license surcharges on our revenue; • loss of key personnel, including expatriates, in markets where talent is difficult or expensive to acquire; and • price-setting or other similar laws or regulations for the sharing of passive infrastructure. We also face risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, including those arising from the impacts of COVID-19 on the global economy and markets and those arising from our operations, investments and financing transactions related to our international business. Volatility in foreign currency exchange rates, which has recently increased as a result of uncertainties caused by COVID-19, can also affect our ability to plan, forecast and budget for our international operations and expansion efforts. Our revenues earned from our international operations are primarily denominated in their respective local currencies. We have not historically engaged in significant currency hedging activities relating to our non-U.S. Dollar operations, and a weakening of these foreign currencies against the U.S. Dollar would negatively impact our reported revenues, operating profits and income. In addition, as we continue to invest in joint venture opportunities internationally, our partners may have business or economic goals that are inconsistent or conflict with ours, be in positions to take action contrary to our interests, policies or objectives, have competing interests in our, or other, markets that could create conflict of interest issues, withhold consents contrary to our requests or become unable or unwilling to fulfill their commitments, any of which could present governance challenges with multiple joint venture partners or expose us to additional liabilities or costs, including requiring us to assume and fulfill the obligations of that joint venture or to execute buyouts of their interests. If we fail to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT, we will be subject to tax at corporate income tax rates, which may substantially reduce funds otherwise available, and even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may face tax liabilities that impact earnings and available cash flow. 14 Table of Contents Commencing with the taxable year beginning January 1, 2012, we have operated as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. Qualification for taxation as a REIT requires the application of certain highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), which provisions may change from time to time, to our operations as well as various factual determinations concerning matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. Further, tax legislation may adversely affect our ability to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT or the benefits or desirability of remaining so qualified. There are few judicial or administrative interpretations of the relevant provisions of the Code. If, in any taxable year, we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT and are not entitled to relief under the Code: • we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders and would be subject to federal and state income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates, which could be substantial in amount, and may require us to borrow additional funds or liquidate some investments to pay any additional tax liability and, accordingly, may reduce funds available for other purposes; and • we will be disqualified from REIT tax treatment for the four taxable years immediately following the year during which we were so disqualified. We are subject to certain federal, state, local and foreign taxes on our income and assets, including taxes on any undistributed income and state, local or foreign income, franchise, property and transfer taxes. While state and local income tax regimes often parallel the U.S. federal income tax regime for REITs, many of these jurisdictions differ in their treatment of REITs. For example, some state and local jurisdictions currently or in the future may limit or eliminate a REIT’s deduction for dividends paid, which could increase our income tax expense. We are also subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and state, local and foreign tax authorities. The results of an audit and examination of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures may have an adverse effect on our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability. Furthermore, we have owned and may from time to time own direct and indirect ownership interests in subsidiary REITs, which must also comply with the same REIT requirements that we must satisfy, together with all other rules applicable to REITs. If the subsidiary REIT is determined to have failed to qualify for taxation as a REIT and certain relief provisions do not apply, then the subsidiary REIT would be subject to federal income tax, which tax we would economically bear along with applicable penalties and interest. In addition, our ownership of shares in such subsidiary REIT would fail to be a qualifying asset for purposes of the asset tests applicable to REITs and any dividend income or gains derived by us from such subsidiary REIT may cease to be treated as income that qualifies for purposes of the 75% gross income test. These consequences could have a material adverse effect on our ability to comply with the REIT income and asset tests, and thus our ability to qualify for taxation as a REIT. Complying with REIT requirements may limit our flexibility or cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities. Our use of TRSs enables us to engage in non-REIT qualifying business activities. Under the Code, no more than 20% of the value of the assets of a REIT may be represented by securities of one or more TRSs and no more than 25% of the value of the assets of the REIT may be represented by non-qualifying assets (including securities of one or more TRSs). This limitation may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments or take advantage of acquisition opportunities, including the purchase of non-qualifying assets, the expansion of non-real estate activities and investments in the businesses to be conducted by our TRSs, and to that extent limit our opportunities and our flexibility to change our business strategy. Further, as a REIT, we must distribute to our stockholders an amount equal to at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain). To meet our annual distribution requirements, we may be required to distribute amounts that may otherwise be used for our operations, including amounts that may otherwise be invested in future acquisitions, capital expenditures or repayment of debt. As no more than 25% of our gross income may consist of dividend income from our TRSs and other non-qualifying types of income, our ability to receive distributions from our TRSs may be limited, which may impact our ability to fund distributions to our stockholders or to use income of our TRSs to fund other investments. In addition, the majority of our income and cash flows from our TRSs are generated from our international operations. In many cases, there are local withholding taxes and currency controls that may impact our ability or willingness to repatriate funds to the United States to help satisfy REIT distribution requirements. We could have liability under environmental and occupational safety and health laws. 15 Table of Contents Our operations are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations, including those relating to the management, use, storage, disposal, emission and remediation of, and exposure to, hazardous and non-hazardous substances, materials and wastes. As the owner, lessee or operator of real property and facilities, including generators, we may be liable for substantial costs of investigation, removal or remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous materials, and for damages and costs relating to off-site migration of hazardous materials, without regard to whether we, as the owner, lessee or operator, knew of, or were responsible for, the contamination. We may also be liable for certain costs of remediating contamination at third-party sites to which we sent waste for disposal, even if the original disposal may have complied with all legal requirements at the time. Many of these laws and regulations contain information reporting and record keeping requirements. We may not be at all times in compliance with all environmental requirements. We may be subject to potentially significant fines or penalties if we fail to comply with any of these requirements. The requirements of the environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and could become more stringent in the future. In certain jurisdictions, these laws and regulations could be applied retroactively or be broadened to cover situations or persons not currently considered. It is possible that these requirements will change or that liabilities will arise in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. While we maintain environmental and workers’ compensation insurance, we may not have adequate insurance to cover all costs, fines or penalties. Risks Related to the Operation of Our Business Our towers, fiber networks, data centers or computer systems may be affected by natural disasters, security breaches and other unforeseen events for which our insurance may not provide adequate coverage. Our towers, fiber networks, data centers and computer systems are subject to risks associated with natural disasters, such as hurricanes, ice and wind storms, tornadoes, floods, earthquakes and wildfires, as well as other unforeseen events, such as the potential adverse effects of COVID-19 or other pandemics and acts of terrorism. During the past several years, we have seen an increase in severe weather events and expect this trend to continue due to climate change. Climate change or efforts to regulate emissions may also have direct or indirect effects on our business by increasing the cost of emission compliance or fuel we need to deliver primary power to our tenants under our contractual obligations, typically through diesel-powered generators, in emerging markets. Further, any damage or destruction to, or inability to access, our towers, fiber networks, data centers or computer systems, as a result of measures implemented in response to COVID-19 or otherwise, may cause supply chain delays or impact our ability to provide services to our tenants and lead to tenant loss, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Additionally, our communications sites could be subject to attacks instigated by claims that the deployment of 5G networks is linked to adverse health effects. As part of our normal business activities and in our platform expansion initiatives or managed networks businesses, we rely on information technology and other computing resources. Our computer systems, network operation centers or power systems, or those of our cloud or Internet-based providers, could fail on their own accord and are subject to interruption or damage from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches (including through cyber-attack, data theft and exploiting potentially vulnerable services, such as virtual private networks and communication and collaboration platforms as a result of increased teleworking activity as a result of COVID-19), usage errors, catastrophic events such as natural disasters and other events beyond our control. Although we and our vendors have disaster recovery programs and security measures in place, if our computer systems and our backup systems are compromised, degraded, damaged, breached or otherwise cease to function properly, we could suffer interruptions in our operations, including our ability to correctly record, process and report financial information, our tenants’ network availability may be impacted or we could unintentionally allow misappropriation of proprietary or confidential information (including information about our tenants or landlords, or tenant information on our platform expansion initiatives or managed networks businesses), which could result in a loss of revenue, damage to our reputation, damage to our tenant and vendor relationships, litigation, regulatory investigations and penalties under existing or future data privacy laws and require us to incur significant costs to remediate or otherwise resolve these issues. In addition, our recent acquisitions, including acquisitions of fiber businesses, may increase our exposure to the risks described above and have material and adverse effects on our business. While we maintain insurance coverage for natural disasters, business interruption and cybersecurity, we may not have adequate insurance to cover the associated costs of repair or reconstruction of sites or fiber for a major future event, lost revenue, including from new tenants that could have been added to our towers, fiber networks or data centers but for the event, or other costs to remediate the impact of a significant event. Further, we may be liable for damage caused by towers that collapse for any number of reasons including structural deficiencies, which could harm our reputation and require us to incur costs for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage. 16 Table of Contents Our costs could increase and our revenues could decrease due to perceived health risks from radio emissions, especially if these perceived risks are substantiated. Public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and other wireless communications technology could slow the growth of wireless companies, which could in turn slow our growth. In particular, negative public perception of, and regulations regarding, these perceived health risks, including claims that the deployment of 5G networks is linked to adverse health effects, could undermine the market acceptance of wireless communications services and increase opposition to the development and expansion of tower sites. If a scientific study, court decision or government agency ruling resulted in a finding that radio frequency emissions pose health risks to consumers, it could negatively impact our tenants and the market for wireless services, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. We do not maintain any significant insurance with respect to these matters. If we are unable to protect our rights to the land under our towers, it could adversely affect our business and operating results. Our real property interests relating to our towers consist primarily of leasehold and sub-leasehold interests, fee interests, easements, licenses and rights-of-way. A loss of these interests at a particular tower site may interfere with our ability to operate that tower site and generate revenues. For various reasons, we may not always have the ability to access, analyze and verify all information regarding titles and other issues prior to completing an acquisition of communications sites, which can affect our rights to access and operate a site. From time to time, we also experience disputes with landowners regarding the terms of easements or ground agreements for land under towers, which can affect our ability to access and operate tower sites. Further, for various reasons, landowners may not want to renew their ground agreements with us, they may lose their rights to the land, or they may transfer their land interests to third parties, including ground lease aggregators, which could affect our ability to renew ground agreements on commercially viable terms. A significant number of the communications sites in our portfolio are located on land we lease pursuant to long-term operating leases. Further, for various reasons, title to property interests in some of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate may not be as certain as title to our property interests in the United States. Our inability to protect our rights to the land under our towers may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. If we are unable or choose not to exercise our rights to purchase towers that are subject to lease and sublease agreements at the end of the applicable period, our cash flows derived from those towers will be eliminated. Our communications real estate portfolio includes towers that we operate pursuant to lease and sublease agreements that include a purchase option at the end of the lease period. We may not have the required available capital to exercise our right to purchase the towers at the end of the applicable period, or we may choose, for business or other reasons, not to do so. If we do not exercise these purchase rights, and are unable to extend the lease or sublease or otherwise acquire an interest that would allow us to continue to operate these towers after the applicable period, we will lose the cash flows derived from the towers. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES As of December 31, 2020, we owned and operated a portfolio of 185,641 communications sites, including 1,781 DAS networks. See the table in Item 7 of this Annual Report, under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Executive Overview” for more detailed information on the geographic locations of our communications sites. In addition, we own property interests that we lease to communications service providers and third-party tower operators in Canada and the United States, which are included in our U.S. & Canada property segment, and in Australia, which are included in our Asia-Pacific property segment. Our interests in our communications sites consist of a variety of ownership interests, including leases created by long-term ground lease agreements, easements, licenses or rights-of-way granted by government entities. A typical tower site consists of a compound enclosing the tower site, a tower structure and, in some cases, one or more equipment shelters that house a variety of transmitting, receiving and switching equipment. In addition, many of our international sites typically include power generators and batteries, which are often used for primary power in lieu of an electric 17 Table of Contents grid connection in select markets. The principal types of our towers are guyed, self-supporting lattice and monopole, and rooftop towers in our international markets. • A guyed tower includes a series of cables attaching separate levels of the tower to anchor foundations in the ground and can reach heights of up to 2,000 feet. A typical guyed broadcast tower can be located a tract of land of up to 20 acres. • A self-supporting lattice tower typically tapers from the bottom up and usually has three or four legs. A lattice tower can reach heights of up to 1,000 feet, although most lattice structures are between 200 and 400 feet. Depending on the height of the tower, a lattice tower site can be located on a tract of land of 10,000 square feet for a rural site or fewer than 2,500 square feet for a metropolitan site. • A monopole tower is a tubular structure that is used primarily to address space constraints or aesthetic concerns. Monopoles typically have heights ranging from 50 to 200 feet. A monopole tower site used in metropolitan areas for a typical wireless communications tower can be located on a tract of land of fewer than 2,500 square feet. • Rooftop towers are primarily used in metropolitan areas in our Asia-Pacific, Africa, Europe and Latin America markets, where locations for traditional tower structures are unavailable. Rooftop towers typically have heights ranging from 10 to 100 feet. U.S. & Canada Property Segment Encumbered Sites . As of December 31, 2020, the loan underlying the securitization transactions completed in March 2013 and March 2018 (the “2013 Securitization” and the “2018 Securitization”, respectively, and together, the “Trust Securitizations”) is secured by mortgages, deeds of trust and deeds to secure the loan on substantially all of the 5,114 broadcast and wireless communications towers and related assets owned by the borrowers (the “Trust Sites”) and the secured revenue notes issued in a private transaction completed in May 2015 (the “2015 Securitization”) are secured by mortgages, deeds of trust and deeds to secure debt on substantially all of the 3,538 communications sites owned by subsidiaries of the issuer (the “2015 Secured Sites”). We acquired certain debt in connection with the InSite Acquisition (the “InSite Debt”). As of December 31, 2020, the InSite Debt was secured by an aggregate of 1,946 sites. Subsequent to December 31, 2020, we repaid the entire amount outstanding under the InSite Debt (see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report). Asia-Pacific Property Segment Encumbered Sites. There are no encumbered sites in our Asia-Pacific property segment. Africa Property Segment Encumbered Sites. There are no encumbered sites in our Africa property segment. Europe Property Segment Encumbered Sites. There are no encumbered sites in our Europe property segment. Latin America Property Segment Encumbered Sites . Our outstanding indebtedness in Colombia is secured by an aggregate of 3,563 towers. Ground Leases. Of the 183,860 towers in our portfolio as of December 31, 2020, approximately 90% were located on land we lease. Typically, we seek to enter long-term ground leases, which have initial terms of approximately five to ten years with one or more automatic or exercisable renewal periods. As a result, 43% of the ground leases for our sites have a final expiration date of 2030 and beyond. Tenants . Our tenants are primarily wireless service providers, broadcasters and other companies in a variety of industries. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our top three tenants by total revenue were AT&T (22%), T-Mobile (19%) and Verizon Wireless (14%). Across most of our markets, our tenant leases generally have initial non-cancellable terms of five to ten years with multiple renewal terms. As a result, approximately 64% of our current tenant leases have a renewal date of 2026 or beyond. Offices. Our principal corporate headquarters is leased and located in Boston, Massachusetts, where we currently lease approximately 40,000 square feet of office space. We also own or have entered into long-term leases for the majority of our facilities in international and regional locations for the management and operation of our property and services businesses, including offices in each of our U.S. & Canada, Asia-Pacific, Africa, Europe and Latin America segments. We believe that our owned and leased facilities are suitable and adequate to meet our anticipated needs. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS We periodically become involved in various claims and lawsuits that are incidental to our business. In the opinion of management, after consultation with counsel, there are no matters currently pending that would, in the event of an adverse outcome, have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity. 18 Table of Contents ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES N/A. 19 Table of Contents PART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Our common stock is listed on the NYSE under the ticker symbol AMT. As of February 18, 2021, we had 444,384,437 outstanding shares of common stock and 147 registered holders. Dividends As a REIT, we must annually distribute to our stockholders an amount equal to at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain). Generally, we have distributed and expect to continue to distribute all or substantially all of our REIT taxable income after taking into consideration our utilization of net operating losses ( “ NOLs ” ). The amount, timing and frequency of future distributions will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon various factors, a number of which may be beyond our control, including our financial condition and operating cash flows, the amount required to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT and reduce any income and excise taxes that we otherwise would be required to pay, limitations on distributions in our existing and future debt and preferred equity instruments, our ability to utilize NOLs to offset our distribution requirements, limitations on our ability to fund distributions using cash generated through our TRSs and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant.

SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA N/A. ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations that follow are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences could be material to the financial statements. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report and the accompanying notes, and the information set forth under the caption “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” below. During the fourth quarter of 2020, as a result of the InSite Acquisition, we updated our reportable segments to rename U.S. property and Asia property to U.S. & Canada property and Asia-Pacific property, respectively. We continue to report our results in six segments – U.S. & Canada property, Asia-Pacific property, Africa property, Europe property, Latin America property and 21 Table of Contents services. This change was made to better align the names of our reportable segments with the geographical areas of our business operations following the InSite Acquisition. The change of our reportable segments names is solely reflective of the inclusion of Canada and Australia in our business operations, as a result of the InSite Acquisition, and had no impact on our consolidated financial statements for any prior periods. Historical financial information included in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations has not been adjusted. In evaluating financial performance in each business segment, management uses, among other factors, segment gross margin and segment operating profit (see note 21 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report). Executive Overview We are one of the largest global REITs and a leading independent owner, operator and developer of multitenant communications real estate. Our primary business is the leasing of space on communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, wireless data providers, government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries. In addition to the communications sites in our portfolio, we manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements. We also hold other telecommunications infrastructure, fiber and property interests that we lease primarily to communications service providers and third-party tower operators. We refer to the business encompassing the above as our property operations, which accounted for 99% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 and includes our U.S. & Canada property, Asia-Pacific property, Africa property, Europe property and Latin America property segments. We also offer tower-related services in the United States, including site application, zoning and permitting and structural analysis, which primarily support our site leasing business, including the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites. 22 Table of Contents The following table details the number of communications sites, excluding managed sites, that we owned or operated as of December 31, 2020: Number of Owned Towers Number of Operated Towers (1) Number of Owned DAS Sites U.S. & Canada: Canada (2) 208 — — United States 27,058 15,432 448 U.S. & Canada total 27,266 15,432 448 Asia-Pacific: (2) India 74,732 — 1,040 Asia-Pacific total 74,732 — 1,040 Africa: Burkina Faso 707 — — Ghana 3,298 663 28 Kenya 2,397 — 9 Niger 720 — — Nigeria 5,823 — — South Africa 2,831 — — Uganda 3,375 — 12 Africa total 19,151 663 49 Europe: France 2,769 309 9 Germany 2,217 — — Poland 27 — — Europe total 5,013 309 9 Latin America: Argentina 119 — 10 Brazil 16,792 2,249 104 Chile 3,005 — 23 Colombia 4,992 — 4 Costa Rica 661 — 2 Mexico 9,500 186 92 Paraguay 1,426 — — Peru 1,935 429 — Latin America total 38,430 2,864 235 _______________ (1) Approximately 95% of the operated towers are held pursuant to long-term finance leases, including those subject to purchase options. (2) In December 2020, we launched operations in Canada and Australia through the InSite Acquisition. In Australia, we do not own or operate communications sites but control land under carrier or other third-party communications sites, which provides recurring cash flow through tenant leasing arrangements. In Canada, we also control land under carrier or other third-party communications sites. On January 13, 2021, we signed agreements for the Pending Telxius Acquisition, pursuant to which we expect to acquire approximately 31,000 communications sites in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Germany, Peru and Spain, for approximately 7.7 billion EUR (approximately $9.4 billion at the time of signing) at closing, subject to certain conditions and limited adjustments. The Pending Telxius Acquisition is expected to close in multiple tranches, beginning in the second quarter of 2021, subject to customary closing conditions, including government and regulatory approval. The impact of the Pending Telxius Acquisition on our 2021 results of operations will be dependent on a number of factors, including the timing of any closings. In most of our markets, our tenant leases with wireless carriers generally have initial non-cancellable terms of five to ten years with multiple renewal terms. Accordingly, the vast majority of the revenue generated by our property operations during the year ended December 31, 2020 was recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. Based upon existing tenant leases and foreign currency exchange rates as of December 31, 2020, we expect to generate nearly $59 billion of non-cancellable tenant lease revenue over future periods, before the impact of straight-line lease accounting. Most of our tenant leases have provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease, typically based on an annual fixed escalation (averaging approximately 3% in the United States) or an inflationary index in most of our international markets, or a combination of both. In addition, certain of our tenant leases provide for additional revenue primarily to cover costs, such as ground rent or power and fuel costs. 23 Table of Contents The revenues generated by our property operations may be affected by cancellations of existing tenant leases. As discussed above, most of our tenant leases with wireless carriers and broadcasters are multiyear contracts, which typically are non-cancellable; however, in some instances, a lease may be cancelled upon the payment of a termination fee. Revenue lost from either tenant lease cancellations or the non-renewal of leases or rent renegotiations, which we refer to as churn, has historically not had a material adverse effect on the revenues generated by our consolidated property operations. During the year ended December 31, 2020, churn was approximately 3% of our tenant billings. Beginning in late 2017, we experienced an increase in revenue lost from cancellations or non-renewals primarily due to carrier consolidation-driven churn in India, which compressed our gross margin and operating profit, particularly in our Asia-Pacific property segment, although this impact was partially offset by lower expenses due to reduced tenancy on existing sites and the decommissioning of certain sites. For the year ended December 31, 2020, aggregate carrier consolidation in India did not have a material impact on our consolidated property revenue, gross margin or operating profit, although overall churn rates in India remained elevated relative to historical levels. We anticipate that our churn rate in India will moderate over time and result in reduced impacts on our property revenue, gross margin and operating profit. In the immediate term, we believe that our churn rate may remain elevated as our tenants in India evaluate the recent court rulings by the Indian Supreme Court and determine their payment plans for the AGR fees and charges prescribed by such court, as set forth in Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption “Risk Factors—Our business, and that of our tenants, is subject to laws, regulations and administrative and judicial decisions, and changes thereto, that could restrict our ability to operate our business as we currently do or impact our competitive landscape.” We expect to periodically evaluate the carrying value of our Indian assets, which may result in the realization of additional impairment expense or other similar charges. For more information, please see the information under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.” Additionally, we expect that our churn rate in our U.S. & Canada property segment will be elevated for a period of several years due to contractual lease cancellations and non-renewals by T-Mobile, including legacy Sprint Corporation leases, pursuant to the terms of the T-Mobile MLA signed in September 2020. As further set forth in Item 1A of this Annual Report under the captions “Risk Factors,” the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the response to mitigate its spread and effects, may adversely impact us and our tenants and the demand for our communications sites in the United States and globally. We have taken a variety of actions to ensure the continued availability of our communications sites, while ensuring the safety and security of our employees, tenants, vendors and surrounding communities. These measures include providing support for our tenants remotely, requiring work-from-home arrangements and restricting travel for our employees where practicable and other modifications to our business practices. We will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions as may be required by governmental authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, tenants and business partners. As a result of the impact of COVID-19 on global financial markets, foreign currency exchange rates have been volatile in many of the markets in which we operate. We estimate that the adverse impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates on our consolidated revenue and operating profit in the current period, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, was approximately $315 million and $172 million, respectively. If exchange rates become significantly more unfavorable, the impact to our revenue and other future operating results could be material. Additionally, the impact of COVID-19 on our operational results in subsequent periods will largely depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted at this time. These developments may include, but are not limited to, new information concerning the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, the degree of success of actions taken to contain or treat COVID-19, including the availability and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, and the reactions by consumers, companies, governmental entities and capital markets to such actions. Property Operations Revenue Growth . Due to our diversified communications site portfolio, our tenant lease rates vary considerably depending upon numerous factors, including, but not limited to, amount, type and position of tenant equipment on the tower, remaining tower capacity and tower location. We measure the remaining tower capacity by assessing several factors, including tower height, tower type, environmental conditions, existing equipment on the tower and zoning and permitting regulations in effect in the jurisdiction where the tower is located. In many instances, tower capacity can be increased with relatively modest tower augmentation capital expenditures, which are often reimbursed to us. The primary factors affecting the revenue growth of our property segments are: • Growth in tenant billings, including: • New revenue attributable to leasing additional space on our sites (“colocations”) and lease amendments; • Contractual rent escalations on existing tenant leases, net of churn; and 24 Table of Contents • New revenue attributable to leases in place on day one on sites acquired or constructed since the beginning of the prior-year period. • Revenue growth from other items, including additional tenant payments primarily to cover costs, such as ground rent or power and fuel costs included in certain tenant leases (“pass-through”), straight-line revenue and decommissioning. We continue to believe that our site leasing revenue is likely to increase due to the growing use of wireless services globally and our ability to meet the corresponding incremental demand for our communications real estate. By adding new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our sites, we are able to increase these sites’ utilization and profitability. We believe the majority of our site leasing activity will continue to come from wireless service providers, with tenants in a number of other industries contributing incremental leasing demand. Our site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with new business opportunities, which have historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth as wireless carriers seek to increase the coverage and capacity of their existing networks, while also deploying next generation wireless technologies. In addition, we intend to continue to supplement our organic growth by selectively developing or acquiring new sites in our existing and new markets where we can achieve our risk-adjusted return on investment objectives. Property Operations Organic Revenue Growth . Consistent with our strategy to increase the utilization and return on investment from our sites, our objective is to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants through colocation and lease amendments. Our ability to lease additional space on our sites is primarily a function of the rate at which wireless carriers and other tenants deploy capital to improve and expand their wireless networks. This rate, in turn, is influenced by the growth of wireless services, the penetration of advanced wireless devices, the level of emphasis on network quality and capacity in carrier competition, the financial performance of our tenants and their access to capital and general economic conditions. According to industry data, recent aggregate annual wireless capital spending in the United States has averaged at least $30 billion, resulting in consistent demand for our sites. Based on industry research and projections, we expect that a number of key industry trends will result in incremental revenue opportunities for us: • In less advanced wireless markets where network deployments are in earlier stages, we expect these deployments to drive demand for our tower space as carriers seek to expand their footprints and increase the scope and density of their networks. We have established operations in many of these markets at the early stages of wireless development, which we believe will enable us to meaningfully participate in these deployments over the long term. • Subscribers’ use of mobile data continues to grow rapidly given increasing smartphone and other advanced device penetration, the proliferation of bandwidth-intensive applications on these devices and the continuing evolution of the mobile ecosystem. We believe carriers will be compelled to deploy additional equipment on existing networks while also rolling out more advanced wireless networks to address coverage and capacity needs resulting from this increasing mobile data usage. • The deployment of advanced mobile technology, such as 4G and 5G, will provide higher speed data services and further enable fixed broadband substitution. As a result, we expect that our tenants will continue deploying additional equipment across their existing networks. • Wireless service providers compete based on the quality of their networks, which is driven by capacity and coverage. To maintain or improve their network performance as overall network usage increases, our tenants continue to deploy additional equipment across their existing sites while also adding new cell sites. We anticipate increasing network densification over the next several years, as existing network density is anticipated to be insufficient to account for rapidly increasing levels of wireless data usage. • Wireless service providers continue to acquire additional spectrum, and as a result are expected to add additional sites and equipment to their networks as they seek to optimize their network configuration and utilize additional spectrum. We expect this to be particularly relevant in the context of higher-band spectrum such as 2.5 gigahertz (GHz) and C-Band being deployed for 5G, as these spectrum assets tend to have more limited propagation characteristics compared to the lower-band spectrum that has historically been deployed on our towers. • Next generation technologies requiring wireless connectivity have the potential to provide incremental revenue opportunities for us. These technologies may include edge computing functionality, autonomous vehicle networks and a number of other internet-of-things, or IoT, applications, as well as other potential use cases for wireless services. These technologies may create new and complementary use cases for our communications real estate over time, although these use cases are currently in nascent stages. As part of our international expansion initiatives, we have targeted markets in various stages of network development to diversify our international exposure and position us to benefit from a number of different wireless technology deployments over the long term. For example, as part of our Pending Telxius Acquisition, we expect to increase our exposure to more developed markets in Europe. In addition, we have focused on building relationships with large multinational carriers to increase the opportunities for growth or mutually beneficial transactional opportunities across common markets. We believe that consistent 25 Table of Contents carrier network investments across our international markets will, over the long term, position us to generate meaningful organic revenue growth going forward. In emerging markets, such as Burkina Faso, Ghana, India, Kenya, Niger, Nigeria and Uganda, wireless networks tend to be significantly less advanced than those in the United States, and initial voice networks continue to be deployed in certain underdeveloped areas. A majority of consumers in these markets still utilize basic wireless services and advanced device penetration remains low. In more developed urban locations within these markets, mobile data usage tends to be higher and advanced network deployments are further along. Carriers are focused on completing voice network build-outs while increasing investments in data networks as mobile data usage and smartphone penetration within their customer bases begin to accelerate. In India, the ongoing transition from 2G technology to 4G technology has included a period of carrier consolidation, whereby the number of carriers operating in the marketplace has been reduced through mergers, acquisitions and select carrier exits from the marketplace, which we believe is now substantially complete. We believe that this consolidation process has resulted in an industry structure for both the wireless carriers and communications infrastructure providers that will be more conducive to sustained growth and profitability over time. In markets with rapidly evolving network technology, such as South Africa, Poland and most of the countries in Latin America where we do business, initial voice networks, for the most part, have already been built out, and carriers are increasingly focused on 4G network deployments. Consumers in these regions are increasingly adopting smartphones and other advanced devices, in particular as lower cost smartphones become increasingly available. As a result, the usage of bandwidth-intensive mobile applications is growing materially. Recent spectrum auctions in these rapidly evolving markets have allowed incumbent carriers to accelerate their data network deployments and have also enabled new entrants to begin initial investments in data networks. Smartphone penetration and wireless data usage in these markets are advancing rapidly, which typically requires that carriers continue to invest in their networks to maintain and augment their quality of service. Finally, in markets with more mature network technology, such as Australia, Canada, Germany, France and, following the expected closing of our Pending Telxius Acquisition, Spain, carriers are focused on deploying 4G data networks to account for rapidly increasing wireless data usage among their customer base. With higher smartphone and advanced device penetration and significantly higher per capita data usage, carrier investment in networks is focused on 4G coverage and capacity, as well as the early stages of 5G deployment. We believe that the network technology migration we have seen in the United States, which has led to significantly denser networks and meaningful new business commencements for us over a number of years, will be replicated in our international markets over time. As a result, we expect to be able to leverage our extensive international portfolio of approximately 143,000 communications sites and the relationships we have built with our carrier tenants to drive sustainable, long - term growth. We have master lease agreements with many of our tenants that provide for consistent, long-term revenue and reduce the likelihood of non-contractual churn. Certain of those master lease agreements are comprehensive in nature and further build and augment strong strategic partnerships with our tenants while significantly reducing colocation cycle times, thereby providing our tenants with the ability to rapidly and efficiently deploy equipment on our sites. Demand for our communications sites could be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including an increase in network sharing or consolidation among our tenants, as set forth in Item 1A of this Annual Report under the captions “Risk Factors—If our tenants consolidate their operations, exit the telecommunications business or share site infrastructure to a significant degree, our growth, revenue and ability to generate positive cash flows could be materially and adversely affected” and “Risk Factors—A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of tenants, and we are sensitive to adverse changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our tenants.” In addition, the emergence and growth of new technologies could reduce demand for our sites, as set forth under the caption “Risk Factors—New technologies or changes in our or a tenant’s business model could make our tower leasing business less desirable and result in decreasing revenues and operating results.” Further, our tenants may be subject to new regulatory policies from time to time that materially and adversely affect the demand for our communications sites. Property Operations New Site Revenue Growth. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we grew our portfolio of communications real estate through the acquisition and construction of approximately 9,365 sites globally. In a majority of our Asia-Pacific, Africa, Europe and Latin America markets, the revenue generated from newly acquired or constructed sites resulted in increases in both tenant and pass-through revenues (such as ground rent or power and fuel costs) and expenses. We continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire communications real estate portfolios, both domestically and internationally, to determine whether they meet our risk-adjusted hurdle rates and whether we believe we can effectively integrate them into our existing portfolio. 26 Table of Contents New Sites (Acquired or Constructed) 2020 2019 2018 U.S. & Canada 2,255 430 285 Asia-Pacific 3,960 3,330 21,470 Africa 1,540 6,455 1,040 Europe 610 15 15 Latin America 1,000 3,475 1,655 Property Operations Expenses. Direct operating expenses incurred by our property segments include direct site level expenses and consist primarily of ground rent and power and fuel costs, some or all of which may be passed through to our tenants, as well as property taxes and repairs and maintenance expenses. These segment direct operating expenses exclude all segment and corporate selling, general, administrative and development expenses, which are aggregated into one line item entitled Selling, general, administrative and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations. In general, our property segments’ selling, general, administrative and development expenses do not significantly increase as a result of adding incremental tenants to our sites and typically increase only modestly year-over-year. As a result, leasing additional space to new tenants on our sites provides significant incremental gross margin and cash flow. We may, however, incur additional segment selling, general, administrative and development expenses as we increase our presence in our existing markets or expand into new markets. Our profit margin growth is therefore positively impacted by the addition of new tenants to our sites but can be temporarily diluted by our development activities. Services Segment Revenue Growth . As we continue to focus on growing our property operations, we anticipate that our services revenue will continue to represent a small percentage of our total revenues. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Included in our analysis of our results of operations are discussions regarding earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and accretion, as adjusted (“Adjusted EBITDA”), Funds From Operations, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“Nareit FFO”) attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders, Consolidated Adjusted Funds From Operations (“Consolidated AFFO”) and AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders. We define Adjusted EBITDA as Net income before Income (loss) from equity method investments; Income tax benefit (provision); Other income (expense); Gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations; Interest expense; Interest income; Other operating income (expense); Depreciation, amortization and accretion; and stock-based compensation expense. Nareit FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders is defined as net income before gains or losses from the sale or disposal of real estate, real estate related impairment charges, real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion and dividends on preferred stock, and including adjustments for (i) unconsolidated affiliates and (ii) noncontrolling interests. In this section, we refer to Nareit FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders as “Nareit FFO (common stockholders).” We define Consolidated AFFO as Nareit FFO (common stockholders) before (i) straight-line revenue and expense; (ii) stock-based compensation expense; (iii) the deferred portion of income tax; (iv) non-real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion; (v) amortization of deferred financing costs, capitalized interest, debt discounts and premiums and long-term deferred interest charges; (vi) other income (expense); (vii) gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations; (viii) other operating income (expense); and adjustments for (ix) unconsolidated affiliates and (x) noncontrolling interests, less cash payments related to capital improvements and cash payments related to corporate capital expenditures. We define AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders as Consolidated AFFO, excluding the impact of noncontrolling interests on both Nareit FFO (common stockholders) and the other adjustments included in the calculation of Consolidated AFFO. In this section, we refer to AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders as “AFFO (common stockholders).” Adjusted EBITDA, Nareit FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO and AFFO (common stockholders) are not intended to replace net income or any other performance measures determined in accordance with GAAP. None of Adjusted EBITDA, Nareit FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO or AFFO (common stockholders) represents cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and, therefore, these measures should not be considered indicative of cash flows from operating activities, as a measure of liquidity or a measure of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. Rather, Adjusted EBITDA, Nareit FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO and AFFO (common stockholders) are presented as we believe each is a useful indicator of our current operating performance. We believe that these metrics are useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because (1) each is a key measure 27 Table of Contents used by our management team for decision making purposes and for evaluating our operating segments’ performance; (2) Adjusted EBITDA is a component underlying our credit ratings; (3) Adjusted EBITDA is widely used in the telecommunications real estate sector to measure operating performance as depreciation, amortization and accretion may vary significantly among companies depending upon accounting methods and useful lives, particularly where acquisitions and non-operating factors are involved; (4) Consolidated AFFO is widely used in the telecommunications real estate sector to adjust Nareit FFO (common stockholders) for items that may otherwise cause material fluctuations in Nareit FFO (common stockholders) growth from period to period that would not be representative of the underlying performance of property assets in those periods; (5) each provides investors with a meaningful measure for evaluating our period-to-period operating performance by eliminating items that are not operational in nature; and (6) each provides investors with a measure for comparing our results of operations to those of other companies, particularly those in our industry. Our measurement of Adjusted EBITDA, Nareit FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO and AFFO (common stockholders) may not, however, be fully comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA, Nareit FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO and AFFO (common stockholders) to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, have been included below. 28 Table of Contents Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018 For a discussion of our 2019 Results of Operations, including a discussion of our financial results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, refer to Part I, Item 7 of our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 25, 2020 (the “2019 Form 10-K”). During the fourth quarter of 2020, as a result of the InSite Acquisition, we updated our reportable segments to rename U.S. property and Asia property to U.S. & Canada property and Asia-Pacific property, respectively. The change of our reportable segments names is solely reflective of the inclusion of Canada and Australia in our business operations, as a result of the InSite Acquisition, and had no impact on our consolidated financial statements for any prior periods. Historical financial information included in Part I, Item 7 of the 2019 Form 10-K has not been adjusted. Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in millions, except percentages) Revenue Year Ended December 31, Percent Change 2020 vs 2019 2020 2019 Property U.S. & Canada $ 4,517.0 $ 4,188.7 8 % Asia-Pacific 1,139.4 1,217.0 (6) Africa 890.2 583.9 52 Europe 149.6 134.6 11 Latin America 1,257.4 1,340.7 (6) Total property 7,953.6 7,464.9 7 Services 87.9 115.4 (24) Total revenues $ 8,041.5 $ 7,580.3 6 % Year ended December 31, 2020 U.S. & Canada property segment revenue growth of $328.3 million was attributable to: • Tenant billings growth of $196.1 million, which was driven by: ◦ $134.3 million due to colocations and amendments; ◦ $57.4 million from contractual escalations, net of churn (as discussed above, we expect that our churn rate will be elevated for a period of several years pursuant to the terms of the T-Mobile MLA); and ◦ $16.1 million generated from newly acquired or constructed sites; ◦ Partially offset by a decrease of $11.7 million from other tenant billings; and • An increase of $132.2 million in other revenue, which includes a $135.1 million increase due to straight-line accounting as a result of the T-Mobile MLA and the full year to date impact of the our master lease agreement entered into with AT&T in August 2019. Segment revenue growth was not meaningfully impacted by foreign currency translation related to fluctuations in the Canadian Dollar. The InSite Acquisition did not meaningfully impact revenue growth during the current period due to the timing of the closing in December 2020. We expect the assets acquired from InSite to generate approximately $150 million in property revenue in 2021. Asia-Pacific property segment revenue decrease of $77.6 million was attributable to: • A decrease of $30.3 million in other revenue, primarily due to a decrease in tenant settlement payments received attributable to prior tenant cancellations; and • A decrease of $8.1 million in pass-through revenue; • Partially offset by an increase of $18.3 million in tenant billings, which was driven by: ◦ $69.0 million due to colocations and amendments; and ◦ $19.6 million generated from newly acquired or constructed sites; ◦ Partially offset by: ▪ A decrease of $69.4 million resulting from churn in excess of contractual escalations; and ▪ A decrease of $0.9 million from other tenant billings. 29 Table of Contents Segment revenue decline included a decrease of $57.5 million attributable to the negative impact of foreign currency translation related to fluctuations in Indian Rupee (“INR”). Africa property segment revenue growth of $306.3 million was attributable to: • Tenant billings growth of $245.0 million, which was driven by: ◦ $206.2 million generated from newly acquired or constructed sites, primarily due to the Eaton Towers Acquisition; ◦ $24.9 million due to colocations and amendments; ◦ $13.1 million from contractual escalations, net of churn; and ◦ $0.8 million from other tenant billings; • An increase of $71.0 million in pass-through revenue, including amounts related to the Eaton Towers Acquisition; and • An increase of $30.7 million in other revenue. Segment revenue growth was partially offset by a decrease of $40.4 million attributable to the negative impact of foreign currency translation, which included, among others, $16.7 million related to fluctuations in South African Rand and $11.6 million related to fluctuations in Ghanaian Cedi. Europe property segment revenue growth of $15.0 million was attributable to: • Tenant billings growth of $6.7 million, which was driven by: ◦ $4.1 million due to colocations and amendments; ◦ $4.0 million generated from newly acquired or constructed sites, primarily attributable to the Orange Acquisition; and ◦ $0.2 million from other tenant billings; ◦ Partially offset by a decrease of $1.6 million resulting from churn in excess of contractual escalations; • An increase of $5.2 million in other revenue; and • An increase of $0.1 million in pass-through revenue. Segment revenue growth included an increase of $3.0 million attributable to the positive impact of foreign currency translation related to fluctuations in EUR. Latin America property segment revenue decrease of $83.3 million was attributable to: • A decrease of $15.7 million in other revenue, primarily due to the nonrecurrence of an $11.6 million tenant settlement payment in Mexico in the prior-year period; • Partially offset by an increase of $46.7 million in pass-through revenue and an increase of $108.1 million in tenant billings, which was driven by: ◦ $43.5 million generated from newly acquired or constructed sites, primarily due to the Entel Acquisition; ◦ $35.4 million due to colocations and amendments; ◦ $25.6 million from contractual escalations, net of churn; and ◦ $3.6 million from other tenant billings. Segment revenue decline included a decrease of $222.4 million attributable to the negative impact of foreign currency translation, which included, among others, $149.2 million related to fluctuations in Brazilian Real, $49.6 million related to fluctuations in Mexican Peso and $11.9 million related to fluctuations in Colombian Peso. The decrease in services segment revenue of $27.5 million was primarily attributable to a decrease in site application, zoning and permitting services. Gross Margin Year Ended December 31, Percent Change 2020 vs 2019 2020 2019 Property U.S. & Canada $ 3,709.0 $ 3,380.8 10 % Asia-Pacific 478.0 501.1 (5) Africa 592.5 374.9 58 Europe 121.5 106.8 14 Latin America 864.9 929.4 (7) Total property 5,765.9 5,293.0 9 Services 51.4 73.3 (30) % 30 Table of Contents Year ended December 31, 2020 • The increase in U.S. & Canada property segment gross margin was primarily attributable to the increase in revenue described above. The InSite Acquisition did not meaningfully impact U.S. & Canada property segment gross margin during the current period due to the timing of the closing in December 2020. We expect the assets acquired from InSite to generate approximately $115 million in gross margin in 2021. • The decrease in Asia-Pacific property segment gross margin was primarily attributable to the decrease in revenue described above, partially offset by a decrease in direct expenses of $21.1 million, primarily due to a combination of (i) lower land rent costs, partially due to site decommissioning, and (ii) lower security and monitoring costs. Direct expenses also benefited by $33.4 million from the impact of foreign currency translation. • The increase in Africa property segment gross margin was primarily attributable to the increase in revenue described above, partially offset by an increase in direct expenses of $104.3 million, primarily due to the Eaton Towers Acquisition. Direct expenses also benefited by $15.6 million from the impact of foreign currency translation. • The increase in Europe property segment gross margin was primarily attributable to the increase in revenue described above and a decrease in direct expenses of $0.2 million. Direct expenses were negatively impacted by $0.5 million attributable to the impact of foreign currency translation. • The decrease in Latin America property segment gross margin was primarily attributable to the decrease in revenue described above and an increase in direct expenses of $52.5 million, primarily due to the Entel Acquisition. Direct expenses also benefited by $71.3 million from the impact of foreign currency translation. • The decrease in services segment gross margin was primarily due to the decrease in revenue described above, partially offset by a decrease in direct expenses of $5.6 million. Selling, General, Administrative and Development Expense (“SG&A”) Year Ended December 31, Percent Change 2020 vs 2019 2020 2019 Property U.S. & Canada $ 162.2 $ 175.5 (8) % Asia-Pacific 97.4 99.9 (3) Africa 94.4 53.7 76 Europe 23.0 23.2 (1) Latin America 93.1 101.0 (8) Total property 470.1 453.3 4 Services 14.8 12.0 23 Other 293.8 265.1 11 Total selling, general, administrative and development expense $ 778.7 $ 730.4 7 % Year Ended December 31, 2020 • The decrease in our U.S. & Canada property segment SG&A was primarily driven by a decrease in legal costs as compared to the prior-year period and lower travel and discretionary spending as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and stay-at-home orders. • The decrease in our Asia-Pacific property segment SG&A was primarily driven by the benefit of foreign currency translation on SG&A and lower travel spending, partially offset by increased personnel costs and an increase in bad debt expense of $3.1 million. • The increase in our Africa property segment SG&A was primarily driven by increased personnel costs to support our business, including due to the Eaton Towers Acquisition, and an increase in bad debt expense of $23.5 million as a result of receivable reserves with certain tenants. • Our Europe property segment SG&A remained relatively consistent as compared to the prior-year period. • The decrease in our Latin America property segment SG&A was primarily driven by the benefit of foreign currency translation on SG&A, partially offset by increased personnel costs, including costs to support our fiber business. 31 Table of Contents • The increase in our services segment SG&A was primarily driven by an increase in personnel costs, partially offset by lower travel and discretionary spending as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and stay-at-home orders. • The increase in other SG&A was primarily attributable to an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $9.2 million and an increase in corporate SG&A, including an increase in personnel costs and charitable contributions.

Depreciation, Amortization and Accretion Year Ended December 31, Percent Change 2020 vs 2019 2020 2019 Depreciation, amortization and accretion $ 1,882.3 $ 1,778.4 6 % The increase in depreciation, amortization and accretion expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily attributable to the acquisition, lease or construction of new sites since the beginning of the prior-year period, including due to the Eaton Towers Acquisition and the Entel Acquisition, which resulted in increases in property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization, partially offset by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Other Operating Expenses Year Ended December 31, Percent Change 2020 vs 2019 2020 2019 Other operating expenses $ 265.8 $ 166.3 60 % The increase in other operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily attributable to increases in impairment charges of $128.6 million, including an increase of $66.2 million in impairment charges related to Right-of-use assets. These items were partially offset by a decrease in losses on sales or disposals of assets of $27.8 million and a one-time benefit in Brazil in the current period. 32 Table of Contents Total Other Expense Year Ended December 31, Percent Change 2020 vs 2019 2020 2019 Total Other expense $ 1,066.4 $ 772.0 38 % Total other expense consists primarily of interest expense and realized and unrealized foreign currency gains and losses. We record unrealized foreign currency gains or losses as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations primarily associated with our intercompany notes and similar unaffiliated balances denominated in a currency other than the subsidiaries’ functional currencies. The increase in total other expense during the year ended December 31, 2020 was due to foreign currency losses of $216.4 million in the current period, as compared to foreign currency gains of $6.1 million in the prior-year period, and a loss on retirement of long-term obligations of $71.8 million in the current period, attributable to the repayment of our 5.900% senior unsecured notes due 2021 (the “5.900% Notes”), our 3.300% senior unsecured notes due 2021 (the “3.300% Notes”) and our 3.450% senior unsecured notes due 2021 (the “3.450% Notes”), as compared to a loss on retirement of long-term obligations of $22.2 million during the prior-year period, primarily attributable to the repayment of our 5.050% senior unsecured notes due 2020 (the “5.050% Notes”). Income Tax Provision (Benefit) Year Ended December 31, Percent Change 2020 vs 2019 2020 2019 Income tax provision (benefit) $ 129.6 $ (0.2) (64,900) % Effective tax rate 7.1 % (0.0) % As a REIT, we may deduct earnings distributed to stockholders against the income generated by our REIT operations. In addition, we are able to offset certain income by utilizing our NOLs, subject to specified limitations. Consequently, the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations for each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 differs from the federal statutory rate. The change in the income tax provision (benefit) for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily attributable to a $113.0 million one-time tax benefit included in the prior-year period arising from revaluing our net deferred tax liability due to tax law changes in India, partially offset by changes in the valuation allowance in the current year.

For the year ended December 31, 2019, relates to the payment of capitalized interest associated with the shareholder loan previously owed to our joint venture partner in Ghana. These long-term deferred interest payments were previously expensed but excluded from Consolidated AFFO. (4) Includes losses (gains) on foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations of $216.4 million and ($6.1 million), respectively. (5) Primarily includes acquisition-related costs and integration costs. (6) Includes adjustments for the impact on both Nareit FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders as well as the other line items included in the calculation of Consolidated AFFO. Year Ended December 31, 2020 The decrease in net income was primarily due to (i) an increase in other expense, attributable to an increase in net foreign currency losses, and a loss on retirement of long-term obligations of $71.8 million, attributable to the repayment of the 5.900% Notes, the 3.300% Notes and the 3.450% Notes, as compared to a loss on retirement of long-term obligations of $22.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily attributable to the repayment of the 5.050% Notes, (ii) a change in the income tax provision (benefit), (iii) an increase in depreciation, amortization and accretion expense and (iv) an increase in other operating expenses, primarily attributable to an increase in impairment charges, partially offset by an increase in our operating profit. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily attributable to the increase in our gross margin and was partially offset by an increase in SG&A, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense, of $39.1 million. The increase in Consolidated AFFO and AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders was primarily attributable to the increase in our operating profit, excluding the impact of straight-line accounting and decreases in capital improvement and corporate capital expenditures, which were partially offset by an increase in cash paid for interest, including previously deferred interest associated with the shareholder loans. The growth in AFFO attributable to American 34 Table of Contents Tower Corporation common stockholders was also impacted by lower adjustments for unconsolidated affiliates and noncontrolling interests in Africa, which is now fully consolidated. 35 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview During the year ended December 31, 2020, we increased our financial flexibility and our ability to grow our business while maintaining our long-term financial policies. Our significant 2020 financing transactions included: • Entry into (i) a $750.0 million unsecured term loan due February 12, 2021 (the “2020 Term Loan”) and (ii) the April 2020 Term Loan (as defined below), which was repaid in full during the year ended December 31, 2020. • Registered public offerings in an aggregate amount of $8.0 billion, including an aggregate amount of 1.4 billion EUR, of senior unsecured notes with maturities ranging from 2024 to 2051. • Redemption of the 5.900% Notes, our 2.800% senior unsecured notes due 2020 (the “2.800% Notes”), the 3.300% Notes and the 3.450% Notes for an aggregate amount of $2.7 billion. • Repayment of $350.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding under the American Tower Secured Revenue Notes, Series 2015-1, Class A (the “Series 2015-1 Notes”). • Establishment of an “at the market” stock offering program through which we may issue and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $1.0 billion (the “2020 ATM Program”).

The borrowings were used to repay existing indebtedness, including repayment of the InSite Debt and the 2020 Term Loan, and for general corporate purposes. Summary cash flow information is set forth below for the years ended December 31, (in millions): 2020 2019 2018 Net cash provided by (used for): Operating activities $ 3,881.4 $ 3,752.6 $ 3,748.3 Investing activities (4,784.6) (3,987.5) (2,749.5) Financing activities 1,215.3 521.7 (607.7) Net effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash (28.7) (13.7) (41.1) Net increase in cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash $ 283.4 $ 273.1 $ 350.0 We use our cash flows to fund our operations and investments in our business, including tower maintenance and improvements, communications site construction, managed network installations and tower and land acquisitions. Additionally, we use our cash flows to make distributions, including distributions of our REIT taxable income to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT under the Code. We may also repay or repurchase our existing indebtedness or equity from time to time. We typically fund our international expansion efforts primarily through a combination of cash on hand, intercompany debt and equity contributions. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we completed the acquisition of MTN’s noncontrolling interests in each of our joint ventures in Ghana and Uganda for total consideration of approximately $524.4 million (see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report), which resulted in an increase in our controlling interests in such joint ventures from 51% to 100%. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we redeemed Tata Teleservices Limited and Tata Sons’ remaining combined holdings of ATC TIPL (see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report), for total consideration of INR 24.8 billion ($337.3 million at the date of redemption). As a result of the redemption, our controlling interest in ATC TIPL increased from 79% to 92% and the noncontrolling interest decreased from 21% to 8%. 36 Table of Contents In February 2021, we entered into an agreement with Macquarie SBI Infrastructure Investments Pte Limited and SBI Macquarie Infrastructure Trust, our remaining minority holders in ATC TIPL, to redeem 100% of their combined holdings in ATC TIPL (see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report) at a price of INR 175 per share, subject to certain adjustments. Accordingly, we expect to pay an amount equivalent to INR 12.9 billion (approximately $176.6 million) to redeem the shares in 2021, subject to regulatory approval. After the completion of the redemption, we will hold a 100% ownership interest in ATC TIPL. As of December 31, 2020, we had total outstanding indebtedness of $29.5 billion, with a current portion of $0.8 billion. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we generated sufficient cash flow from operations, together with borrowings under our credit facilities and cash on hand, to fund our capital expenditures and debt service obligations, as well as our required distributions. We believe the cash generated by operating activities during the year ending December 31, 2021, together with our increased borrowing capacity under our credit facilities, recently executed delayed draw term loans and bridge loan commitment, will be sufficient to fund our required distributions, capital expenditures, debt service obligations (interest and principal repayments) and signed acquisitions. Our material current and long term cash requirements are further described below. As of December 31, 2020, we had $1.5 billion of cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries, of which $570.5 million was held by our joint ventures. While certain subsidiaries may pay us interest or principal on intercompany debt, it has not been our practice to repatriate earnings from our foreign subsidiaries primarily due to our ongoing expansion efforts and related capital needs. However, in the event that we do repatriate any funds, we may be required to accrue and pay certain taxes. Cash Flows from Operating Activities For the year ended December 31, 2020, cash provided by operating activities increased $128.8 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.

The commitment fee for the 2019 Multicurrency Credit Facility and the 2019 Credit Facility ranges from 0.080% to 0.300% per annum, based upon our debt ratings, and is currently 0.110%. The 2019 Multicurrency Credit Facility, the 2019 Credit Facility and the 2019 Term Loan do not require amortization of principal and may be paid prior to maturity in whole or in part at our option without penalty or premium. We have the option of choosing either a defined base rate or LIBOR as the applicable base rate for borrowings under these bank facilities. 41 Table of Contents The loan agreements for each of the 2019 Multicurrency Credit Facility, the 2019 Credit Facility and the 2019 Term Loan contain certain reporting, information, financial and operating covenants and other restrictions (including limitations on additional debt, guaranties, sales of assets and liens) with which we must comply. Failure to comply with the financial and operating covenants of the loan agreements could not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under the revolving credit facilities, but may constitute a default, which could result in, among other things, the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable. Amendments to Bank Facilities —On February 10, 2021, we amended and restated the 2019 Multicurrency Credit Facility and the 2019 Credit Facility and entered into an amendment agreement with respect to the 2019 Term Loan.

The loan agreements for the 2021 Delayed Draw Term Loans contain certain reporting, information, financial and operating covenants and other restrictions (including limitations on additional debt, guaranties, sales of assets and liens) with which we must comply. Failure to comply with the financial and operating covenants of the loan agreements could not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under the revolving credit facilities, but may constitute a default, which could result in, among other things, the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable. Bridge Facility —In connection with entering into the Pending Telxius Acquisition, we entered into a commitment letter (the “Commitment Letter”), dated January 13, 2021, with Bank of America, N.A. and BofA Securities, Inc. (together, “BoA”) pursuant to which BoA has committed to provide up to 7.5 billion EUR (approximately $9.1 billion at date of signing) in bridge loans (the “Bridge Loan Commitment”) to ensure financing for the Pending Telxius Acquisition. Effective February 10, 2021, the Bridge Loan Commitment was reduced to 4.275 billion EUR (approximately $5.2 billion at the date of signing) as a result of an aggregate of 3.225 billion EUR (approximately $3.9 billion at the date of signing) of additional committed amounts under the 2019 Multicurrency Credit Facility, the 2019 Credit Facility and the 2021 Delayed Draw Term Loans, as described above. 42 Table of Contents The Commitment Letter contains, and the credit agreement in respect of the Bridge Loan Commitment, if any, will contain, certain customary conditions to funding, including, without limitation, (i) the execution and delivery of definitive financing agreements for the Bridge Loan Commitment and (ii) other customary closing conditions set forth in the Commitment Letter. The Company will pay certain customary commitment fees and, in the event it makes any borrowings in connection with the Bridge Loan Commitment, funding and other fees. India Indebtedness —We maintain several working capital facilities in India, most of which are subject to annual renewal. The working capital facilities bear interest at rates that consist of the applicable bank’s Marginal Cost of Funds based Lending Rate (as defined in the applicable agreement), plus a spread. Generally, the working capital facilities are payable on demand prior to maturity. Amounts outstanding and key terms of the India indebtedness consisted of the following as of December 31, 2020 (in millions, except percentages): Amount Outstanding (INR) Amount Outstanding (USD) Interest Rate (Range) Maturity Date (Range) Working capital facilities (1) — $ — 7.45% -8.75% March 18, 2021 - October 23, 2021 ______________ (1) 5.6 billion INR ($76.9 million) of borrowing capacity as of December 31, 2020. Subsequent to December 31, 2020, we entered into two additional working capital facilities in India, under which we currently have no amounts outstanding. Stock Repurchase Programs —In March 2011, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program, pursuant to which we are authorized to repurchase up to $1.5 billion of our common stock (the “2011 Buyback”). In addition to the 2011 Buyback, in December 2017, our Board of Directors approved an additional stock repurchase program, pursuant to which we are authorized to repurchase up to $2.0 billion of our common stock (the “2017 Buyback,” and, together with the 2011 Buyback, the “Buyback Programs”). During the year ended December 31, 2020, we repurchased 264,086 shares of our common stock under the 2011 Buyback for an aggregate of $56.0 million, including commissions and fees. We had no repurchases under the 2017 Buyback. Under each program, we are authorized to purchase shares from time to time through open market purchases or in privately negotiated transactions not to exceed market prices and subject to market conditions and other factors. With respect to open market purchases, we may use plans adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act in accordance with securities laws and other legal requirements, which allows us to repurchase shares during periods when we may otherwise be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of self-imposed trading blackout periods. These programs may be discontinued at any time. We have repurchased a total of 14.4 million shares of our common stock under the 2011 Buyback for an aggregate of $1.5 billion, including commissions and fees. We expect to continue managing the pacing of the remaining approximately $2.0 billion under the Buyback Programs in response to general market conditions and other relevant factors. We expect to fund any further repurchases of our common stock through a combination of cash on hand, cash generated by operations and borrowings under our credit facilities. Repurchases under the Buyback Programs are subject to, among other things, us having available cash to fund the repurchases. Sales of Equity Securities —We receive proceeds from sales of our equity securities pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan (the “ESPP”) and upon exercise of stock options granted under our equity incentive plan. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we received an aggregate of $98.1 million in proceeds upon exercises of stock options and sales pursuant to the ESPP. 2020 “At the Market” Stock Offering Program —In August 2020, we established the 2020 ATM Program. Sales under the 2020 ATM Program may be made by means of ordinary brokers’ transactions on the New York Stock Exchange or otherwise at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to prevailing market prices or, subject to our specific instructions, at negotiated prices. We intend to use the net proceeds of the 2020 ATM Program for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, the funding of acquisitions, additions to working capital and repayment or refinancing of existing indebtedness. As of December 31, 2020, we have not sold any shares of common stock under the 2020 ATM Program. Distributions— As a REIT, we must annually distribute to our stockholders an amount equal to at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain). Generally, we have distributed, and expect to continue to distribute, all or substantially all of our REIT taxable income after taking into consideration our utilization of NOLs. We have distributed an aggregate of approximately $9.4 billion to our common 43 Table of Contents stockholders, including the dividend paid in February 2021, primarily classified as ordinary income that may be treated as qualified REIT dividends under Section 199A of the Code for taxable years ending before 2026. The amount, timing and frequency of future distributions will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on various factors, a number of which may be beyond our control, including our financial condition and operating cash flows, the amount required to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT and reduce any income and excise taxes that we otherwise would be required to pay, limitations on distributions in our existing and future debt and preferred equity instruments, our ability to utilize NOLs to offset our distribution requirements, limitations on our ability to fund distributions using cash generated through our TRSs and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we paid $4.33 per share, or $1.9 billion, to common stockholders of record. In addition, we declared a distribution of $1.21 per share, or $537.6 million, paid on February 2, 2021 to our common stockholders of record at the close of business on December 28, 2020. We accrue distributions on unvested restricted stock units, which are payable upon vesting. The amount accrued for distributions payable related to unvested restricted stock units was $12.6 million and $14.3 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we paid $7.8 million of distributions upon the vesting of restricted stock units. For more details on the cash distributions paid to our common stockholders during the year ended December 31, 2020, see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. Material Cash Requirements — The following table summarizes material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations as of December 31, 2020 (in millions): 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 Thereafter Total Debt obligations (1) $ 789.8 $ 1,304.6 $ 3,318.9 $ 2,151.9 $ 7,566.0 $ 14,331.5 $ 29,462.7 Operating lease obligations (2) 901.1 869.0 836.4 798.0 751.8 6,423.4 10,579.7 44 Table of Contents ______________ (1) Includes aggregate principal maturities of long-term debt, including finance lease obligations (see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report). (2) Includes payments under non-cancellable initial terms, as well as payments for certain renewal periods at our option, which we expect to renew because failure to do so could result in a loss of the applicable communications sites and related revenues from tenant leases (see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report). Distributions— We expect that our 2021 total distributions paid to our common stockholders will be $2.3 billion. The amount, timing and frequency of future distributions will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors. Signed Acquisitions— On November 28, 2019, we entered into definitive agreements with Orange for the acquisition of up to approximately 2,000 communications sites in France over a period of up to five years for total consideration in the range of approximately 500.0 million EUR to 600.0 million EUR (approximately $550.5 million to $660.5 million at the date of signing) to be paid over the five-year term. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we completed the acquisition of 564 communications sites. The remaining communications sites are expected to close in tranches, subject to customary closing conditions. On December 19, 2019, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire approximately 3,200 communications sites in Chile and Peru from Entel PCS Telecomunicaciones S.A. and Entel Peru S.A. for total consideration of approximately $0.8 billion (as of the date of signing). We completed the acquisition of approximately 2,400 communications sites in December 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we completed the acquisition of an additional 530 communications sites pursuant to this agreement for an aggregate total purchase price of $137.7 million (as of the dates of acquisition), including value added tax. The remaining communications sites are expected to continue to close in tranches, subject to certain closing conditions. On January 13, 2021, we entered into the Pending Telxius Acquisition for approximately 7.7 billion EUR (approximately $9.4 billion at the date of signing), subject to limited adjustments. The Pending Telxius Acquisition is expected to close in tranches beginning in the second quarter of 2021, subject to customary closing conditions, including government and regulatory approval. Asset Retirement Obligations— We are required to remove our tower assets and remediate the leased land upon which certain of our tower assets are located. As of December 31, 2020, the estimated undiscounted future cash outlay for asset retirement obligations was $3.7 billion. Purchase of Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests— As described above, we expect to pay an amount equivalent to INR 12.9 billion (approximately $176.6 million) to redeem the shares of our remaining minority holders in ATC TIPL in 2021, subject to regulatory approval. Factors Affecting Sources of Liquidity Our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities, borrow funds under our credit facilities and maintain compliance with the contractual agreements governing our indebtedness. We believe that the debt agreements discussed below represent our material debt agreements that contain covenants, our compliance with which would be material to an investor’s understanding of our financial results and the impact of those results on our liquidity. Internally Generated Funds —Because the majority of our tenant leases are multiyear contracts, a significant majority of the revenues generated by our property operations as of the end of 2020 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. Accordingly, a key factor affecting our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is to maintain this recurring revenue and to convert it into operating profit by minimizing operating costs and fully achieving our operating efficiencies. In addition, our ability to increase cash flow from operating activities depends upon the demand for our communications sites and our related services and our ability to increase the utilization of our existing communications sites. Restrictions Under Loan Agreements Relating to Our Credit Facilities —The loan agreements for the 2019 Multicurrency Credit Facility, the 2019 Credit Facility, the 2019 Term Loan and the 2021 Delayed Draw Term Loans contain certain financial and operating covenants and other restrictions applicable to us and our subsidiaries that are not designated as unrestricted subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. These restrictions include limitations on additional debt, distributions and dividends, guaranties, sales of assets and liens. The loan agreements also contain covenants that establish financial tests with which we and our restricted subsidiaries must comply related to total leverage and senior secured leverage, as set forth in the table below. As 45 Table of Contents of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with each of these covenants. Compliance Tests For The 12 Months Ended December 31, 2020 ($ in billions) Ratio (1) Additional Debt Capacity Under Covenants (2) Capacity for Adjusted EBITDA Decrease Under Covenants (3) Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ≤ 6.00:1.00 ~$2.5 ~$0.4 Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio Senior Secured Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ≤ 3.00:1.00 ~$12.6 (4) ~$4.2 _______________ (1) Each component of the ratio as defined in the applicable loan agreement. (2) Assumes no change to Adjusted EBITDA. (3) Assumes no change to our debt levels. (4) Effectively, however, additional Senior Secured Debt under this ratio would be limited to the capacity under the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio. Under the terms of the agreements for the 2019 Multicurrency Credit Facility, the 2019 Credit Facility, the 2019 Term Loan and the 2021 Delayed Draw Term Loans, the Pending Telxius Acquisition is designated as a Qualified Acquisition, whereby our Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio is adjusted to not exceed 7:50 to 1:00 for four fiscal quarters following consummation of the Pending Telxius Acquisition. The loan agreements for our credit facilities also contain reporting and information covenants that require us to provide financial and operating information to the lenders within certain time periods. If we are unable to provide the required information on a timely basis, we would be in breach of these covenants. Failure to comply with the financial maintenance tests and certain other covenants of the loan agreements for our credit facilities could not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under these credit facilities, but may also constitute a default under these credit facilities, which could result in, among other things, the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable. If this were to occur, we may not have sufficient cash on hand to repay such indebtedness. The key factors affecting our ability to comply with the debt covenants described above are our financial performance relative to the financial maintenance tests defined in the loan agreements for these credit facilities and our ability to fund our debt service obligations. Based upon our current expectations, we believe our operating results during the next 12 months will be sufficient to comply with these covenants. Restrictions Under Agreements Relating to the 2015 Securitization and the Trust Securitizations— The indenture and related supplemental indenture governing the American Tower Secured Revenue Notes, Series 2015-2, Class A (the “Series 2015-2 Notes”) issued by GTP Acquisition Partners I, LLC (“GTP Acquisition Partners”) in a private securitization transaction in May 2015 (the “2015 Securitization”) and the loan agreement related to the securitization transactions completed in March 2013 (the “2013 Securitization”) and March 2018 (the “2018 Securitization” and, together with the 2013 Securitization, the “Trust Securitizations”) include certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions customary for transactions subject to rated securitizations. Among other things, GTP Acquisition Partners and American Tower Asset Sub, LLC and American Tower Asset Sub II, LLC (together, the “AMT Asset Subs”) are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets, subject to customary carve-outs for ordinary course trade payables and permitted encumbrances (as defined in the applicable agreements). Under the agreements, amounts due will be paid from the cash flows generated by the assets securing the Series 2015-2 Notes or the assets securing the nonrecourse loan that secures the Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2013-2A (the “Series 2013-2A Securities”), Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2018-1, Subclass A (the “Series 2018-1A Securities”), and the Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2018-1, Subclass R (the “Series 2018-1R Securities” and, together with the Series 2018-1A Securities, the “2018 Securities”) issued in the Trust Securitizations (the “Loan”), as applicable, which must be deposited into certain reserve accounts, and thereafter distributed, solely pursuant to the terms of the applicable agreement. On a monthly basis, after payment of all required amounts under the applicable agreement, subject to the conditions described in the table below, the excess cash flows generated from the operation of such assets are released to GTP Acquisition Partners or the AMT Asset Subs, as applicable, which can then be distributed to, and used by, us. As of December 31, 2020, $81.0 million held in such reserve accounts was classified as restricted cash. Certain information with respect to the 2015 Securitization and the Trust Securitizations is set forth below. The debt service coverage ratio (“DSCR”) is generally calculated as the ratio of the net cash flow (as defined in the applicable agreement) to the amount of interest, servicing fees and trustee fees required to be paid over the succeeding 12 months on the principal amount of the Series 2015-2 Notes or the Loan, as applicable, that will be outstanding on the payment date following such date of determination. 46 Table of Contents Issuer or Borrower Notes/Securities Issued Conditions Limiting Distributions of Excess Cash Excess Cash Distributed During Year Ended December 31, 2020 DSCR as of December 31, 2020 Capacity for Decrease in Net Cash Flow Before Triggering Cash Trap DSCR (1) Capacity for Decrease in Net Cash Flow Before Triggering Minimum DSCR (1) Cash Trap DSCR Amortization Period (in millions) (in millions) (in millions) 2015 Securitization (2) GTP Acquisition Partners American Tower Secured Revenue Notes, Series 2015-1 and Series 2015-2 1.30x, Tested Quarterly (3) (4)(5) $269.3 16.00x $270.5 $273.3 Trust Securitizations AMT Asset Subs Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2013-2A, Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2018-1, Subclass A and Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2018-1, Subclass R 1.30x, Tested Quarterly (3) (4)(6) $448.8 11.31x $597.9 $606.9 _______________ (1) Based on the net cash flow of the applicable issuer or borrower as of December 31, 2020 and the expenses payable over the next 12 months on the Series 2015-2 Notes or the Loan, as applicable. (2) On the June 2020 payment date, the Series 2015-1 Notes were repaid in full. As of December 31, 2020, none of the Series 2015-1 Notes remained outstanding. (3) Once triggered, a Cash Trap DSCR condition continues to exist until the DSCR exceeds the Cash Trap DSCR for two consecutive calendar quarters. During a Cash Trap DSCR condition, all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments, fund required reserves, pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and make other payments required under the applicable transaction documents, referred to as excess cash flow, will be deposited into a reserve account (the “Cash Trap Reserve Account”) instead of being released to the applicable issuer or borrower. (4) An amortization period commences if the DSCR is equal to or below 1.15x (the “Minimum DSCR”) at the end of any calendar quarter and continues to exist until the DSCR exceeds the Minimum DSCR for two consecutive calendar quarters. (5) No amortization period is triggered if the outstanding principal amount of a series has not been repaid in full on the applicable anticipated repayment date. However, in such event, additional interest will accrue on the unpaid principal balance of the applicable series, and such series will begin to amortize on a monthly basis from excess cash flow. (6) An amortization period exists if the outstanding principal amount has not been paid in full on the applicable anticipated repayment date and continues to exist until such principal has been repaid in full. A failure to meet the noted DSCR tests could prevent GTP Acquisition Partners or the AMT Asset Subs from distributing excess cash flow to us, which could affect our ability to fund our capital expenditures, including tower construction and acquisitions and to meet REIT distribution requirements. During an “amortization period,” all excess cash flow and any amounts then in the applicable Cash Trap Reserve Account would be applied to pay principal of the Series 2015-2 Notes or the Loan, as applicable, on each monthly payment date, and so would not be available for distribution to us. Further, additional interest will begin to accrue with respect to the Series 2015-2 Notes or subclass of the Loan from and after the anticipated repayment date at a per annum rate determined in accordance with the applicable agreement. With respect to the Series 2015-2 Notes, upon the occurrence of, and during, an event of default, the applicable trustee may, in its discretion or at the direction of holders of more than 50% of the aggregate outstanding principal of the Series 2015-2 Notes, declare the Series 2015-2 Notes immediately due and payable, in which case any excess cash flow would need to be used to pay holders of such notes. Furthermore, if GTP Acquisition Partners or the AMT Asset Subs were to default on the Series 2015-2 Notes or the Loan, the applicable trustee may seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of all or any portion of the 3,538 communications sites that secure the Series 2015-2 Notes or the 5,114 broadcast and wireless communications towers and related assets that secure the Loan, respectively, in which case we could lose such sites and the revenue associated with those assets. As discussed above, we use our available liquidity and seek new sources of liquidity to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, satisfy our distribution requirements and repay or repurchase our debt. If we determine that it is desirable or necessary to raise additional capital, we may be unable to do so, or such additional financing may be prohibitively expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness. Additionally, as further discussed under Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption “Risk Factors,” extreme market volatility and disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic 47 Table of Contents may impact our ability to raise additional capital through debt financing activities or our ability to repay or refinance maturing liabilities, or impact the terms of any new obligations. If we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise, we may not be able to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, satisfy our REIT distribution requirements and debt service obligations or refinance our existing indebtedness. In addition, our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities. As set forth under Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption “Risk Factors,” we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a small number of tenants and, consequently, a failure by a significant tenant to perform its contractual obligations to us could adversely affect our cash flow and liquidity. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We have reviewed our policies and estimates to determine our critical accounting policies for the year ended December 31, 2020. We have identified the following policies as critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition. This is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies. See note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for a summary of our significant accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP, with no need for management’s judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result. • Impairment of Assets—Assets Subject to Depreciation and Amortization : We review long-lived assets for impairment at least annually or whenever events, changes in circumstances or other indicators or evidence indicate that the carrying amount of our assets may not be recoverable. We review our tower portfolio, network location intangible and right-of-use assets for indicators of impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, typically at an individual tower basis. Possible indicators include a tower not having current tenant leases or having expenses in excess of revenues. A cash flow modeling approach is utilized to assess recoverability and incorporates, among other items, the tower location, the tower location demographics, the timing of additions of new tenants, lease rates and estimated length of tenancy and ongoing cash requirements. We review our tenant-related intangible assets on a tenant by tenant basis for indicators of impairment, such as high levels of turnover or attrition, non-renewal of a significant number of contracts or the cancellation or termination of a relationship. We assess recoverability by determining whether the carrying amount of the tenant-related intangible assets will be recovered primarily through projected undiscounted future cash flows. If the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of our long-lived assets is less than the carrying amount of the assets, an impairment loss may be recognized. Key assumptions included in the undiscounted cash flows are future revenue projections, estimates of ongoing tenancies and operating margins. An impairment loss would be based on the fair value of the asset, which is based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows to be provided from the asset. We record any related impairment charge in the period in which we identify such impairment. In October 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued a ruling regarding the definition of AGR and associated fees and charges, which was reaffirmed in March 2020, that may have a material financial impact on certain of our tenants which could affect their ability to perform their obligations under agreements with us. In September 2020, the Supreme Court of India defined the expected timeline of ten years for payments owed under the ruling. We will continue to monitor the status of these developments, as it is possible that the estimated future cash flows may differ from current estimates and changes in estimated cash flows from tenants in India could have an impact on previously recorded tangible and intangible assets, including amounts originally recorded as tenant-related intangibles. The carrying value of tenant-related intangibles in India was $1.0 billion as of December 31, 2020, which represents 10% of our consolidated balance of $10.1 billion. Additionally, a significant reduction in tenant related cash flows in India could also impact our tower portfolio and network location intangibles. The carrying values of our tower portfolio and network location intangibles in India were $1.0 billion and $410.9 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2020, which represent 13% and 11% of our consolidated balances of $8.0 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively. 48 Table of Contents • Impairment of Assets—Goodwill: We review goodwill for impairment at least annually (as of December 31) or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill is recorded in the applicable segment and assessed for impairment at the reporting unit level. We employ a discounted cash flow analysis when testing goodwill. The key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance, terminal sales growth rate, management’s expectations of future operating results and cash requirements, the current weighted average cost of capital and an expected tax rate. We compare the fair value of the reporting unit, as calculated under an income approach using future discounted cash flows, to the carrying amount of the applicable reporting unit. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount of the excess. The loss recognized is limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. During the year ended December 31, 2020, no potential goodwill impairment was identified as the fair value of each of our reporting units was in excess of its carrying amount. • Asset Retirement Obligations: When required, we recognize the fair value of obligations to remove our tower assets and remediate the leased land upon which certain of our tower assets are located. Generally, the associated retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related tower assets and depreciated over their estimated useful lives and the liability is accreted through the obligation’s estimated settlement date. We updated our assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation, which resulted in a net increase in the estimated obligation of $65.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. The change in 2020 primarily resulted from changes in timing of certain settlement date and cost assumptions. Fair value estimates of liabilities for asset retirement obligations generally involve discounting of estimated future cash flows. Periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is included in Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense in the consolidated statements of operations. The significant assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation are: timing of tower removals; cost of tower removals; timing and number of land lease renewals; expected inflation rates; and credit-adjusted risk-free interest rates that approximate our incremental borrowing rate. While we feel the assumptions are appropriate, there can be no assurances that actual costs and the probability of incurring obligations will not differ from these estimates. We will continue to review these assumptions periodically and we may need to adjust them as necessary. • Acquisitions : We evaluate each of our acquisitions under the accounting guidance framework to determine whether to treat an acquisition as an asset acquisition or a business combination. For those transactions treated as asset acquisitions, the purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired, with no recognition of goodwill. For those acquisitions that meet the definition of a business combination, we apply the acquisition method of accounting where assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value at the date of each acquisition, and the results of operations are included with our results from the dates of the respective acquisitions. Any excess of the purchase price paid over the amounts recognized for assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. We continue to evaluate acquisitions accounted for as business combinations for a period not to exceed one year after the applicable acquisition date of each transaction to determine whether any additional adjustments are needed to the allocation of the purchase price paid for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is typically determined by using either estimates of replacement costs or discounted cash flow valuation methods. When determining the fair value of tangible assets acquired, we must estimate the cost to replace the asset with a new asset taking into consideration such factors as age, condition and the economic useful life of the asset. When determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired, we must estimate the applicable discount rate and the timing and amount of future tenant cash flows, including rate and terms of renewal and attrition. • Revenue Recognition: Our revenue is derived from leasing the right to use our communications sites and the land on which the sites are located (the “lease component”) and from the reimbursement of costs incurred in operating the communications sites and supporting the tenants’ equipment as well as other services and contractual rights (the “non-lease component”). Most of our revenue is derived from leasing arrangements and is accounted for as lease revenue unless the timing and pattern of revenue recognition of the non-lease component differs from the lease component. If the timing and pattern of the non-lease component revenue recognition differs from that of the lease component, we separately determine the stand-alone selling prices and pattern of revenue recognition for each performance obligation. Our revenue from leasing arrangements, including fixed escalation clauses present in non-cancellable lease arrangements, is reported on a straight-line basis over the term of the respective leases when collectibility is probable. Escalation clauses tied to a consumer price index or other inflation-based indices, and other incentives present in lease agreements with our tenants, are excluded from the straight-line calculation. Total property straight-line revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were $322.0 million, $183.5 million and $87.6 million, 49 Table of Contents respectively. Amounts billed upfront in connection with the execution of lease agreements are initially deferred and reflected in Unearned revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and recognized as revenue over the terms of the applicable lease arrangements. Amounts billed or received for services prior to being earned are deferred and reflected in Unearned revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets until the criteria for recognition have been met. We derive the largest portion of our revenues, corresponding trade receivables and the related deferred rent asset from a small number of tenants in the telecommunications industry, with 55% of our revenues derived from three tenants. In addition, we have concentrations of credit risk in certain geographic areas. We mitigate the concentrations of credit risk with respect to notes and trade receivables by actively monitoring the creditworthiness of our borrowers and tenants. In recognizing tenant revenue we assess the collectibility of both the amounts billed and the portion recognized on a straight-line basis. This assessment takes tenant credit risk and business and industry conditions into consideration to ultimately determine the collectibility of the amounts billed. To the extent the amounts, based on management’s estimates, may not be collectible, recognition is deferred until such point as the uncertainty is resolved. Any amounts that were previously recognized as revenue and subsequently determined to be uncollectible are charged to bad debt expense. Accounts receivable are reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts related to estimated losses resulting from a tenant’s inability to make required payments and allowances for amounts invoiced whose collectibility is not reasonably assured. • Rent Expense and Lease Accounting: Many of the leases underlying our tower sites have fixed rent escalations, which provide for periodic increases in the amount of ground rent payable over time. In addition, certain of our tenant leases require us to exercise available renewal options pursuant to the underlying ground lease if the tenant exercises its renewal option. Our calculation of the lease liability includes straight-line ground rent expense for these leases based on the term of the underlying ground lease plus all periods, if any, for which failure to renew the lease imposes an economic penalty to us such that renewal appears to be reasonably assured. Effective January 1, 2019, we adopted the new lease standard using the modified retrospective method applied to lease arrangements that were in place on the transition date. The new lease accounting guidance required us to recognize a right-of-use lease asset and lease liability for operating and finance leases. The right-of-use asset is measured as the sum of the lease liability, prepaid or accrued lease payments, any initial direct costs incurred and any other applicable amounts. The calculation of the lease liability requires us to make certain assumptions for each lease, including lease term and discount rate implicit in each lease, which could significantly impact the gross lease obligation, the duration and the present value of the lease liability. When calculating the lease term, we consider the renewal, cancellation and termination rights available to us and the lessor. We determine the discount rate by calculating the incremental borrowing rate on a collateralized basis at the commencement of a lease or upon a change in the lease term. • Income Taxes: Accounting for income taxes requires us to estimate the timing and impact of amounts recorded in our financial statements that may be recognized differently for tax purposes. To the extent that the timing of amounts recognized for financial reporting purposes differs from the timing of recognition for tax reporting purposes, deferred tax assets or liabilities are required to be recorded. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. We do not expect to pay federal income taxes on our REIT taxable income. We periodically review our deferred tax assets, and we record a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets. Valuation allowances would be reversed as a reduction to the provision for income taxes, if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based on changes in facts and circumstances relevant to the assets’ recoverability. We recognize the benefit of uncertain tax positions when, in management’s judgment, it is more likely than not that positions we have taken in our tax returns will be sustained upon examination, which are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. We adjust our tax liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information or information not previously available. Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which additional information is available or the position is ultimately settled under audit. 50 Table of Contents Accounting Standards Update For a discussion of recent accounting standards updates, see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.

(b) Variable rate debt consisted of: the 2020 Term Loan, which was subsequently repaid in full on February 5, 2021; the 2019 Multicurrency Credit Facility, which matures on June 28, 2024; the 2019 Credit Facility, which matures on January 31, 2026; the 2019 Term Loan, which matures on January 31, 2025; and the Colombian credit facility, which amortizes through April 24, 2021. (c) Based on rates effective as of December 31, 2020. (d) As of December 31, 2020, the interest rate swap agreement in Colombia was included in Other non-current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. (e) Represents the fixed rate of interest based on contractual notional amount as a percentage of the total notional amount. The interest rate consists of fixed interest of 5.37%, per the interest rate agreement, and a fixed margin of 4.00%, per the loan agreement for the Colombian credit facility. (f) As of December 31, 2020, the interest rate swap agreements in the U.S. were included in Other non-current assets on the consolidated balance sheet. (g) Represents the weighted average variable rate of interest based on contractual notional amount as a percentage of total notional amounts. Interest Rate Risk As of December 31, 2020, we have one interest rate swap agreement related to debt in Colombia. This swap has been designated as a cash flow hedge, has a notional amount of $8.7 million, has an interest rate of 5.37% and expires in April 2021. We also have three interest rate swap agreements related to the 2.250% Notes. These swaps have been designated as fair value hedges, have an aggregate notional amount of $600.0 million, an interest rate of one-month LIBOR plus applicable spreads and expire in January 2022. In addition, we have three interest rate swap agreements related to a portion of the 3.000% Notes. These swaps have been designated as fair value hedges, have an aggregate notional amount of $500.0 million, an interest rate of one-month LIBOR plus applicable spreads and expire in June 2023. Changes in interest rates can cause interest charges to fluctuate on our variable rate debt. Variable rate debt as of December 31, 2020 consisted of $2.3 billion under the 2019 Credit Facility, $1.0 billion under the 2019 Term Loan, $750.0 million under the 2020 Term Loan, $600.0 million under the interest rate swap agreements related to the 2.250% Notes, $500.0 million under the interest rate swap agreements related to the 3.000% Notes and $2.9 million under the Colombian credit facility after giving effect to our interest rate swap agreements. A 10% increase in current interest rates would result in an additional $6.1 million of interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020. Foreign Currency Risk 51 Table of Contents We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily in connection with our foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures internationally. Any transaction denominated in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar is reported in U.S. Dollars at the applicable exchange rate. All assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. Dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of the applicable fiscal reporting period and all revenues and expenses are translated at average rates for the period. The cumulative translation effect is included in equity as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We may enter into additional foreign currency financial instruments in anticipation of future transactions to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. For the year ended December 31, 2020, 42% of our revenues and 52% of our total operating expenses were denominated in foreign currencies. As of December 31, 2020, we have incurred intercompany debt that is not considered to be permanently reinvested, and similar unaffiliated balances that were denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the subsidiary in which it is recorded. As this debt had not been designated as being a long-term investment in nature, any changes in the foreign currency exchange rates will result in unrealized gains or losses, which will be included in our determination of net income. An adverse change of 10% in the underlying exchange rates of our unsettled intercompany debt and similar unaffiliated balances would result in $129.2 million of unrealized losses that would be included in Other expense in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020. ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA See Item 15 (a). ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures We have established disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that material information relating to us, including our consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to the officers who certify our financial reports and to other members of senior management and the Board of Directors. Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2020 and designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the requisite time periods specified in the applicable rules and forms, and that it is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 52 Table of Contents Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. As discussed in Item 1 of this Annual Report under the caption “Business” and in note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report, we completed the InSite Acquisition on December 23, 2020. As permitted by the rules and regulations of the SEC, we excluded from our assessment the internal control over financial reporting at InSite, whose financial statements reflect total assets and revenues constituting 8% and 0%, respectively, of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of, and for the year ended, December 31, 2020. In making its assessment of internal control over financial reporting, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) . Based on this assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2020, our internal control over financial reporting is effective. Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm that audited our financial statements included in this Annual Report, has issued an attestation report on management’s internal control over financial reporting, which is included in this Item 9A under the caption “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm.” Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2020 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. As set forth above, we excluded from our assessment the internal control over financial reporting at InSite for the year ended December 31, 2020. We consider InSite material to our results of operations, financial position and cash flows, and we are in the process of integrating the internal control procedures of InSite into our internal control structure. 53 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of American Tower Corporation Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of American Tower Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020, of the Company and our report dated February 25, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. As described in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at InSite Wireless Group, LLC (“InSite”), which was acquired on December 23, 2020, and whose financial statements constitute 8% of total assets and 0% of total revenues of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at InSite. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP Boston, Massachusetts February 25, 2021 54 Table of Contents PART III ITEM 10.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 25, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Revenue Recognition for Significant Contract Modifications - Refer to Notes 1 and 4 to the financial statements Critical Audit Matter Description The Company’s contracts with major tenants are often governed by a master lease agreement that contains terms and provisions governing the tenant’s right to use the Company’s telecommunications sites and the land on which the sites are located (the “lease component”) and the tenant’s responsibility for reimbursement of various costs incurred by the Company in operating the telecommunications towers and supporting the tenant’s equipment as well as other services and contractual rights (the “non-lease components”). The master lease agreements contain both lease and non-lease components, may contain unusual or non-standard terms, and often pertain to many of the Company’s telecommunications sites. In the current year, the Company amended a master lease agreement with a major tenant. Management of the Company exercised significant judgment in determining the appropriate revenue recognition for the amended master lease agreement, including the following: • Determination of the lease and non-lease components and whether they should be accounted for as a combined lease component or separately. F-2 Table of Contents • Determination of the stand-alone selling prices for each performance obligation in the master lease agreement if not accounted for with the lease component. • Determination of the fixed and variable consideration in the master lease agreement, the impact of cancellation and renewal provisions, the estimated term of each of the individual contracts impacted by the master lease agreement, and the pattern of recognition for each lease component or performance obligation. We identified the amended master lease agreement with a major tenant as a critical audit matter because the audit effort required to evaluate the Company’s judgments in determining the appropriate revenue recognition for the impact of a multi-faceted, complex master lease agreement entered into with the major tenant was extensive. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our principal audit procedures related to the Company’s amended master lease agreement with the major tenant included the following: • We tested the effectiveness of internal controls related to the Company’s process for evaluating the proper accounting for the master lease agreement. • We evaluated the Company’s significant accounting policies related to the master lease agreement for reasonableness and compliance with the applicable accounting standards. • We evaluated the master lease agreement and performed the following procedures: ◦ Obtained and evaluated the documents that were part of the overall master lease agreement. ◦ Tested the Company’s identification of the significant terms for completeness and accuracy, including the identification of the lease and non-lease components, cancellation and renewal provisions, estimated term and fixed and variable consideration. ◦ Assessed the terms and provisions in the master lease agreement and evaluated the appropriateness of the Company’s application of their accounting policies, along with their use of estimates, in the determination of revenue recognition conclusions. • We tested the mathematical accuracy of the Company’s determination of revenue and the associated timing of revenue recognized in the financial statements. InSite Wireless Group, LLC Acquisition – Refer to Notes 1, 5 and 7 to the financial statements Critical Audit Matter Description The Company completed the acquisition of InSite Wireless Group, LLC (“InSite”) for the total consideration of $3.5 billion on December 23, 2020. The Company accounted for the transaction with InSite under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. Accordingly, the purchase price was allocated on a preliminary basis to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values on the acquisition date including property, plant & equipment of $516 million, intangible assets of $1,783 million, income tax liabilities of $117 million and goodwill of $1,354 million. Of the identified intangible assets acquired, the most significant included tenant relationship intangible assets of $1,160 million and network location intangible assets of $623 million. The Company estimated the fair value of these two intangible assets using the multi-period excess earnings method, which is a discounted cash flow method that required the Company to make significant estimates and assumptions related to future cash flows, including those related to tenant growth and attrition rates, long-term growth rates, and discount rate. We identified the tenant relationship and network location intangible assets for InSite as a critical audit matter because of the significant estimates and assumptions the Company makes to calculate fair value of these assets for purposes of recording the acquisition. This required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of the Company’s forecasts of future cash flows as well as the selection of the tenant growth and attrition rates, long-term growth rates and discount rates, including the need to involve our internal fair value specialists. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our principal audit procedures related to the forecasts of future cash flows for the intangible assets and the selection of the tenant growth and attrition rates, long-term growth rates and discount rates included the following: F-3 Table of Contents • We tested the effectiveness of controls over the purchase price allocation, including controls over the Company’s projections of future cash flows and the selection of tenant growth and attrition rates, long-term growth rates and discount rates utilized in determining the fair value of the intangible assets. • We evaluated the reasonableness of the Company’s projections of future cash flows, including the selection of tenant growth and attrition rates by comparing the assumptions used in the projections to those of the in-place lease contracts assumed, external market sources, historical data of the Company’s similar contractual relationships, and results from other areas of the audit. • With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the valuation methodology, long-term growth rates and discount rates by: ◦ Testing the source information underlying the determination of the long-term growth rates and discount rates and testing the mathematical accuracy of the calculations. ◦ Developing a range of independent estimates for the discount rate and comparing those to the discount rate selected by the Company. /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP Boston, Massachusetts February 25, 2021 We have served as the Company's auditor since 1997.

F-9 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) 1. BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Business —American Tower Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, “ATC” or the “Company”) is one of the largest global real estate investment trusts and a leading independent owner, operator and developer of multitenant communications real estate. The Company’s primary business is the leasing of space on communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, wireless data providers, government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries. The Company refers to this business as its property operations. Additionally, the Company offers tower-related services in the United States, which the Company refers to as its services operations. These services include site application, zoning and permitting (“AZP”) and structural analysis, which primarily support the Company’s site leasing business, including the addition of new tenants and equipment on its sites. The Company’s portfolio primarily consists of towers that it owns and towers that it operates pursuant to long-term lease arrangements, as well as distributed antenna system (“DAS”) networks, which provide seamless coverage solutions in certain in-building and outdoor wireless environments. In addition to the communications sites in its portfolio, the Company manages rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements. The Company also holds other telecommunications infrastructure, fiber and property interests that it leases primarily to communications service providers and third-party tower operators. American Tower Corporation is a holding company that conducts its operations through its directly and indirectly owned subsidiaries and joint ventures. ATC’s principal domestic operating subsidiaries are American Towers LLC and SpectraSite Communications, LLC. ATC conducts its international operations primarily through its subsidiary, American Tower International, Inc., which in turn conducts operations through its various international holding and operating subsidiaries and joint ventures. The Company operates as a real estate investment trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes (“REIT”). Accordingly, the Company generally is not required to pay U.S. federal income taxes on income generated by its REIT operations, including the income derived from leasing space on its towers, as it receives a dividends paid deduction for distributions to stockholders that generally offsets its REIT income and gains. However, the Company remains obligated to pay U.S. federal income taxes on earnings from its domestic taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRSs”). In addition, the Company’s international assets and operations, regardless of their classification for U.S. tax purposes, continue to be subject to taxation in the jurisdictions where those assets are held or those operations are conducted. The use of TRSs enables the Company to continue to engage in certain businesses and jurisdictions while complying with REIT qualification requirements. The Company may, from time to time, change the election of previously designated TRSs to be included as part of the REIT. As of December 31, 2020, the Company’s REIT-qualified businesses included its U.S. tower leasing business and a majority of its U.S. indoor DAS networks business and services segment, as well as most of its operations in Mexico, Germany, Costa Rica, Nigeria, France, Canada and Australia. Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation —The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and those entities in which it has a controlling interest. Investments in entities that the Company does not control are accounted for using the equity method or as investments in equity securities, depending upon the Company’s ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. As of December 31, 2020, the Company holds (i) a 51 % controlling interest in ATC Europe B.V. (“ATC Europe”), a joint venture that primarily consists of the Company’s operations in France, Germany and Poland (PGGM holds a 49 % noncontrolling interest) and (ii) a 92 % controlling interest in ATC Telecom Infrastructure Private Limited (“ATC TIPL”), formerly Viom Networks Limited (“Viom”), in India (the remaining shareholders, as discussed in note 15, hold a 8 % noncontrolling interest). During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of MTN Group Limited’s (“MTN”) 49 % redeemable noncontrolling interests in each of the Company’s joint ventures in Ghana and Uganda for total consideration of approximately $ 524.4 million, including a net adjustment of $ 1.4 million made during the three months ended March 31, 2020, which resulted in an increase in the Company’s controlling interests in such joint ventures from 51 % to 100 %. The purchase is reflected in the consolidated statements of equity as increases of $ 142.2 million in each of Additional Paid-in Capital and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss and in the consolidated balance sheets as a reduction of $ 524.4 million in Redeemable noncontrolling interests. Reportable Segments — During the fourth quarter of 2020, as a result of the Company’s acquisition of InSite Wireless Group, LLC (“InSite,” and the acquisition, the “InSite Acquisition”), the Company updated its reportable segments to rename U.S. F-10 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) property and Asia property to U.S. & Canada property and Asia-Pacific property, respectively. The Company continues to report its results in six segments – U.S. & Canada property, Asia-Pacific property, Africa property, Europe property, Latin America property and services, which are discussed further in note 21. The change in reportable segment names is solely reflective of the inclusion of Canada and Australia in the Company’s business operations, as a result of the InSite Acquisition, and had no impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements for any prior periods. Historical financial information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K has not been adjusted. Significant Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates —The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results may differ from those estimates, and such differences could be material to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The significant estimates in the accompanying consolidated financial statements include impairment of long-lived assets (including goodwill), asset retirement obligations, revenue recognition, rent expense and lease accounting, income taxes and accounting for business combinations and acquisitions of assets. The Company considers events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued as additional evidence for certain estimates or to identify matters that require additional disclosure. Accounts Receivable and Deferred Rent Asset —The Company derives the largest portion of its revenues and corresponding accounts receivable and the related deferred rent asset from a relatively small number of tenants in the telecommunications industry, and 55 % of its current-year revenues are derived from three tenants. The Company’s deferred rent asset is associated with non-cancellable tenant leases that contain fixed escalation clauses over the terms of the applicable lease in which revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company mitigates its concentrations of credit risk with respect to notes and trade receivables and the related deferred rent assets by actively monitoring the creditworthiness of its borrowers and tenants. In recognizing tenant revenue, the Company assesses the collectibility of both the amounts billed and the portion recognized in advance of billing on a straight-line basis. This assessment takes tenant credit risk and business and industry conditions into consideration to ultimately determine the collectibility of the amounts billed. To the extent the amounts, based on management’s estimates, may not be collectible, revenue recognition is deferred until such point as collectibility is determined to be reasonably assured. Any amounts that were previously recognized as revenue and subsequently determined to be uncollectible are charged to bad debt expense included in Selling, general, administrative and development expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Accounts receivable is reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts related to estimated losses resulting from a tenant’s inability to make required payments and allowances for amounts invoiced whose collectibility is not reasonably assured. These allowances are generally estimated based on payment patterns, days past due and collection history, and incorporate changes in economic conditions that may not be reflected in historical trends, such as tenants in bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization. Receivables are written-off against the allowances when they are determined to be uncollectible. Such determination includes analysis and consideration of the particular conditions of the account. Changes in the allowances were as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2020 (1) 2019 2018 Balance as of January 1, $ 163.3 $ 282.4 $ 131.0 Current year increases 105.6 104.3 157.8 Write-offs, recoveries and other (2) ( 21.3 ) ( 223.4 ) ( 6.4 ) Balance as of December 31, $ 247.6 $ 163.3 $ 282.4 _______________ (1) Year ended December 31, 2020 reflects the Company’s adoption of the current expected credit loss model for non-lease receivables. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements as the majority of the Company’s revenue is derived from its property operations and operating lease receivables are not within the scope of this guidance. (2) Amounts are primarily related to uncollectible amounts in India. In 2018, recoveries include recognition of revenue resulting from collections of previously reserved amounts. Functional Currency —The functional currency of each of the Company’s foreign operating subsidiaries is normally the respective local currency, except for Costa Rica and Argentina, where the functional currency is the U.S. Dollar. All foreign currency assets and liabilities held by the subsidiaries are translated into U.S. Dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the end of the applicable fiscal reporting period and all foreign currency revenues and expenses are translated at the average monthly exchange rates. Translation adjustments are reflected in equity as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss F-11 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) (“AOCL”) in the consolidated balance sheets and included as a component of Comprehensive income in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Gains and losses on foreign currency transactions are reflected in Other expense in the consolidated statements of operations. However, the effect from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on intercompany debt for which repayment is not anticipated in the foreseeable future is reflected in AOCL in the consolidated balance sheets and included as a component of Comprehensive income. The Company recorded the following net foreign currency losses: Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 Foreign currency losses recorded in AOCL $ 391.0 $ 45.8 $ 385.8 Foreign currency losses (gains) recorded in Other expense 216.4 ( 6.1 ) 4.5 Total foreign currency losses $ 607.4 $ 39.7 $ 390.3 Cash and Cash Equivalents —Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, demand deposits and short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less. The Company maintains its deposits at high-quality financial institutions and monitors the credit ratings of those institutions. Restricted Cash— Restricted cash includes cash pledged as collateral to secure obligations and all cash whose use is otherwise limited by contractual provisions. The reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash reported within the applicable balance sheet that sum to the total of the same such amounts shown in the statements of cash flows is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,746.3 $ 1,501.2 $ 1,208.7 Restricted cash 115.1 76.8 96.2 Total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 1,861.4 $ 1,578.0 $ 1,304.9 Property and Equipment —Property and equipment is recorded at cost or, in the case of acquired properties, at estimated fair value on the date acquired. Cost for self-constructed towers includes direct materials and labor and certain indirect costs associated with construction of the tower, such as transportation costs, employee benefits and payroll taxes. The Company begins the capitalization of costs during the pre-construction period, which is the period during which costs are incurred to evaluate the site, and continues to capitalize costs until the tower is substantially completed and ready for occupancy by a tenant. Labor and related costs capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were $ 51.1 million, $ 48.3 million and $ 55.0 million, respectively. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Augmentation and improvements that extend an asset’s useful life or enhance capacity are capitalized. Depreciation expense is recorded using the straight-line method over the assets’ estimated useful lives. Towers and related assets on leased land are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the term of the corresponding ground lease, taking into consideration lease renewal options and residual value. Towers or assets acquired through finance leases are recorded net at the present value of future minimum lease payments or the fair value of the leased asset at the inception of the lease. Property and equipment and assets held under finance leases are amortized over the shorter of the applicable lease term or the estimated useful life of the respective assets for periods generally not exceeding twenty years . The Company reviews its tower portfolio for indicators of impairment on an individual tower basis. Impairments primarily result from a tower not having current tenant leases or from having expenses in excess of revenues. The Company reviews other long-lived assets for impairment whenever events, changes in circumstances or other evidence indicate that the carrying amount of the Company’s assets may not be recoverable. The Company records impairment charges in Other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the Company identifies such impairment. F-12 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets —The Company reviews goodwill for impairment at least annually (as of December 31) or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill is recorded in the applicable segment and assessed for impairment at the reporting unit level. The Company employs a discounted cash flow analysis when testing goodwill for impairment. The key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance, terminal sales growth rate, management’s expectations of future operating results and cash requirements, the current weighted average cost of capital and an expected tax rate. The Company compares the fair value of the reporting unit, as calculated under an income approach using future discounted cash flows, to the carrying amount of the applicable reporting unit. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount of the excess. The loss recognized is limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, no potential impairment was identified, as the fair value of each of the reporting units was in excess of its carrying amount. Intangible assets that are separable from goodwill and are deemed to have a definite life are amortized over their useful lives, generally ranging from three to twenty years and are evaluated separately for impairment at least annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The Company reviews its network location intangible assets for indicators of impairment on an individual tower basis. Impairments primarily result from a tower not having current tenant leases or from having expenses in excess of revenues. The Company monitors its tenant-related intangible assets on a tenant by tenant basis for indicators of impairment, such as high levels of turnover or attrition, non-renewal of a significant number of contracts or the cancellation or termination of a relationship. The Company assesses recoverability by determining whether the carrying amount of the related assets will be recovered primarily through projected undiscounted future cash flows. If the Company determines that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, the Company measures any impairment loss based on the projected future discounted cash flows to be provided from the asset or available market information relative to the asset’s fair value, as compared to the asset’s carrying amount. The Company records impairment charges, which are discussed in note 17, in Other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the Company identifies such impairment. Derivative Financial Instruments —Derivatives are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value. If a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in AOCL, as well as a component of comprehensive income, and are recognized in the results of operations when the hedged item affects earnings. Changes in fair value of the ineffective portions of cash flow hedges are recognized in the results of operations. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, changes in value of the derivatives are recorded in Other expense in the consolidated statements of operations in the current period, along with the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. For derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognized in the results of operations in the period that the change occurs. The primary risks managed through the use of derivative instruments is interest rate risk, exposure to changes in the fair value of debt attributable to interest rate risk and currency risk. From time to time, the Company enters into interest rate swap agreements or foreign currency contracts to manage exposure to these risks. Under these agreements, the Company is exposed to counterparty credit risk to the extent that a counterparty fails to meet the terms of a contract. The Company’s exposure is limited to the current value of the contract at the time the counterparty fails to perform. The Company assesses, both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows or fair values of hedged items. The Company does not hold derivatives for trading purposes. Fair Value Measurements —The Company determines the fair value of its financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Asset Retirement Obligations —When required, the Company recognizes the fair value of obligations to remove its tower assets and remediate the leased land upon which certain of its tower assets are located. Generally, the associated retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related tower assets and depreciated over their estimated useful lives and the liability is accreted through the obligation’s estimated settlement date. Fair value estimates of asset retirement obligations generally involve discounting of estimated future cash flows associated with takedown costs. Periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is included in Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Adjustments are also made to the asset retirement obligation liability to reflect changes in the estimates of timing and amount of expected cash flows, with an offsetting adjustment made to the related long-lived tangible F-13 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) asset. The significant assumptions used in estimating the Company’s aggregate asset retirement obligation are: timing of tower removals; cost of tower removals; timing and number of land lease renewals; expected inflation rates; and credit-adjusted, risk-free interest rates that approximate the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. Income Taxes —As a REIT, the Company generally is not subject to U.S. federal income taxes on income generated by its REIT operations as it receives a dividends paid deduction for distributions to stockholders that generally offsets its REIT income and gains. However, the Company remains obligated to pay U.S. federal income taxes on certain earnings and continues to be subject to taxation in its foreign jurisdictions. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements reflect provisions for federal, state, local and foreign income taxes. The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The Company measures deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company periodically reviews its deferred tax assets, and provides valuation allowances if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets. Valuation allowances would be reversed as a reduction to the provision for income taxes if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based on changes in facts and circumstances relevant to the assets’ recoverability. The Company classifies uncertain tax positions as income tax liabilities in Other non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet, unless expected to be paid within one year. The Company reports penalties and tax-related interest expense as a component of the income tax provision and interest income from tax refunds as a component of Interest income in the consolidated statements of operations. Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) —Other comprehensive income (loss) refers to items excluded from net income that are recorded as an adjustment to equity, net of tax. The Company’s other comprehensive income (loss) primarily consisted of changes in fair value of effective derivative cash flow hedges, foreign currency translation adjustments and reclassification of unrealized losses on effective derivative cash flow hedges. The AOCL balance included accumulated foreign currency translation losses of $ 3.8 billion, $ 2.8 billion and $ 2.6 billion as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Distributions —As a REIT, the Company must annually distribute to its stockholders an amount equal to at least 90% of its REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain). Generally, the Company has distributed, and expects to continue to distribute, all or substantially all of its REIT taxable income after taking into consideration its utilization of net operating losses (“NOLs”). The amount, timing and frequency of future distributions will be at the sole discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend upon various factors, a number of which may be beyond the Company’s control, including the Company’s financial condition and operating cash flows, the amount required to maintain its qualification for taxation as a REIT and reduce any income and excise taxes that the Company otherwise would be required to pay, limitations on distributions in the Company’s existing and future debt and preferred equity instruments, the Company’s ability to utilize NOLs to offset the Company’s distribution requirements, limitations on its ability to fund distributions using cash generated through its TRSs and other factors that the Board of Directors may deem relevant. Acquisitions —For acquisitions that meet the definition of a business combination, the Company applies the acquisition method of accounting where assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value at the date of each acquisition, and the results of operations are included with those of the Company from the dates of the respective acquisitions. Any excess of the purchase price paid by the Company over the amounts recognized for assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. The Company continues to evaluate acquisitions for a period not to exceed one year after the applicable acquisition date of each transaction to determine whether any additional adjustments are needed to the allocation of the purchase price paid for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. All other acquisitions are accounted for as asset acquisitions and the purchase price is allocated to the net assets acquired with no recognition of goodwill. The purchase price is not subsequently adjusted. The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is typically determined by using either estimates of replacement costs or discounted cash flow valuation methods. When determining the fair value of tangible assets acquired, the Company must estimate the cost to replace the asset with a new asset taking into consideration such factors as age, condition and the economic useful life of the asset. When determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the F-14 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) Company must estimate the applicable discount rate and the timing and amount of future cash flows, including rate and terms of renewal and attrition. Revenue —The Company’s revenue is derived from leasing the right to use its communications sites and the land on which the sites are located (the “lease component”) and from the reimbursement of costs incurred by the Company in operating the communications sites and supporting the tenants’ equipment as well as other services and contractual rights (the “non-lease component”). Most of the Company’s revenue is derived from leasing arrangements and is accounted for as lease revenue unless the timing and pattern of revenue recognition of the non-lease component differs from the lease component. If the timing and pattern of the non-lease component revenue recognition differs from that of the lease component, the Company separately determines the stand-alone selling prices and pattern of revenue recognition for each performance obligation. Revenue related to DAS networks and fiber and other related assets results from agreements with tenants that are not leases. The Company’s revenue from leasing arrangements, including fixed escalation clauses present in non-cancellable lease arrangements, is reported on a straight-line basis over the term of the respective leases when collectibility is probable. Escalation clauses tied to a consumer price index (“CPI”), or other inflation-based indices, and other incentives present in lease agreements with the Company’s tenants are excluded from the straight-line calculation. Total property straight-line revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were $ 322.0 million, $ 183.5 million and $ 87.6 million, respectively. Non-lease revenue— Non-lease revenue consists primarily of revenue generated from DAS networks, fiber and other property related revenue. DAS networks and fiber arrangements require that the Company provide the tenant the right to use the applicable communications infrastructure. Performance obligations are satisfied over time for the duration of the arrangements. Other property related revenue streams, which include site inspections, are not material on either an individual or consolidated basis. Services revenue— The Company offers tower-related services in the United States. These services include AZP and structural analysis. There is a single performance obligation related to AZP and revenue is recognized over time based on milestones achieved, which are determined based on costs expected to be incurred. Structural analysis services may have more than one performance obligation, contingent upon the number of contracted services. Revenue is recognized at the point in time the services are completed. Some of the Company’s contracts with tenants contain multiple performance obligations. For these arrangements, the Company allocates revenue to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price, which is typically based on the price charged to tenants. Since most of the Company’s contracts are leases, costs to enter into lease arrangements are capitalized under the applicable lease accounting guidance. Costs incurred to obtain non-lease contracts that are capitalized primarily relate to DAS networks and are not material to the consolidated financial statements. The Company has excluded sales tax, value added tax and similar taxes from non-lease revenue. Revenue is disaggregated by geography in a manner consistent with the Company’s business segments, which are discussed further in note 21. A summary of revenue disaggregated by source and geography is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2020 U.S. & Canada Asia-Pacific Africa Europe Latin America Total Non-lease property revenue $ 258.4 $ 9.3 $ 13.8 $ 7.9 $ 118.4 $ 407.8 Services revenue 87.9 — — — — 87.9 Total non-lease revenue $ 346.3 $ 9.3 $ 13.8 $ 7.9 $ 118.4 $ 495.7 Property lease revenue 4,258.6 1,130.1 876.4 141.7 1,139.0 7,545.8 Total revenue $ 4,604.9 $ 1,139.4 $ 890.2 $ 149.6 $ 1,257.4 $ 8,041.5 Year Ended December 31, 2019 U.S. & Canada Asia-Pacific Africa Europe Latin America Total Non-lease property revenue $ 255.7 $ 8.8 $ 4.0 $ 5.1 $ 138.2 $ 411.8 Services revenue 115.4 — — — — 115.4 Total non-lease revenue $ 371.1 $ 8.8 $ 4.0 $ 5.1 $ 138.2 $ 527.2 Property lease revenue 3,933.0 1,208.2 579.9 129.5 1,202.5 7,053.1 Total revenue $ 4,304.1 $ 1,217.0 $ 583.9 $ 134.6 $ 1,340.7 $ 7,580.3 F-15 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) Information about non-lease receivables, contract assets and contract liabilities from contracts with tenants is as follows: December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Accounts receivable $ 77.2 $ 80.5 Prepaids and other current assets 21.8 8.3 Notes receivable and other non-current assets 23.7 21.3 Unearned revenue (1) 120.3 91.7 Other non-current liabilities (1) 432.4 379.2 _______________ (1) Includes capital contributions related to DAS networks. The Company records unearned revenue when payments are received from tenants in advance of the completion of the Company’s performance obligations. Long-term unearned revenue is included in Other non-current liabilities. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recognized $ 142.3 million of revenue that was previously included in the contract liabilities balances, primarily arising from balances as of December 31, 2019. The Company records unbilled receivables, which are included in Prepaids and other current assets, when it has completed a performance obligation prior to its ability to bill under the customer arrangement. Other contract assets are included in Notes receivable and other non-current assets. The Company did not record any change in unbilled receivables attributable to non-lease property revenue recognized during each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. The change in contract assets attributable to revenue recognized during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $ 6.8 million and $ 3.1 million, respectively. The Company does not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for agreements (i) with an original expected length of one year or less or (ii) for which it recognizes revenue at the amount to which it has the right to invoice for services performed. Lease Accounting and Rent Expense —The Company accounts for leases using a right-of-use model, which recognizes that, at the date of commencement, a lessee has a financial obligation to make lease payments to the lessor for the right to use the underlying asset during the lease term. The lessee recognizes a corresponding right-of-use asset related to this right. The Company recognizes a right-of-use lease asset and lease liability for operating and finance leases. The right-of-use asset is measured as the sum of the lease liability, prepaid or accrued lease payments, any initial direct costs incurred and any other applicable amounts. The Company reviews its right-of-use assets for impairment whenever events, changes in circumstances or other evidence indicate that the carrying amount of the Company’s assets may not be recoverable. The Company reviews its right-of-use assets for indicators of impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, as part of its tower portfolio. Impairments primarily result from a tower not having current tenant leases or from having expenses in excess of revenues. The Company records impairment charges in Other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the Company identifies such impairment. The calculation of the lease liability requires the Company to make certain assumptions for each lease, including lease term and discount rate implicit in each lease, which could significantly impact the gross lease obligation, the duration and the present value of the lease liability. When calculating the lease term, the Company considers the renewal, cancellation and termination rights available to the Company and the lessor. The Company determines the discount rate by calculating the incremental borrowing rate on a collateralized basis at the commencement of a lease or upon a change in the lease term. Many of the leases underlying the Company’s tower sites have fixed rent escalations, which provide for periodic increases in the amount of ground rent payable by the Company over time. In addition, certain of the Company’s tenant leases require the Company to exercise available renewal options pursuant to the underlying ground lease if the tenant exercises its renewal option. The Company’s calculation of the lease liability includes straight-line ground rent expense for these leases based on the term of the underlying ground lease plus all periods, if any, for which failure to renew the lease imposes an economic penalty to the Company such that renewal appears to be reasonably assured. The straight-line component of ground rent expense for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $ 51.6 million, $ 44.4 million and $ 57.9 million, respectively. Selling, General, Administrative and Development Expense —Selling, general and administrative expense consists of overhead expenses related to the Company’s property and services operations and corporate overhead costs not specifically allocable to F-16 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) any of the Company’s individual business operations. Development expense consists of costs related to the Company’s acquisition efforts, costs associated with new business initiatives and project cancellation costs. Stock-Based Compensation —Stock-based compensation expense is measured at the accounting measurement date based on the fair value of the award and is generally recognized as an expense over the service period, which typically represents the vesting period. The Company provides for accelerated vesting and extended exercise periods of stock options and restricted stock units upon an employee’s death or permanent disability, or upon an employee’s qualified retirement, provided certain eligibility criteria are met. Accordingly, the Company recognizes compensation expense for stock options and time-based restricted stock units (“RSUs”) over the shorter of (i) the four -year vesting period or (ii) the period from the date of grant to the date the employee becomes eligible for such benefits due to death, disability or qualified retirement, which may occur upon grant. The expense recognized includes the impact of forfeitures as they occur. The Company grants performance-based restricted stock units (“PSUs”) to its executive officers. Threshold, target and maximum parameters are established for a three -year performance period at the time of grant. The metrics are used to calculate the number of shares that will be issuable when the awards vest, which may range from zero to 200 % of the target amounts. The Company recognizes compensation expense for PSUs over the three -year vesting period, subject to adjustment based on the date the employee becomes eligible for retirement benefits as well as performance relative to grant parameters. The fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and the fair value of RSUs and PSUs is based on the fair value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. The Company recognizes all stock-based compensation expense in either Selling, general, administrative and development expense, costs of operations or as part of the costs associated with the construction of the tower assets. In connection with the vesting of restricted stock units, the Company withholds from issuance a number of shares of common stock to satisfy certain employee tax withholding obligations arising from such vesting. The shares withheld are considered constructively retired. The Company recognizes the fair value of the shares withheld in Additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has withheld from issuance an aggregate of 2.4 million shares, including 0.3 million shares related to the vesting of restricted stock units during the year ended December 31, 2020. Litigation Costs —The Company periodically becomes involved in various claims and lawsuits that are incidental to its business. The Company regularly monitors the status of pending legal actions to evaluate both the magnitude and likelihood of any potential loss. The Company accrues for these potential losses when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss, or possible range of loss, can be reasonably estimated. Should the ultimate losses on contingencies or litigation vary from estimates, adjustments to those liabilities may be required. The Company also incurs legal costs in connection with these matters and records estimates of these expenses, which are reflected in Selling, general, administrative and development expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Earnings Per Common Share — Basic and Diluted —Basic net income per common share represents net income attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per common share represents net income attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period and any dilutive common share equivalents, including (A) shares issuable upon the vesting of RSUs and exercise of stock options and (B) shares expected to be earned upon the achievement of the parameters established for PSUs, each to the extent not anti-dilutive. The Company uses the treasury stock method to calculate the effect of its outstanding RSUs, PSUs and stock options. Retirement Plan —The Company has a 401(k) plan covering substantially all employees who meet certain age and employment requirements. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company matched 100 % of the first 5 % of a participant's contributions. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company contributed $ 13.2 million, $ 11.8 million and $ 11.2 million to the plan, respectively. Accounting Standards Updates In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued guidance that modifies how entities measure credit losses on most financial instruments. The new guidance replaces the current ""incurred loss"" model with an ""expected credit loss"" model that requires consideration of a broader range of information to estimate expected credit losses over the lifetime of the asset. Operating lease receivables are not within the scope of this guidance. Effective January 1, 2020, the Company adopted the new guidance using the modified retrospective approach. There was no cumulative-effect adjustment to Distributions in excess of earnings on the consolidated balance sheet as of the effective date. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements. Results for reporting periods beginning January 1, 2020 are F-17 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) presented under the new standard, while prior-period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with accounting under the previously applicable guidance. In January 2017, the FASB issued guidance on accounting for goodwill impairments. The guidance eliminates Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test and requires, among other things, recognition of an impairment loss when the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. The loss recognized is limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Effective January 1, 2020, the Company adopted the new guidance on a prospective basis. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements. In March 2020, the FASB issued guidance to provide optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The guidance applies only to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. The expedients and exceptions provided by the guidance do not apply to contract modifications made and hedging relationships entered into or evaluated after December 31, 2022, except for hedging relationships existing as of December 31, 2022 for which an entity has elected certain optional expedients that are retained through the end of the hedging relationship. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has not modified any contracts as a result of reference rate reform and is evaluating the impact this standard may have on its financial statements. In April 2020, the FASB issued guidance on the application of lease accounting guidance to lease concessions provided as a result of the coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic (the “Lease Modification Q&A”). Under existing guidance, a Company must determine, on a lease by lease basis, if a concession was (i) the result of a new lease agreement and as such treated within the lease modification accounting framework or (ii) under the enforceable rights and obligations within the existing lease agreement and as such precluded from applying the lease modification accounting framework. The Lease Modification Q&A provides an optional exception that allows a Company, if certain criteria have been met, to bypass the lease by lease analysis, and instead elect to either apply the lease modification accounting framework or not, provided that the election is applied consistently to leases with similar characteristics and circumstances. The Company evaluated the impact this guidance may have on its financial statements and has elected to not bypass the lease by lease analysis. 2.

LEASES The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at the inception of the agreement. The Company considers an arrangement to be a lease if it conveys the right to control the use of the communications site or ground space underneath a communications site for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The Company is both a lessor and a lessee. Lessor —The Company is a lessor in most of its revenue arrangements, as property revenue is derived from tenant leases of specifically-identified, physically distinct space on the Company’s communications real estate assets. The Company’s lease arrangements with its tenants vary depending upon the region and the industry of the tenant and generally have initial non-cancellable terms of five to ten years with multiple renewal terms. The leases also contain provisions that periodically increase the rent due, typically annually, based on a fixed escalation percentage or an inflationary index, or a combination of both. The Company structures its leases to include financial penalties if a tenant terminates the lease, which serve to disincentivize tenants from terminating the lease prior to the expiration of the lease term. The Company’s leasing arrangements outside of the U.S. may require that the Company provide power to the communications site through an electrical grid connection, diesel fuel generators or other sources and permit the Company to pass through the costs of, or otherwise charge for, these services. Many arrangements require that the communications site has power for a specified percentage of time. In most cases, if delivery of power falls below the specified service level, a corresponding reduction in revenue is recorded. The Company has determined that this performance obligation is satisfied over time for the duration of the lease. The Company typically has more than one tenant on a site and, by performing ordinary course repair and maintenance work, can often lease a site, either through renewing existing agreements or leasing to new tenants, for periods beyond the existing tenant lease term. Accordingly, the Company has minimal risk with respect to the residual value of its leased assets. Communications sites are depreciated over their estimated useful lives, which generally do not exceed twenty years . As of December 31, 2020, the Company does not have any material related party leases as a lessor. The Company generally does not enter into sales-type leases or direct financing leases. The Company’s leases generally do not include any incentives F-19 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) for the lessee, however, if incentives are present, they are evaluated to determine proper treatment. In addition, the Company’s leases do not include any lessee purchase options. Historically, the Company has been able to successfully renew its ground leases as needed to ensure continuation of its tower revenue. Accordingly, the Company assumes that it will have access to the land underneath its tower sites when calculating future minimum rental receipts. Future minimum rental receipts expected under non-cancellable operating lease agreements as of December 31, 2020, were as follows: Year Ended December 31, Amount (1) 2021 $ 6,194.6 2022 5,905.5 2023 5,779.5 2024 5,618.8 2025 5,410.6 Thereafter 29,660.9 Total $ 58,569.9 _______________ (1) Balances are translated at the applicable period-end exchange rate, which may impact comparability between periods. Lessee —The Company enters into arrangements as a lessee primarily for ground space underneath its communications sites. These arrangements are typically long-term lease agreements with initial non-cancellable terms of approximately five to ten years with one or more automatic or exercisable renewal periods and specified increases in lease payments upon exercise of the renewal options. The Company typically exercises its ground lease renewal options in order to provide ongoing tenant space on its communications sites through the end of the tenant lease term. Escalation clauses present in operating leases, excluding those tied to CPI or other inflation-based indices, are recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated lease term of the applicable lease as a component of rent expense. Additionally, the escalations tied to CPI or another inflation-based index are considered variable lease payments. In certain circumstances, the Company enters into revenue sharing arrangements with the ground space owner, which results in variability in lease payments. In most markets outside of the U.S., in the event there are no tenants on the communications site, the Company generally has unilateral termination rights and in certain situations, the lease is structured to allow for termination by the Company with minimal or no penalties. Ground lease arrangements usually include annual escalations and do not contain any residual value guarantees or restrictions on dividends, other financial obligations or other similar terms. The Company has entered into certain transactions whereby at the end of a lease, sublease or similar arrangement, the Company has the option to purchase the corresponding communications sites. These transactions are further described in note 19. The Company’s lease liability is the present value of the remaining minimum rental payments to be made over the remaining lease term, including renewal options reasonably certain to be exercised. The Company also considers termination options and factors those into the determination of lease payments when appropriate. To determine the lease term, the Company considers all renewal periods that are reasonably certain to be exercised, taking into consideration all economic factors, including the communications site’s estimated economic life (generally 20 years) and the respective lease terms of the Company’s tenants under the existing lease arrangements on such site. The Company assesses its right-of-use asset and other lease-related assets for impairment, as described in note 1. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded $ 76.1 million and $ 9.9 million, respectively, of impairment expense related to these assets. As of December 31, 2020, the Company does not have any material related party leases as a lessee. The Company does not have any sale-leaseback arrangements as lessee and typically does not enter into leveraged leases. The Company leases certain land and office space under operating leases and land and improvements, towers and vehicles under finance leases. As of December 31, 2020, operating lease assets were included in Right-of-use asset and finance lease assets were included in Property and equipment, net in the consolidated balance sheet. F-20 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) Information about other lease-related balances is as follows: As of December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Operating leases: Right-of-use asset $ 7,789.2 $ 7,357.4 Current portion of lease liability $ 539.9 $ 494.5 Lease liability 6,884.4 6,510.4 Total operating lease liability $ 7,424.3 $ 7,004.9 Finance leases: Current portion of lease liability $ 4.9 $ 6.7 Lease liability 23.0 24.0 Total finance lease liability $ 27.9 $ 30.7 As most of the Company’s leases do not specifically state an implicit rate, the Company uses a market-specific incremental borrowing rate consistent with the lease term as of the lease commencement date or upon a remeasurement event when calculating the present value of the remaining lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate reflects the cost to borrow on a securitized basis in each market. The remaining lease term does not reflect all renewal options available to the Company, only those renewal options that the Company has assessed as reasonably certain of being exercised taking into consideration the economic and other factors noted above. The weighted-average remaining lease terms and incremental borrowing rates are as follows: As of December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Operating leases: Weighted-average remaining lease term (years) 13.7 13.1 Weighted-average incremental borrowing rate 5.6 % 6.1 % Finance leases: Weighted-average remaining lease term (years) 12.1 15.0 Weighted-average incremental borrowing rate 6.8 % 6.2 % The following table sets forth the components of lease cost: Year ended December 31, 2020 Year ended December 31, 2019 Operating lease cost $ 977.2 $ 1,013.1 Variable lease costs not included in lease liability (1) 280.0 261.7 _______________ (1) Includes property tax paid on behalf of the landlord. The interest expense on finance lease liabilities was $ 1.3 million and $ 1.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Assets held under finance leases are recorded in property and equipment and are depreciated over the lesser of the remaining lease term or the remaining useful life.

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS The changes in the carrying value of goodwill for each of the Company’s business segments were as follows: Property Services Total U.S. & Canada Asia-Pacific Africa Europe Latin America Balance as of December 31, 2018 $ 3,382.5 $ 1,045.5 $ 119.3 $ 262.0 $ 690.6 $ 2.0 $ 5,501.9 Additions and adjustments (1) 32.8 — 670.0 — — — 702.8 Effect of foreign currency translation — ( 23.7 ) 0.9 ( 5.8 ) 2.2 — ( 26.4 ) Balance as of December 31, 2019 $ 3,415.3 $ 1,021.8 $ 790.2 $ 256.2 $ 692.8 $ 2.0 $ 6,178.3 Additions and adjustments (2) 1,335.5 18.7 ( 153.6 ) — — — 1,200.6 Effect of foreign currency translation — ( 23.6 ) ( 11.0 ) 22.9 ( 84.5 ) — ( 96.2 ) Balance as of December 31, 2020 $ 4,750.8 $ 1,016.9 $ 625.6 $ 279.1 $ 608.3 $ 2.0 $ 7,282.7 _______________ (1) Additions consist of $ 704.3 million resulting from 2019 acquisitions, partially offset by $ 1.5 million from revisions to prior-year acquisitions due to measurement period adjustments. (2) U.S. & Canada and Asia-Pacific consist of an aggregate of $ 1,354.2 million of additions related to the InSite Acquisition. Africa consists of measurement period adjustments related to the Eaton Towers Acquisition (as defined in note 7). F-22 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) The Company’s other intangible assets subject to amortization consisted of the following: As of December 31, 2020 As of December 31, 2019 Estimated Useful Lives (years) Gross Carrying Value Accumulated Amortization Net Book Value Gross Carrying Value Accumulated Amortization Net Book Value Acquired network location intangibles (1) Up to 20 $ 5,784.0 $ ( 2,117.6 ) $ 3,666.4 $ 5,150.8 $ ( 1,920.4 ) $ 3,230.4 Acquired tenant-related intangibles Up to 20 14,322.5 ( 4,237.5 ) 10,085.0 12,674.1 ( 3,674.6 ) 8,999.5 Acquired licenses and other intangibles 3 - 20 97.8 ( 9.4 ) 88.4 106.7 ( 18.2 ) 88.5 Total other intangible assets $ 20,204.3 $ ( 6,364.5 ) $ 13,839.8 $ 17,931.6 $ ( 5,613.2 ) $ 12,318.4 _______________ (1) Acquired network location intangibles are amortized over the shorter of the term of the corresponding ground lease, taking into consideration lease renewal options and residual value, generally up to 20 years, as the Company considers these intangibles to be directly related to the tower assets. The acquired network location intangibles represent the value to the Company of the incremental revenue growth that could potentially be obtained from leasing the excess capacity on acquired communications sites. The acquired tenant-related intangibles typically represent the value to the Company of tenant contracts and relationships in place at the time of an acquisition or similar transaction, including assumptions regarding estimated renewals. The Company amortizes its acquired network location intangibles and tenant-related intangibles on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. As of December 31, 2020, the remaining weighted average amortization period of the Company’s intangible assets was 15 years. Amortization of intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $ 867.2 million, $ 791.3 million and $ 1,144.1 million, respectively. Amortization expense decreased for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, because in 2018, the Company entered into agreements with one of its tenants in India, Tata Teleservices Limited (“Tata Teleservices”) and related entities (collectively, “Tata”), for a settlement and release of certain contractual lease obligations of Tata Teleservices. As a result, the Company recorded $ 327.5 million of accelerated amortization related to the Tata tenant relationship in 2018, which was subsequently retired. Based on current exchange rates, the Company expects to record amortization expense as follows over the next five years: Fiscal Year Amount 2021 $ 999.6 2022 994.0 2023 969.0 2024 959.1 2025 927.6 6. NOTES RECEIVABLE AND OTHER NON-CURRENT ASSETS Notes receivable and other non-current assets consisted of the following: As of December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Notes receivable $ 6.5 $ 1.1 Other miscellaneous assets 393.6 405.3 Notes receivable and other non-current assets $ 400.1 $ 406.4 7. ACQUISITIONS The Company evaluates each of its acquisitions under the accounting guidance framework to determine whether to treat an acquisition as an asset acquisition or a business combination. For those transactions treated as asset acquisitions, the purchase price is allocated to the assets or rights acquired and liabilities assumed, with no recognition of goodwill. For those transactions treated as business combinations, the estimates of the fair value of the assets or rights acquired and liabilities assumed at the F-23 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) date of the applicable acquisition are subject to adjustment during the measurement period (up to one year from the particular acquisition date). The primary areas of the accounting for the acquisitions that are not yet finalized relate to the fair value of certain tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including tax positions, which may include contingent consideration, residual goodwill and any related tax impact. The fair value of these net assets acquired are based on management’s estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. While the Company believes that such preliminary estimates provide a reasonable basis for estimating the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, it evaluates any necessary information prior to finalization of the fair value. During the measurement period for those acquisitions accounted for as business combinations, the Company will adjust assets or liabilities if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have resulted in the revised estimated values of those assets or liabilities as of that date. Impact of current year acquisitions —The Company typically acquires communications sites and other communications infrastructure assets from wireless carriers or other tower operators and subsequently integrates those sites and related assets into its existing portfolio of communications sites and related assets. The financial results of the Company’s acquisitions have been included in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 from the date of the respective acquisition. The date of acquisition, and by extension the point at which the Company begins to recognize the results of an acquisition, may depend on, among other things, the receipt of contractual consents, the commencement and extent of leasing arrangements and the timing of the transfer of title or rights to the assets, which may be accomplished in phases. Sites acquired from communications service providers may never have been operated as a business and may instead have been utilized solely by the seller as a component of its network infrastructure. An acquisition may or may not involve the transfer of business operations or employees. For those acquisitions accounted for as business combinations, the Company recognizes acquisition and merger related expenses in the period in which they are incurred and services are received; for transactions accounted for as asset acquisitions, these costs are capitalized as part of the purchase price. Acquisition and merger related costs may include finder’s fees, advisory, legal, accounting, valuation and other professional or consulting fees and general administrative costs directly related to completing the transaction. Integration costs include incremental and non-recurring costs necessary to convert data, retain employees and otherwise enable the Company to operate acquired businesses or assets efficiently. The Company records acquisition and merger related expenses for business combinations, as well as integration costs for all acquisitions, in Other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company recorded acquisition and merger related expenses for business combinations and non-capitalized asset acquisition costs and integration costs as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 Acquisition and merger related expenses $ 15.5 $ 26.9 $ 14.1 Integration costs $ 23.1 $ 9.8 $ 16.1 During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded net benefits of $ 4.4 million and $ 13.1 million related to pre-acquisition contingencies and settlements, respectively. 2020 Transactions The estimated aggregate impact of the acquisitions completed in 2020 on the Company’s revenues and gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2020 was approximately $ 14.9 million and $ 10.5 million, respectively. The revenues and gross margin amounts also reflect incremental revenues from the addition of new tenants to such sites subsequent to the transaction date. Acquisitions completed in 2020 were included in all of the Company’s property segments. InSite Acquisition —On December 23, 2020, the Company acquired 100 % of the outstanding units of IWG Holdings, LLC, the parent company of InSite, which owned, operated and managed approximately 3,000 communications sites in the U.S. and Canada. The portfolio includes approximately 1,400 owned towers in the United States, over 200 owned towers in Canada and approximately 40 DAS networks in the United States. In addition, the portfolio includes more than 600 land parcels under communications sites in the United States, Canada and Australia, as well as approximately 400 rooftop sites. The acquired U.S. and Canada assets and operations are included in the U.S. & Canada property segment and the acquired Australian assets and operations are included in the Asia-Pacific property segment. The total consideration for the InSite Acquisition, including cash acquired, the repayment and assumption of certain debt held by InSite, was approximately $ 3.5 billion, subject to certain F-24 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) closing adjustments. The InSite Acquisition was accounted for as a business combination and is subject to post-closing adjustments. Entel Acquisition —On December 19, 2019, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire approximately 3,200 communications sites in Chile and Peru from Entel PCS Telecomunicaciones S.A. and Entel Peru S.A. (“Entel”) for total consideration of approximately $ 0.8 billion (as of the date of signing). The Company completed the acquisition of approximately 2,400 communications sites in December 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of an additional 530 communications sites pursuant to this agreement for an aggregate total purchase price of $ 137.7 million (as of the dates of acquisition), including value added tax. This acquisition is being accounted for as an acquisition of assets and is included in the table below in “Other.” The remaining communications sites are expected to continue to close in tranches, subject to certain closing conditions. Poland Acquisition —On June 16, 2020, the Company, through its Polish subsidiary, entered into a definitive agreement with Electronic Control Systems Spółka Akcyjna to acquire up to 50 communications sites in Poland for total consideration of 18.3 million Polish Zloty (“PLN”) ($ 4.6 million at the date of signing). During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of 27 of these communications sites for total consideration of 12.1 million PLN ($ 3.1 million as of the dates of acquisition), including value added tax. This acquisition is being accounted for as an acquisition of assets and is included in the table below in “Other.” The remaining communications sites are expected to continue to close in tranches, subject to customary closing conditions. Other Acquisitions— During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company acquired a total of 1,299 communications sites, as well as other communications infrastructure assets, in the United States, France, Mexico, Peru and South Africa, including 564 sites in connection with the Company’s agreements with Orange S.A. (“Orange”) as further described below, for an aggregate purchase price of $ 978.0 million. Of the aggregate purchase price, $ 58.9 million is reflected as a payable in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020. The majority of these acquisitions were accounted for as asset acquisitions and are included in the table below in “Other.” The following table summarizes the allocations of the purchase prices for the fiscal year 2020 acquisitions based upon their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition: InSite Acquisition Other (1) Current assets $ 57.2 $ 40.6 Property and equipment 516.4 336.7 Intangible assets (2): Tenant-related intangible assets 1,160.1 596.5 Network location intangible assets 622.7 166.6 Other intangible assets — 1.3 Other non-current assets 300.7 112.3 Current liabilities ( 75.9 ) ( 10.9 ) Deferred tax liability ( 116.3 ) ( 9.8 ) Other non-current liabilities ( 267.6 ) ( 114.5 ) Net assets acquired 2,197.3 1,118.8 Goodwill (3) 1,354.2 — Fair value of net assets acquired 3,551.5 1,118.8 Debt assumed (4) ( 800.0 ) — Purchase price $ 2,751.5 $ 1,118.8 ______________ (1) Includes 25 sites in Peru held pursuant to long-term finance leases. (2) Tenant-related intangible assets and network location intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis generally over a 20 year period. (3) The Company expects goodwill to be partially deductible for tax purposes. (4) InSite Acquisition debt assumed includes $ 763.5 million of InSite’s indebtedness and a fair value adjustment of $ 36.5 million.

In addition, if the Company undergoes a change F-32 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) of control and corresponding ratings decline, each as defined in the applicable supplemental indenture, it may be required to repurchase all of the applicable notes at a purchase price equal to 101 % of the principal amount of such notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest (including additional interest, if any), up to but not including the repurchase date. The Notes rank equally with all of the Company’s other senior unsecured debt and are structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of its subsidiaries. Each applicable supplemental indenture for the Notes contains certain covenants that restrict the Company’s ability to merge, consolidate or sell assets and its (together with its subsidiaries’) ability to incur liens. These covenants are subject to a number of exceptions, including that the Company and its subsidiaries may incur certain liens on assets, mortgages or other liens securing indebtedness if the aggregate amount of indebtedness secured by such liens does not exceed 3.5 x Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the applicable supplemental indenture. As of December 31, 2020, the Company was in compliance with each of these covenants. American Tower Subsidiary Debt Securitizations The Company has several securitizations in place. Cash flows generated by the sites that secure the securitized debt are only available for payment of such debt and are not available to pay the Company’s other obligations or the claims of its creditors. However, subject to certain restrictions, the Company holds the right to receive the excess cash flows not needed to pay the securitized debt and other obligations arising out of the securitizations. The securitized debt is the obligation of the issuers thereof or borrowers thereunder, as applicable, and their subsidiaries, and not of the Company or its other subsidiaries. American Tower Secured Revenue Notes, Series 2015-1, Class A and Series 2015-2, Class A —In May 2015, GTP Acquisition Partners I, LLC (“GTP Acquisition Partners”), one of the Company’s wholly owned subsidiaries, refinanced existing debt with cash on hand and proceeds from a private issuance (the “2015 Securitization”) of $ 350.0 million of American Tower Secured Revenue Notes, Series 2015-1, Class A (the “Series 2015-1 Notes”) and $ 525.0 million of American Tower Secured Revenue Notes, Series 2015-2, Class A (the “Series 2015-2 Notes,” and together with the Series 2015-1 Notes, the “2015 Notes”). The 2015 Notes were issued by GTP Acquisition Partners pursuant to a Third Amended and Restated Indenture and related series supplements, each dated as of May 29, 2015 (collectively, the “2015 Indenture”), between GTP Acquisition Partners and its subsidiaries (the “GTP Entities”) and The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee. The effective weighted average life and interest rate of the 2015 Notes was 8.1 years and 3.029 %, respectively, as of the date of issuance. Repayment of Series 2015-1 Notes —On the June 2020 payment date, the Company repaid the entire $ 350.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Series 2015-1 Notes, pursuant to the terms of the agreements governing such securities. The repayment was funded with cash on hand. The outstanding Series 2015-2 Notes are secured by (i) mortgages, deeds of trust and deeds to secure debt on substantially all of the 3,538 communications sites (the “2015 Secured Sites”) owned by the GTP Entities and their operating cash flows, (ii) a security interest in substantially all of the personal property and fixtures of the GTP Entities, including GTP Acquisition Partners’ equity interests in its subsidiaries and (iii) the rights of the GTP Entities under a management agreement. American Tower Holding Sub II, LLC, whose only material assets are its equity interests in GTP Acquisition Partners, has guaranteed repayment of the Series 2015-2 Notes and pledged its equity interests in GTP Acquisition Partners as security for such payment obligations. Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2013-2A , Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2018-1, Subclass A and Series 2018-1, Subclass R —On March 29, 2018, the Company completed a securitization transaction (the “2018 Securitization”), in which the American Tower Trust I (the “Trust”) issued $ 500.0 million aggregate principal amount of Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2018-1, Subclass A (the “Series 2018-1A Securities”). To satisfy the applicable risk retention requirements of Regulation RR promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act” and, such requirements, the “Risk Retention Rules”), the Trust issued, and one of the Company’s affiliates purchased, $ 26.4 million aggregate principal amount of Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2018-1, Subclass R (the “Series 2018-1R Securities” and, together with the Series 2018-1A Securities, the “2018 Securities”) to retain an “eligible horizontal residual interest” (as defined in the Risk Retention Rules) in an amount equal to at least 5% of the fair value of the 2018 Securities. The Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2013-2A (the “Series 2013-2A Securities” and, together with the 2018 Securities the “Trust Securities”) issued in a securitization transaction in March 2013 (the “2013 Securitization” and, together with the 2018 Securitization, the “Trust Securitizations”) remain outstanding and are subject to the terms of the Second Amended and Restated Trust and Servicing Agreement entered into in connection with the 2018 Securitization. F-33 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) The assets of the Trust consist of a nonrecourse loan (the “Loan”) made by the Trust to American Tower Asset Sub, LLC and American Tower Asset Sub II, LLC (together, the “AMT Asset Subs”). The AMT Asset Subs are jointly and severally liable under the Loan, which is secured primarily by mortgages on the AMT Asset Subs’ interests in 5,114 broadcast and wireless communications towers and related assets (the “Trust Sites”). The component of the Loan corresponding to the Series 2013-2A Securities also remains outstanding and is subject to the terms of the Second Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement among the Trust and the AMT Asset Subs, dated as of March 29, 2018 (the “Loan Agreement”). The Loan Agreement includes terms and conditions, including with respect to secured assets, substantially consistent with the First Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement dated as of March 15, 2013. The 2018 Securities correspond to components of the Loan made to the AMT Asset Subs pursuant to the Loan Agreement and were issued in two separate subclasses of the same series. The 2018 Securities represent a pass-through interest in the components of the Loan corresponding to the 2018 Securities. The Series 2018-1A Securities have an interest rate of 3.652 % and the Series 2018-1R Securities have an interest rate of 4.459 %. The 2018 Securities have an expected life of approximately ten years with a final repayment date in March 2048. Subject to certain limited exceptions described below, no payments of principal will be required to be made on the components of the Loan corresponding to the 2018 Securities prior to the monthly payment date in March 2028, which is the anticipated repayment date for such components. The Loan is secured by (1) mortgages, deeds of trust and deeds to secure debt on substantially all of the Trust Sites and their operating cash flows, (2) a security interest in substantially all of the AMT Asset Subs’ personal property and fixtures and (3) the AMT Asset Subs’ rights under that certain management agreement among the AMT Asset Subs and SpectraSite Communications, LLC entered into in March 2013. American Tower Holding Sub, LLC (the “Guarantor”), whose only material assets are its equity interests in each of the AMT Asset Subs, and American Tower Guarantor Sub, LLC whose only material asset is its equity interests in the Guarantor, have each guaranteed repayment of the Loan and pledged their equity interests in their respective subsidiary or subsidiaries as security for such payment obligations. Under the terms of the Loan Agreement and the 2015 Indenture, amounts due will be paid from the cash flows generated by the Trust Sites or the 2015 Secured Sites, respectively, which must be deposited into certain reserve accounts, and thereafter distributed solely pursuant to the terms of the Loan Agreement or 2015 Indenture, as applicable. On a monthly basis, after payment of all required amounts under the Loan Agreement or 2015 Indenture, as applicable, including interest payments, subject to the conditions described below, the excess cash flows generated from the operation of such assets are released to the AMT Asset Subs or GTP Acquisition Partners, as applicable, which can then be distributed to, and used by, the Company. In order to distribute any excess cash flow to the Company, the AMT Asset Subs and GTP Acquisition Partners must each maintain a specified debt service coverage ratio (the “DSCR”), which is generally calculated as the ratio of the net cash flow (as defined in the applicable agreement) to the amount of interest, servicing fees and trustee fees required to be paid over the succeeding 12 months on the principal amount of the Loan or the 2015 Notes, as applicable, that will be outstanding on the payment date following such date of determination. If the DSCR were equal to or below 1.30 x (the “Cash Trap DSCR”) for any quarter, then all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments, fund required reserves, pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and make other payments required under the applicable transaction documents, referred to as excess cash flow, will be deposited into a reserve account (the “Cash Trap Reserve Account”) instead of being released to the AMT Asset Subs or GTP Acquisition Partners, as applicable. The funds in the Cash Trap Reserve Account will not be released to the AMT Asset Subs or GTP Acquisition Partners, as applicable, unless the DSCR exceeds the Cash Trap DSCR for two consecutive calendar quarters. Additionally, an “amortization period” commences if, as of the end of any calendar quarter, the DSCR is equal to or below 1.15 x (the “Minimum DSCR”) and will continue to exist until the DSCR exceeds the Minimum DSCR for two consecutive calendar quarters. With respect to the Trust Securities, an “amortization period” also commences if, on the anticipated repayment date the component of the Loan corresponding to the applicable subclass of the Trust Securities has not been repaid in full, provided that such amortization period shall apply with respect to such component that has not been repaid in full. If the Series 2015-2 Notes have not been repaid in full on the applicable anticipated repayment date, additional interest will accrue on the unpaid principal balance of the Series 2015-2 Notes, and such notes will begin to amortize on a monthly basis from excess cash flow. During an amortization period, all excess cash flow and any amounts in the applicable Cash Trap Reserve Account would be applied to pay the principal of the Loan or the Series 2015-2 Notes, as applicable, on each monthly payment date. The Loan and the Series 2015-2 Notes may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time, provided such payment is accompanied by the applicable prepayment consideration. If the prepayment occurs within 18 months of the anticipated repayment date with respect to the Series 2013-2A Securities or the Series 2015-2 Notes, or 36 months of the anticipated repayment date with respect to the Series 2018 Securities, no prepayment consideration is due. F-34 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) The Loan Agreement and the 2015 Indenture include operating covenants and other restrictions customary for transactions subject to rated securitizations. Among other things, the AMT Asset Subs and the GTP Entities, as applicable, are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets subject to customary carve-outs for ordinary course trade payables and permitted encumbrances (as defined in the Loan Agreement or the 2015 Indenture, as applicable). The organizational documents of the AMT Asset Subs and the GTP Entities contain provisions consistent with rating agency securitization criteria for special purpose entities, including the requirement that they maintain independent directors. The Loan Agreement and the 2015 Indenture also contain certain covenants that require the AMT Asset Subs or GTP Acquisition Partners, as applicable, to provide the respective trustee with regular financial reports and operating budgets, promptly notify such trustee of events of default and material breaches under the Loan Agreement and other agreements related to the Trust Sites or the 2015 Indenture and other agreements related to the 2015 Secured Sites, as applicable, and allow the applicable trustee reasonable access to the sites, including the right to conduct site investigations. A failure to comply with the covenants in the Loan Agreement or the 2015 Indenture could prevent the AMT Asset Subs or GTP Acquisition Partners, as applicable, from distributing excess cash flow to the Company. Furthermore, if the AMT Asset Subs or GTP Acquisition Partners were to default on the Loan or the Series 2015-2 Notes, the applicable trustee may seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of all or any portion of the Trust Sites or the 2015 Secured Sites, respectively, in which case the Company could lose the revenue associated with those assets. With respect to the Series 2015-2 Notes, upon the occurrence and during an event of default, the applicable trustee may, in its discretion or at the direction of holders of more than 50 % of the aggregate outstanding principal of the Series 2015-2 Notes, declare such notes immediately due and payable, in which case any excess cash flow would need to be used to pay holders of such notes. Further, under the Loan Agreement and the 2015 Indenture, the AMT Asset Subs or GTP Acquisition Partners, respectively, are required to maintain reserve accounts, including for ground rents, real estate and personal property taxes and insurance premiums, and, under the 2015 Indenture and in certain circumstances under the Loan Agreement, to reserve a portion of advance rents from tenants on the Trust Sites. Based on the terms of the Loan Agreement and the 2015 Indenture, all rental cash receipts received for each month are reserved for the succeeding month and held in an account controlled by the applicable trustee and then released. The $ 69.8 million held in the reserve accounts with respect to the Trust Securitizations and the $ 11.2 million held in the reserve accounts with respect to the 2015 Securitization as of December 31, 2020 are classified as Restricted cash on the Company’s accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

The Colombian Credit Facility may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time, subject to certain limitations and prepayment consideration. The Colombian Credit Facility is secured by, among other things, liens on towers owned by the applicable borrower. Each of the agreements governing the other subsidiary debt contains contractual covenants and other restrictions.

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS The changes in the carrying amount of the Company’s asset retirement obligations were as follows: 2020 2019 Beginning balance as of January 1, $ 1,384.1 $ 1,210.0 Additions 94.2 61.8 Accretion expense 90.8 81.6 Revisions in estimates (1) 8.3 56.8 Settlements ( 6.1 ) ( 26.1 ) Balance as of December 31, $ 1,571.3 $ 1,384.1 _______________ (1) Revisions in estimates include decreases to the liability of $ 42.1 million and $ 6.7 million related to foreign currency translation for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, the estimated undiscounted future cash outlay for asset retirement obligations was $ 3.7 billion. 12. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS The Company determines the fair value of its financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Below are the three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date. Level 2 Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Items Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis — The fair values of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities that are required to be measured on a recurring basis at fair value were as follows: December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Fair Value Measurements Using Fair Value Measurements Using Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Assets: Interest rate swap agreements — $ 29.2 — — $ 9.0 — Embedded derivative in lease agreement — — — — — $ 10.7 Liabilities: Interest rate swap agreements — $ 0.1 — — $ 7.5 — Fair value of debt related to interest rate swap agreements (1) $ 31.4 — — $ 3.3 — — _______________ (1) Included in the carrying values of the corresponding debt obligations. Interest Rate Swap Agreements The fair value of the Company’s interest rate swap agreements is determined using pricing models with inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, changes in the value of the derivatives are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in the current period, along with the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the Company records the change in fair value for the effective portion of the cash flow hedges in AOCL in the consolidated balance sheets and reclassifies a portion of the value from AOCL into Interest expense on a quarterly basis as the cash flows from the hedged item F-38 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) affects earnings. The Company records the settlement of interest rate swap agreements in (Loss) gain on retirement of long-term obligations in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the settlement occurs. The Company entered into three interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional value of $ 500.0 million related to the 3.000 % senior unsecured notes due 2023 (the “ 3.000 % Notes”). These interest rate swaps, which were designated as fair value hedges at inception, were entered into to hedge against changes in fair value of the 3.000 % Notes resulting from changes in interest rates. The interest rate swap agreements require the Company to pay interest at a variable interest rate of one-month LIBOR plus applicable spreads and to receive fixed interest at a rate of 3.000 % through June 15, 2023. The Company entered into three interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional value of $ 600.0 million related to the 2.250 % senior unsecured notes due 2022 (the “ 2.250 % Notes”). These interest rate swaps, which were designated as fair value hedges at inception, were entered into to hedge against changes in fair value of the 2.250 % Notes resulting from changes in interest rates. The interest rate swap agreements require the Company to pay interest at a variable interest rate of one-month LIBOR plus applicable spreads and to receive fixed interest at a rate of 2.250 % through January 15, 2022. The fair value of the U.S. interest rate swap asset of $ 29.2 million was included in Other non-current assets on the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2020. The fair values of the U.S. interest rate swap asset of $ 9.0 million and U.S. interest rate swap liability of $ 7.4 million were included in Other non-current assets and Other non-current liabilities, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded net fair value adjustments of $ 0.4 million related to interest rate swaps and the change in fair value of debt due to interest rate swaps in Other expense in the consolidated statements of operations. One of the Company’s Colombian subsidiaries is party to an interest rate swap agreement with certain lenders under the Colombian Credit Facility (the “Colombia Interest Rate Swap”). The Colombia Interest Rate Swap, which was designated as a cash flow hedge at inception, was entered into to manage exposure to variability in interest rates on debt. The Colombia Interest Rate Swap requires the payment of a fixed interest rate of 5.37 % and pays variable interest at the three-month Inter-bank Rate through the earlier of termination of the underlying debt or April 24, 2021. As of December 31, 2020, the aggregate notional amount of the Colombia Interest Rate Swap was 30.0 billion COP ($ 8.7 million). The fair value of the Colombia Interest Rate Swap as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 was less than $ 0.1 million and $ 0.1 million, respectively, and was included in Other non-current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Embedded Derivative in Lease Agreement In connection with the acquisition of communications sites in Nigeria, the Company entered into a site lease agreement where a portion of the monthly rent to be received is escalated based on an index outside the lessor’s economic environment. The fair value of the portion of the lease tied to the U.S. CPI was $ 14.6 million at the date of acquisition and was recorded in Notes receivable and other non-current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded an adjustment to the embedded derivative of $ 10.2 million, which is included in Other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had no embedded derivatives outstanding. Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests The Company records the carrying amount of the redeemable noncontrolling interests as described in note 15. Items Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis Assets Held and Used —The Company’s long-lived assets are recorded at amortized cost and, if impaired, are adjusted to fair value using Level 3 inputs. During the year ended December 31, 2020, certain long-lived assets held and used with a carrying value of $ 24.1 billion were written down to their net realizable value as a result of an asset impairment charge of $ 222.8 million. During the year ended December 31, 2019, certain long-lived assets held and used with a carrying value of $ 22.4 billion were written down to their net realizable value as a result of an asset impairment charge of $ 94.2 million. The asset impairment charges are recorded in Other operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. These adjustments were determined by comparing the estimated fair value utilizing projected future discounted cash flows to be provided from the long-lived assets to the asset’s carrying value. There were no other items measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during the year ended December 31, 2020. Fair Value of Financial Instruments —The Company’s financial instruments for which the carrying value reasonably approximates fair value at December 31, 2020 and 2019 include cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable F-39 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) and accounts payable. The Company’s estimates of fair value of its long-term obligations, including the current portion, are based primarily upon reported market values. For long-term debt not actively traded, fair value is estimated using either indicative price quotes or a discounted cash flow analysis using rates for debt with similar terms and maturities. As of December 31, 2020, the carrying value and fair value of long-term obligations, including the current portion, were $ 29.3 billion and $ 31.4 billion, respectively, of which $ 24.0 billion was measured using Level 1 inputs and $ 7.4 billion was measured using Level 2 inputs. As of December 31, 2019, the carrying value and fair value of long-term obligations, including the current portion, were $ 24.1 billion and $ 25.0 billion, respectively, of which $ 17.5 billion was measured using Level 1 inputs and $ 7.5 billion was measured using Level 2 inputs. 13. INCOME TAXES Beginning in the taxable year ended December 31, 2012, the Company has filed, and intends to continue to file, U.S. federal income tax returns as a REIT, and its domestic TRSs filed, and intend to continue to file, separate tax returns as required. The Company also files tax returns in various states and countries. The Company’s state tax returns reflect different combinations of the Company’s subsidiaries and are dependent on the connection each subsidiary has with a particular state and form of organization. The following information pertains to the Company’s income taxes on a consolidated basis. The income tax provision from continuing operations consisted of the following: Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 Current: Federal $ 8.7 $ ( 1.7 ) $ ( 1.4 ) State ( 10.7 ) ( 5.0 ) ( 1.8 ) Foreign ( 150.1 ) ( 48.2 ) ( 189.7 ) Deferred: Federal ( 1.0 ) 1.4 4.0 State ( 1.0 ) 0.5 0.7 Foreign 24.5 53.2 298.3 Income tax (provision) benefit $ ( 129.6 ) $ 0.2 $ 110.1 The effective tax rate (“ETR”) on income from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the Company’s qualification for taxation as a REIT, as well as adjustments for state and foreign items. As a REIT, the Company may deduct earnings distributed to stockholders against the income generated by its REIT operations. In addition, the Company is able to offset certain income by utilizing its remaining NOLs, subject to specified limitations. In 2019, there was an income tax law change in India that allows companies to elect into an optional concessional tax regime. The new regime allows for a lower effective tax rate from approximately 35 % to approximately 25 % and no minimum alternative tax, while disallowing the benefit of the minimum alternative tax credits. As a result, the Company recorded a $ 113.0 million one-time tax benefit during the year ended December 31, 2019 arising from revaluing its net deferred tax liability. In 2018, the income tax benefit was attributable to impairment charges and accelerated amortization on intangible assets taken in India as well as a benefit of $ 85.7 million related to the restructuring of international operations in certain jurisdictions. These benefits were partially offset by the receipt of the payment related to the Tata settlement. F-40 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) Reconciliation between the U.S. statutory rate and the effective rate from continuing operations is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 Statutory tax rate 21 % 21 % 21 % Adjustment to reflect REIT status (1) ( 21 ) ( 21 ) ( 21 ) Foreign taxes 4 3 ( 8 ) Foreign withholding taxes 3 3 4 Uncertain tax positions 1 1 — Changes in tax laws — ( 6 ) — Impact from restructuring — ( 1 ) ( 6 ) Changes in valuation allowance ( 1 ) — — Effective tax rate 7 % ( 0 )% ( 10 ) % _______________ (1) As a result of the ability to utilize the dividends paid deduction to offset the Company’s REIT income and gains. The domestic and foreign components of income from continuing operations before income taxes are as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 United States $ 1,683.0 $ 1,527.0 $ 1,212.7 Foreign 138.1 389.4 ( 58.1 ) Total $ 1,821.1 $ 1,916.4 $ 1,154.6 The components of the net deferred tax asset and liability and related valuation allowance were as follows: December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Assets: Operating lease liability $ 837.1 $ 878.5 Net operating loss carryforwards 327.1 356.6 Accrued asset retirement obligations 187.8 174.9 Stock-based compensation 9.2 5.6 Unearned revenue 34.6 31.7 Unrealized loss on foreign currency 4.9 3.8 Other accruals and allowances 83.4 65.6 Nondeductible interest 60.9 15.9 Items not currently deductible and other 65.8 10.2 Liabilities: Depreciation and amortization ( 1,140.3 ) ( 1,040.3 ) Right-of-use asset ( 824.0 ) ( 865.1 ) Deferred rent ( 92.9 ) ( 79.7 ) Investment in affiliate (1) ( 60.4 ) — Other ( 1.1 ) — Subtotal ( 507.9 ) ( 442.3 ) Valuation allowance ( 228.5 ) ( 194.2 ) Net deferred tax liabilities $ ( 736.4 ) $ ( 636.5 ) _______________ (1) Includes basis difference associated with investment in subsidiary related to the InSite Acquisition. The Company provides valuation allowances if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management assesses the available evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable F-41 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets. Valuation allowances may be reversed if, based on changes in facts and circumstances, the net deferred tax assets have been determined to be realizable. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company has provided a valuation allowance of $ 228.5 million and $ 194.2 million, respectively, which primarily relates to foreign items. The increase in the valuation allowance for the year ending December 31, 2020 is due to uncertainty as to the timing of, and the Company’s ability to recover, net deferred tax assets in certain foreign operations in the foreseeable future, offset by reversals and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if objective evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight may be given to subjective evidence such as the Company’s projections for growth. A summary of the activity in the valuation allowance is as follows: 2020 2019 2018 Balance as of January 1, $ 194.2 $ 151.9 $ 142.0 Additions (1) 64.7 42.5 15.7 Usage, expiration and reversals ( 22.0 ) — — Foreign currency translation ( 8.4 ) ( 0.2 ) ( 5.8 ) Balance as of December 31, $ 228.5 $ 194.2 $ 151.9 _______________ (1) Includes net charges to expense and allowances established due to acquisition. The recoverability of the Company’s deferred tax assets has been assessed utilizing projections based on its current operations. Accordingly, the recoverability of the deferred tax assets is not dependent on material asset sales or other non-routine transactions. Based on its current outlook of future taxable income during the carryforward period, the Company believes that deferred tax assets, other than those for which a valuation allowance has been recorded, will be realized. At December 31, 2020, the Company had net federal, state and foreign operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income. If not utilized, the Company’s NOLs expire as follows: Years ended December 31, Federal State Foreign 2021 to 2025 $ 141.6 $ 180.2 $ 12.4 2026 to 2030 0.0 193.7 85.6 2031 to 2035 9.5 48.7 3.5 2036 to 2040 61.7 183.0 — Indefinite carryforward 142.1 47.7 679.5 Total $ 354.9 $ 653.3 $ 781.0 As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would impact the ETR, if recognized, is $ 105.9 million and $ 158.1 million, respectively. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits for the year ended December 31, 2020 includes additions to the Company’s existing tax positions of $ 26.2 million. The Company expects the unrecognized tax benefits to change over the next 12 months if certain tax matters ultimately settle with the applicable taxing jurisdiction during this timeframe, or if the applicable statute of limitations lapses. The impact of the amount of such changes to previously recorded uncertain tax positions could range from zero to $ 32.7 million. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits are as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 Balance at January 1 $ 175.6 $ 107.7 $ 116.7 Additions based on tax positions related to the current year 4.7 33.3 8.1 Additions and reductions for tax positions of prior years (1) ( 5.0 ) 37.5 0.3 Foreign currency ( 9.6 ) ( 1.6 ) ( 8.1 ) Reduction as a result of the lapse of statute of limitations ( 26.0 ) ( 1.3 ) ( 2.6 ) Reduction as a result of effective settlements ( 3.5 ) — ( 6.7 ) Balance at December 31 $ 136.2 $ 175.6 $ 107.7 _______________ F-42 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) (1) Year ended December 31, 2020 includes adjustments of $(21.0) million for positions related to the Eaton Towers Acquisition that were revised in connection with settlements or effective settlements. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the statute of limitations on certain unrecognized tax benefits lapsed and certain positions were effectively settled, including effective settlements and revisions of prior year positions related to the Eaton Towers Acquisition, which resulted in a decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $ 50.5 million. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the statute of limitations on certain unrecognized tax benefits lapsed and certain positions were effectively settled, which resulted in decreases of $ 2.5 million and $ 9.3 million, respectively, in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits. The Company recorded penalties and tax-related interest expense to the tax provision of $ 16.4 million, $ 10.3 million and $ 8.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In addition, due to the expiration of the statute of limitations in certain jurisdictions and certain positions that were effectively settled, the Company reduced its liability for penalties and income tax-related interest expense related to uncertain tax positions during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 by $ 4.8 million, $ 2.7 million and $ 16.2 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the total amount of accrued income tax-related interest and penalties included in the consolidated balance sheets were $ 34.4 million and $ 26.6 million, respectively. The Company has filed for prior taxable years, and for its taxable year ended December 31, 2020 will file, numerous consolidated and separate income tax returns, including U.S. federal and state tax returns and foreign tax returns. The Company is subject to examination in the U.S. and various state and foreign jurisdictions for certain tax years. As a result of the Company’s ability to carryforward federal, state and foreign NOLs, the applicable tax years generally remain open to examination several years after the applicable loss carryforwards have been used or have expired. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the tax jurisdictions resulting from these examinations. The Company believes that adequate provisions have been made for income taxes for all periods through December 31, 2020. 14. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION Summary of Stock-Based Compensation Plans —The Company maintains equity incentive plans that provide for the grant of stock-based awards to its directors, officers and employees. The 2007 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended (the “2007 Plan”), provides for the grant of non-qualified and incentive stock options, as well as restricted stock units, restricted stock and other stock-based awards. Exercise prices for non-qualified and incentive stock options are not less than the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. Equity awards typically vest ratably, generally over four years for RSUs and stock options and three years for PSUs. Stock options generally expire 10 years from the date of grant. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had the ability to grant stock-based awards with respect to an aggregate of 6.5 million shares of common stock under the 2007 Plan. In addition, the Company maintains an employee stock purchase plan (the “ESPP”) pursuant to which eligible employees may purchase shares of the Company’s common stock on the last day of each bi-annual offering period at a 15 % discount from the lower of the closing market value on the first or last day of such offering period. The offering periods run from June 1 through November 30 and from December 1 through May 31 of each year. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company recorded and capitalized the following stock-based compensation expenses: 2020 2019 2018 Stock-based compensation expense - Property $ 1.9 $ 1.8 $ 2.4 Stock-based compensation expense - Services 1.1 1.0 0.9 Stock-based compensation expense - SG&A 117.8 108.6 134.2 Total stock-based compensation expense $ 120.8 $ 111.4 $ 137.5 Stock-based compensation expense capitalized as property and equipment $ 1.7 $ 1.6 $ 2.0 Stock Options —There were no options granted during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. The fair values of previously granted stock options were estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model based on the assumptions at the date of grant. The intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $ 176.3 million, $ 145.5 million and $ 98.8 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock options was less than $ 0.1 million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of less than F-43 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) one year .

Vesting of RSUs is subject generally to the employee’s continued employment or death, disability or qualified retirement (each as defined in the applicable RSU award agreement). Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units— During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company’s Compensation Committee granted an aggregate of 110,925 PSUs (the “2020 PSUs”), 114,823 PSUs (the “2019 PSUs”) and 131,311 PSUs (the “2018 PSUs”), respectively, to its executive officers and established the performance metrics for these awards. Threshold, target and maximum parameters were established for the metrics for a three -year performance period with respect to each of the 2020 PSUs, the 2019 PSUs and the 2018 PSUs and will be used to calculate the number of shares that will be issuable when each award vests, which may range from zero to 200 % of the target amounts. At the end of each three -year performance period, the number of shares that vest will depend on the degree of achievement against the pre-established performance goals. PSUs will be paid out in common stock at the end of each performance period, subject generally to the executive’s continued employment or death, disability or qualified retirement (each as defined in the applicable PSU award agreement). PSUs will accrue dividend equivalents prior to vesting, which will be paid out only in respect of shares that actually vest. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded $ 20.9 million in stock-based compensation expense for equity awards in which the performance goals have been established and were probable of being achieved. The remaining unrecognized compensation expense related to these awards at December 31, 2020 was $ 4.3 million based on the Company’s current assessment of the probability of achieving the performance goals. The weighted-average period over which the cost will be recognized is approximately two years . 15. REDEEMABLE NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS India Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests —On April 21, 2016, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, ATC Asia Pacific Pte. Ltd., acquired a 51 % controlling ownership interest in ATC TIPL (formerly Viom), a telecommunications infrastructure company that owns and operates wireless communications towers and indoor DAS networks in India (the “Viom Acquisition”), which was subsequently merged with the Company’s existing India property operations. In connection with the Viom Acquisition, the Company, through one of its subsidiaries, entered into a shareholders agreement (the “Shareholders Agreement”) with Viom and the following remaining Viom shareholders: Tata Sons Limited (“Tata Sons”), Tata Teleservices, IDFC Private Equity Fund III (“IDFC”), Macquarie SBI Infrastructure Investments Pte Limited and SBI Macquarie Infrastructure Trust (together, “Macquarie,” and, collectively with Tata Sons, Tata Teleservices and IDFC, the “Remaining Shareholders”). The Shareholders Agreement also provides the Remaining Shareholders with put options, which allow them to sell outstanding shares of ATC TIPL to the Company, and the Company with call options, which allow it to buy the noncontrolling shares of ATC TIPL. The put options, which are not under the Company’s control, cannot be separated from the noncontrolling interests. As a result, the combination of the noncontrolling interests and the redemption feature requires classification as redeemable noncontrolling interests in the consolidated balance sheet, separate from equity. The noncontrolling interests become redeemable after the passage of time, and therefore, the Company records the carrying amount of the noncontrolling interests outside of permanent equity at the greater of (i) the initial carrying amount, increased or decreased for the noncontrolling interests’ share of net income or loss and foreign currency translation adjustments, or (ii) the F-45 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) estimated redemption value. If required, the Company will adjust the redeemable noncontrolling interests to the estimated redemption value on each balance sheet date with changes in the estimated redemption value recognized as an adjustment to Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. The Company adjusts the estimated redemption value of the noncontrolling interests based on the operating results of ATC TIPL and previously recorded adjustments to the estimated redemption value. The put options may be exercised, requiring the Company to purchase the Remaining Shareholders’ equity interests, on specified dates through March 31, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company redeemed 50 % of Tata Teleservices and Tata Sons’ combined holdings of ATC TIPL and 100 % of IDFC’s holdings of ATC TIPL, for total consideration of INR 29.4 billion ($ 425.7 million at the date of redemption). As a result of the redemption, the Company’s controlling interest in ATC TIPL increased from 63 % to 79 % and the noncontrolling interest decreased from 37 % to 21 %. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company redeemed 100 % of Tata Teleservices and Tata Sons’ remaining combined holdings of ATC TIPL, for total consideration of INR 24.8 billion ($ 337.3 million at the date of redemption). As a result of the redemption, the Company’s controlling interest in ATC TIPL increased from 79 % to 92 % and the noncontrolling interest decreased from 21 % to 8 %. In February 2021, the Company entered into an agreement with Macquarie to redeem 100 % of their combined holdings in ATC TIPL at price of INR 175 per share, subject to certain adjustments. Accordingly, the Company expects to pay an amount equivalent to INR 12.9 billion (approximately $ 176.6 million) to redeem the shares in 2021, subject to regulatory approval. After the completion of the redemption, the Company will hold a 100 % ownership interest in ATC TIPL. Other Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests —During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of MTN’s noncontrolling interests in each of the Company’s joint ventures in Ghana and Uganda for total consideration of approximately $ 524.4 million, including a net adjustment of $ 1.4 million made during the three months ended March 31, 2020, which resulted in an increase in the Company’s controlling interests in such joint ventures from 51 % to 100 %. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company, through a subsidiary of ATC Europe, entered into an agreement with its local partners in France to form Eure-et-Loir Réseaux Mobiles SAS (“Eure-et-Loir”), a telecommunications infrastructure company that owns and operates wireless communications towers in France. The Company’s controlling interest in Eure-et-Loir is 51 % with local partners holding a 49 % noncontrolling interest. The value of the Eure-et-Loir interests as of December 31, 2020 was $ 2.6 million. The changes in Redeemable noncontrolling interests for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 Balance as of January 1, $ 1,096.5 $ 1,004.8 $ 1,126.2 Additions to redeemable noncontrolling interests — 525.7 — Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests 6.6 35.8 ( 87.9 ) Adjustment to noncontrolling interest redemption value ( 14.0 ) ( 35.8 ) 86.7 Adjustment to noncontrolling interest due to merger — — ( 28.1 ) Purchase of redeemable noncontrolling interest ( 861.7 ) ( 425.7 ) — Foreign currency translation adjustment attributable to noncontrolling interests ( 15.3 ) ( 8.3 ) ( 92.1 ) Balance as of December 31, $ 212.1 $ 1,096.5 $ 1,004.8 16. EQUITY Dividends —The Company may pay dividends in cash or, subject to certain limitations, in shares of common stock or any combination of cash and shares of common stock.

During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company received an aggregate of $ 98.1 million in proceeds upon exercises of stock options and sales pursuant to the ESPP. F-46 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) 2020 “At the Market” Stock Offering Program —In August 2020, the Company established an “at the market” stock offering program through which it may issue and sell shares of its common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $ 1.0 billion (the “2020 ATM Program”). Sales under the 2020 ATM Program may be made by means of ordinary brokers’ transactions on the New York Stock Exchange or otherwise at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to prevailing market prices or, subject to specific instructions of the Company, at negotiated prices. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from any issuances under the 2020 ATM Program for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, the funding of acquisitions, additions to working capital and repayment or refinancing of existing indebtedness. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has not sold any shares of common stock under the 2020 ATM Program. Stock Repurchase Programs —In March 2011, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program, pursuant to which the Company is authorized to repurchase up to $ 1.5 billion of its common stock (the “2011 Buyback”). In December 2017, the Board of Directors approved an additional stock repurchase program, pursuant to which the Company is authorized to repurchase up to $ 2.0 billion of its common stock (the “2017 Buyback,” and, together with the 2011 Buyback, the “Buyback Programs”). During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company repurchased 264,086 shares of its common stock under the 2011 Buyback for an aggregate of $ 56.0 million, including commissions and fees. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had repurchased a total of 14,361,283 shares of its common stock under the 2011 Buyback for an aggregate of $ 1.5 billion, including commissions and fees. There were no repurchases under the 2017 Buyback. Under the Buyback Programs, the Company is authorized to purchase shares from time to time through open market purchases or in privately negotiated transactions not to exceed market prices and subject to market conditions and other factors. With respect to open market purchases, the Company may use plans adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act in accordance with securities laws and other legal requirements, which allows the Company to repurchase shares during periods when it may otherwise be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of self-imposed trading blackout periods. The Company expects to fund any further repurchases of its common stock through a combination of cash on hand, cash generated by operations and borrowings under its credit facilities. Repurchases under the Buyback Programs are subject to, among other things, the Company having available cash to fund the repurchases. Distributions — During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company declared the following cash distributions (per share data reflects actual amounts): For the year ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 Distribution per share Aggregate Payment Amount Distribution per share Aggregate Payment Amount Distribution per share Aggregate Payment Amount Common Stock $ 4.53 $ 2,010.7 $ 3.78 $ 1,672.8 $ 3.15 $ 1,389.8 Series B Preferred Stock (1) $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 13.75 $ 18.9 _______________ (1) 5.50 % Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, Series B, par value $ 0.01 per share (the “Series B Preferred Stock”), which converted into shares of the Company’s common stock pursuant to the provisions of the Certificate of Designations governing the Series B Preferred Stock in 2018.

To maintain its qualification for taxation as a REIT, the Company expects to continue paying distributions, the amount, timing and frequency of which will be determined, and subject to adjustment, by the Company’s Board of Directors. Dividend to noncontrolling interest — The Company’s joint ventures may, from time to time, declare dividends. During the year ended December 31, 2020, ATC Europe declared a dividend of EUR 13.2 million (approximately $ 16.2 million) payable in cash to the Company and PGGM in proportion to their respective equity interests in the joint venture on or before June 30, 2021 and is accrued for as of December 31, 2020. 17. OTHER OPERATING EXPENSE Other operating expense consists primarily of impairment charges, net losses on sales or disposals of assets and other operating expense items. The Company records impairment charges to write down certain assets to their net realizable value after an indicator of impairment is identified and subsequent analysis determines that the asset is either partially recoverable or not recoverable. These assets consisted primarily of towers and related assets, which are typically assessed on an individual basis, network location intangibles, which relate directly to towers, tenant-related intangibles, which are assessed on a tenant basis, and right-of-use assets. Net losses on sales or disposals of assets primarily relate to certain non-core towers, other assets and miscellaneous items. Other operating expenses includes acquisition-related costs and integration costs. Other operating expenses included the following for the years ended December 31,: 2020 (1) 2019 (2) 2018 Impairment charges $ 222.8 $ 94.2 $ 394.0 Net losses on sales or disposals of assets 17.3 45.1 85.6 Other operating expenses 25.7 27.0 33.7 Total Other operating expenses $ 265.8 $ 166.3 $ 513.3 _______________ (1) For the year ended December 31, 2020, Other operating expenses includes an $ 11.9 million benefit in Brazil.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Litigation —The Company periodically becomes involved in various claims, lawsuits and proceedings that are incidental to its business. In the opinion of Company management, after consultation with counsel, there are no matters currently pending that would, in the event of an adverse outcome, materially impact the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Verizon Transaction —In March 2015, the Company entered into an agreement with various operating entities of Verizon Communications Inc. (“Verizon”) that currently provides for the lease, sublease or management of approximately 11,250 wireless communications sites commencing March 27, 2015. The average term of the lease or sublease for all sites at the inception of the agreement was approximately 28 years, assuming renewals or extensions of the underlying ground leases for the sites. The Company has the option to purchase the leased sites in tranches, subject to the applicable lease, sublease or management rights upon its scheduled expiration. Each tower is assigned to an annual tranche, ranging from 2034 to 2047, which represents the outside expiration date for the sublease rights to the towers in that tranche. The purchase price for each tranche is a fixed amount stated in the lease for such tranche plus the fair market value of certain alterations made to the related F-49 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) towers. The aggregate purchase option price for the towers leased and subleased is approximately $ 5.0 billion. Verizon will occupy the sites as a tenant for an initial term of ten years with eight optional successive five -year terms; each such term shall be governed by standard master lease agreement terms established as a part of the transaction. AT&T Transaction —The Company has an agreement with SBC Communications Inc., a predecessor entity to AT&T Inc. (“AT&T”), that currently provides for the lease or sublease of approximately 2,100 towers commencing between December 2000 and August 2004. Substantially all of the towers are part of the Trust Securitizations. The average term of the lease or sublease for all sites at the inception of the agreement was approximately 27 years, assuming renewals or extensions of the underlying ground leases for the sites. The Company has the option to purchase the sites subject to the applicable lease or sublease upon its expiration. Each tower is assigned to an annual tranche, ranging from 2013 to 2032, which represents the outside expiration date for the sublease rights to that tower. The purchase price for each site is a fixed amount stated in the lease for that site plus the fair market value of certain alterations made to the related tower by AT&T. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has purchased an aggregate of 331 of the subleased towers which are subject to the applicable agreement, including 103 towers purchased during the year ended December 31, 2020 for an aggregate purchase price of $ 55.7 million. The aggregate purchase option price for the remaining towers leased and subleased is $ 973.4 million and includes per annum accretion through the applicable expiration of the lease or sublease of a site. For all such sites, AT&T has the right to continue to lease the reserved space through June 30, 2025 at the then-current monthly fee, which shall escalate in accordance with the standard master lease agreement for the remainder of AT&T’s tenancy. Thereafter, AT&T shall have the right to renew such lease for up to five successive five -year terms. Other Contingencies —The Company is subject to income tax and other taxes in the geographic areas where it holds assets or operates, and periodically receives notifications of audits, assessments or other actions by taxing authorities. Taxing authorities may issue notices or assessments while audits are being conducted. In certain jurisdictions, taxing authorities may issue assessments with minimal examination. These notices and assessments do not represent amounts that the Company is obligated to pay and are often not reflective of the actual tax liability for which the Company will ultimately be liable. In the process of responding to assessments of taxes that the Company believes are not enforceable, the Company avails itself of both administrative and judicial remedies. The Company evaluates the circumstances of each notification or assessment based on the information available and, in those instances in which the Company does not anticipate a successful defense of positions taken in its tax filings, a liability is recorded in the appropriate amount based on the underlying assessment. On December 5, 2016, the Company received an income tax assessment of Essar Telecom Infrastructure Private Limited (“ETIPL”) from the India Income Tax Department (the “Tax Department”) for the fiscal year ending 2008 in the amount of INR 4.75 billion ($ 69.8 million on the date of assessment) related to capital contributions. The Company challenged the assessment before the Office of Commissioner of Income Tax - Appeals, which ruled in the Company’s favor in January 2018. However, the Tax Department has appealed this ruling at a higher appellate authority. The Company estimates that there is a more likely than not probability that the Company’s position will be sustained upon appeal. Accordingly, no liability has been recorded. Additionally, the assessment was made with respect to transactions that took place in the tax year commencing in 2007, prior to the Company’s acquisition of ETIPL. Under the Company’s definitive acquisition agreement with ETIPL, the seller is obligated to indemnify and defend the Company with respect to any tax-related liability that may arise from activities prior to March 31, 2010. Guaranties and Indemnifications —The Company enters into agreements from time to time in the ordinary course of business pursuant to which it agrees to guarantee or indemnify third parties for certain claims. The Company has also entered into purchase and sale agreements relating to the sale or acquisition of assets containing customary indemnification provisions. The Company’s indemnification obligations under these agreements generally are limited solely to damages resulting from breaches of representations and warranties or covenants under the applicable agreements. In addition, payments under such indemnification clauses are generally conditioned on the other party making a claim that is subject to whatever defenses the Company may have and are governed by dispute resolution procedures specified in the particular agreement. Further, the Company’s obligations under these agreements may be limited in duration and amount, and in some instances, the Company may have recourse against third parties for payments made by the Company. The Company has not historically made any material payments under these agreements and, as of December 31, 2020, is not aware of any agreements that could result in a material payment. If the Company is unable to close the Pending Telxius Acquisition, as defined in note 23, the Company would be liable under the terms of the agreements to make certain payments to Telxius, which could be material.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS The Company’s primary business is leasing space on multitenant communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, wireless data providers, government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries. This business is referred to as the Company’s property operations. During the fourth quarter of 2020, as a result of the InSite Acquisition, the Company updated the names of its reportable segments to rename U.S. property and Asia property to U.S. & Canada property and Asia-Pacific property, respectively. The Company continues to report its results in six segments – U.S. & Canada property, Asia-Pacific property, Africa property, Europe property, Latin America property and services. This change was made to better align the names of the Company’s reportable segments with the geographical areas of the Company’s business operations following the InSite Acquisition. The change in the names the Company’s reportable segments is solely reflective of the inclusion of Canada and Australia in its business operations, as a result of the InSite Acquisition. The change in reportable segments had no impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements for any prior periods. Historical financial information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K has not been adjusted. As of December 31, 2020, the Company’s property operations consisted of the following: • U.S. & Canada: property operations in Canada and the United States; • Asia-Pacific: property operations in Australia and India; • Africa: property operations in Burkina Faso, Ghana, Kenya, Niger, Nigeria, South Africa and Uganda; • Europe: property operations in France, Germany and Poland; and • Latin America: property operations in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico, Paraguay and Peru. The Company’s services segment offers tower-related services in the United States, including AZP and structural analysis, which primarily support its site leasing business, including the addition of new tenants and equipment on its sites. The services segment is a strategic business unit that offers different services from, and requires different resources, skill sets and marketing strategies than, the property operating segments. The accounting policies applied in compiling segment information below are similar to those described in note 1. Among other factors, in evaluating financial performance in each business segment, management uses segment gross margin and segment operating profit. The Company defines segment gross margin as segment revenue less segment operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation expense recorded in costs of operations; Depreciation, amortization and accretion; Selling, general, administrative and development expense; and Other operating expenses. The Company defines segment operating profit as segment gross margin less Selling, general, administrative and development expense attributable to the segment, excluding stock-based compensation expense and corporate expenses. For reporting purposes, for periods through September 30, 2018, F-51 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) the Latin America property segment gross margin and segment operating profit also included Interest income (expense), TV Azteca, net. These measures of segment gross margin and segment operating profit are also before Interest income, Interest expense, Gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations, Other income (expense), Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and Income tax benefit (provision). The categories of expenses indicated above, such as depreciation, have been excluded from segment operating performance as they are not considered in the review of information or the evaluation of results by management. There are no significant revenues resulting from transactions between the Company’s operating segments. All intercompany transactions are eliminated to reconcile segment results and assets to the consolidated statements of operations and consolidated balance sheets. Summarized financial information concerning the Company’s reportable segments for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 is shown in the following tables. The “Other” column (i) represents amounts excluded from specific segments, such as business development operations, stock-based compensation expense and corporate expenses included in Selling, general, administrative and development expense; Other operating expenses; Interest income; Interest expense; Gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations; and Other income (expense), and (ii) reconciles segment operating profit to Income from continuing operations before income taxes.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS Pending Telxius Acquisition— On January 13, 2021, the Company entered into two agreements with Telxius Telecom, S.A. (“Telxius”), a subsidiary of Telefónica, S.A., pursuant to which the Company expects to acquire Telxius’ European and Latin American tower divisions, comprising approximately 31,000 communications sites in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Germany, Peru and Spain, for approximately 7.7 billion EUR (approximately $ 9.4 billion at the date of signing) (the “Pending Telxius Acquisition”), subject to limited adjustments. The Pending Telxius Acquisition is expected to close in tranches beginning in the second quarter of 2021, subject to customary closing conditions, including government and regulatory approval. Repayment of the 2020 Term Loan —On February 5, 2021, the Company repaid all amounts outstanding under the 2020 Term Loan with borrowings from the 2019 Multicurrency Credit Facility and cash on hand. Amendments to Bank Facilities —On February 10, 2021, the Company amended and restated the 2019 Multicurrency Credit Facility and the 2019 Credit Facility and entered into an amendment agreement with respect to the 2019 Term Loan. These amendments, among other things, i. extend the maturity dates by one year to June 28, 2024 and January 31, 2026 for the 2019 Multicurrency Credit Facility and the 2019 Credit Facility, respectively, ii. increase the commitments under the 2019 Multicurrency Credit Facility and the 2019 Credit Facility to $ 4.1 billion and $ 2.9 billion, respectively, of which 1.3 billion EUR borrowed under the 2019 Multicurrency Credit Facility is to be reserved to finance the Pending Telxius Acquisition, iii. increase the maximum Revolving Loan Commitments, after giving effect to any Incremental Commitments (each as defined in the loan agreements for each of the 2019 Multicurrency Credit Facility and the 2019 Credit Facility) to $ 6.1 billion and $ 4.4 billion under the 2019 Multicurrency Credit Facility and the 2019 Credit Facility, respectively, iv. expand the sublimit for multicurrency borrowings under the 2019 Multicurrency Credit Facility from $ 1.0 billion to $ 3.0 billion and add a EUR borrowing option for the 2019 Credit Facility with a $ 1.5 billion sublimit, v. amend the limitation of the Company’s permitted ratio of Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDA (each as defined in each of the loan agreements for each of the facilities) to be no greater than 7.50 to 1.00 for the four fiscal quarters following the consummation of the Pending Telxius Acquisition, stepping down to 6.00 to 1.00 thereafter (with a further step up to 7.00 to 1.00 if the Company consummates a Qualified Acquisition (as defined in each of the loan agreements for the facilities)), vi. amend the limitation on indebtedness of, and guaranteed by, the Company’s subsidiaries to the greater of (a) $ 3.0 billion and (b) 50 % of Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in each of the loan agreements for the facilities) of the Company and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis and vii. increase the threshold for certain defaults with respect to judgments, attachments or acceleration of indebtedness from $ 400.0 million to $ 500.0 million. 2021 Delayed Draw Term Loans —On February 10, 2021, the Company entered into (i) a 1.1 billion EUR (approximately $ 1.3 billion at the date of signing) unsecured term loan, the proceeds of which are to be used to fund the Pending Telxius Acquisition, with a maturity date that is 364 days from the date of the first draw thereunder and bears interest at a rate based on the senior unsecured debt rating of the Company, which, based on the Company’s current debt ratings, is 1.000 % above the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”) (the “2021 364 -Day Delayed Draw Term Loan”) and (ii) an 825.0 million EUR (approximately $ 1.0 billion at the date of signing) unsecured term loan, the proceeds of which are to be used to fund the Pending Telxius Acquisition, with a maturity date that is three years from the date of the first draw thereunder and bears interest at a rate based on the senior unsecured debt rating of the Company, which, based on the Company’s current debt ratings, is 1.125 % above EURIBOR (the “2021 Three Year Delayed Draw Term Loan,” and, together with the 2021 364 -Day Delayed Draw Term Loan, the “2021 Delayed Draw Term Loans”). The loan agreements for the 2021 Delayed Draw Term Loans contain certain reporting, information, financial and operating covenants and other restrictions (including limitations on additional debt, guaranties, sales of assets and liens) with which the Company must comply. Failure to comply with the financial and operating covenants of the loan agreements could not only prevent the Company from being able to borrow additional funds under the revolving credit facilities, but may constitute a default, which could result in, among other things, the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable. F-57 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) Bridge Facility —In connection with entering into the Pending Telxius Acquisition, the Company entered into a commitment letter (the “Commitment Letter”), dated January 13, 2021, with Bank of America, N.A. and BofA Securities, Inc. (together, “BoA”) pursuant to which BoA has committed to provide up to 7.5 billion EUR (approximately $ 9.1 billion at date of signing) in bridge loans (the “Bridge Loan Commitment”) to ensure financing for the Pending Telxius Acquisition. Effective February 10, 2021, the Bridge Loan Commitment was reduced to 4.275 billion EUR (approximately $ 5.2 billion at the date of signing) as a result of an aggregate of 3.225 billion EUR (approximately $ 3.9 billion at the date of signing) of additional committed amounts under the 2019 Multicurrency Credit Facility, the 2019 Credit Facility and the 2021 Delayed Draw Term Loans, as described above. The Commitment Letter contains, and the credit agreement in respect of the Bridge Loan Commitment, if any, will contain, certain customary conditions to funding, including, without limitation, (i) the execution and delivery of definitive financing agreements for the Bridge Loan Commitment and (ii) other customary closing conditions set forth in the Commitment Letter. The Company will pay certain customary commitment fees and, in the event it makes any borrowings in connection with the Bridge Loan Commitment, funding and other fees.

Form 10-K Summary 66 Signatures 67 Index to Consolidated Financial Statements F-1 SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This Annual Report on Form 10-K (this “Annual Report”) contains statements about future events and expectations, or forward-looking statements, all of which are inherently uncertain. We have based those forward-looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future results. When we use words such as “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects” or similar expressions, we are making forward-looking statements. Examples of forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements we make regarding future prospects of growth in the communications site leasing industry, the effects of consolidation among companies in our industry and among our tenants and other competitive and financial pressures, the level of future expenditures by companies in this industry and other trends in this industry, changes in zoning, tax and other laws and regulations and administrative and judicial decisions, economic, political and other events, particularly those relating to our international operations, our future capital expenditure levels, the impact of technology changes on our industry and our business, our ability to maintain or increase our market share, our plans to fund our future liquidity needs, our substantial leverage and debt service obligations, our future financing transactions, our future operating results, our ability to remain qualified for taxation as a real estate investment trust (REIT), the amount and timing of any future distributions including those we are required to make as a REIT, natural disasters and similar events and our ability to protect our rights to the land under our towers. These statements are based on our management’s beliefs and assumptions, which in turn are based on currently available information. These assumptions could prove inaccurate. These forward-looking statements may be found under the captions “Business” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” as well as in this Annual Report generally. ii Table of Contents You should keep in mind that any forward-looking statement we make in this Annual Report or elsewhere speaks only as of the date on which we make it. New risks and uncertainties arise from time to time, and it is impossible for us to predict these events or how they may affect us. In any event, these and other important factors, including those set forth in Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption “Risk Factors,” may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by our forward-looking statements. We have no duty, and do not intend, to update or revise the forward-looking statements we make in this Annual Report, except as may be required by law. In light of these risks and uncertainties, you should keep in mind that the future events or circumstances described in any forward-looking statement we make in this Annual Report or elsewhere might not occur. References in this Annual Report to “we,” “our” and the “Company” refer to American Tower Corporation and its predecessor, as applicable, individually and collectively with its subsidiaries as the context requires. iii Table of Contents PART I ITEM 1. BUSINESS Overview We are one of the largest global real estate investment trusts and a leading independent owner, operator and developer of multitenant communications real estate. Our primary business is the leasing of space on communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, wireless data providers, government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries. We refer to this business as our property operations, which accounted for 98% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 . We also offer tower-related services in the United States, which we refer to as our services operations. These services include site acquisition, zoning and permitting and structural analysis, which primarily support our site leasing business, including the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites. American Tower Corporation was originally created as a subsidiary of American Radio Systems Corporation in 1995 and was spun off into a free-standing public company in 1998. We are a holding company and conduct our operations through our directly and indirectly owned subsidiaries and joint ventures. Our principal domestic operating subsidiaries are American Towers LLC and SpectraSite Communications, LLC. We conduct our international operations primarily through our subsidiary, American Tower International, Inc., which in turn conducts operations through its various international holding and operating subsidiaries and joint ventures. Since inception, we have grown our communications real estate portfolio through acquisitions, long-term lease arrangements and site development. Our portfolio primarily consists of towers that we own and towers that we operate pursuant to long-term lease arrangements, as well as distributed antenna system (“DAS”) networks, which provide seamless coverage solutions in certain in-building and outdoor wireless environments. In addition to the communications sites in our portfolio, we manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements. We also hold other telecommunications infrastructure, fiber and property interests that we lease primarily to communications service providers and third-party tower operators. In 2019, we added approximately 5,800 communications sites to our portfolio in Africa and launched operations in Burkina Faso and Niger as part of our acquisition of Eaton Towers Holdings Limited (“Eaton Towers,” and the acquisition, the “Eaton Towers Acquisition”). We also signed a definitive agreement to acquire approximately 3,200 communications sites in Chile and Peru from Entel PCS Telecomunicaciones S.A. and Entel Peru S.A. and closed on the first tranche of sites, adding approximately 2,400 communications sites to our portfolio in Latin America (the “Entel Acquisition”). The remaining communications sites are expected to close in tranches beginning in the first quarter of 2020, subject to certain closing conditions. As of December 31, 2019 , our communications real estate portfolio of 179,520 communications sites included 40,974 communications sites in the U.S., 74,712 communications sites in Asia, 18,370 communications sites in Africa, 4,736 communications sites in Europe and 40,728 communications sites in Latin America, as well as urban telecommunications assets in Argentina, Brazil, India, Mexico and South Africa. We operate as a real estate investment trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes (“REIT”). Accordingly, we generally are not required to pay U.S. federal income taxes on income generated by our REIT operations, including the income derived from leasing space on our towers, as we receive a dividends paid deduction for distributions to stockholders that generally offsets our REIT income and gains. However, we remain obligated to pay U.S. federal income taxes on earnings from our domestic taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRSs”). In addition, our international assets and operations, regardless of their classification for U.S. tax purposes, continue to be subject to taxation in the jurisdictions where those assets are held or those operations are conducted. The use of TRSs enables us to continue to engage in certain businesses while complying with REIT qualification requirements. We may, from time to time, change the election of previously designated TRSs to be included as part of the REIT. As of December 31, 2019 , our REIT-qualified businesses included our U.S. tower leasing business and a majority of our U.S. indoor DAS networks business and services segment, as well as most of our operations in Mexico, Germany, Costa Rica, Nigeria and France. During the fourth quarter of 2019, as a result of recent acquisitions, including the Eaton Towers Acquisition, and changes to our organizational structure, we reviewed and changed our reportable segments to divide our Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) property segment into two separate segments, Africa property and Europe property. We now report our results in six segments – U.S. property, Asia property, Africa property, Europe property, Latin America property and services. We believe this change provides more visibility into these operating segments and better aligns our reporting with management’s current approach of allocating costs and resources, managing growth and profitability and assessing the operating performance of our business segments. 1 Table of Contents Products and Services Property Operations Our property operations accounted for 98% , 98% and 99% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Our revenue is primarily generated from tenant leases. Our tenants lease space on our communications real estate, where they install and maintain their equipment. Rental payments vary considerably depending upon numerous factors, including, but not limited to, amount, type and position of tenant equipment on the tower, remaining tower capacity and tower location. Our costs typically include ground rent (which is primarily fixed under long-term lease agreements with annual cost escalations) and power and fuel costs, some or all of which may be passed through to our tenants, as well as property taxes and repair and maintenance expenses. Our property operations have generated consistent growth in revenue and typically have low cash flow volatility due to the following characteristics: • Long-term tenant leases with contractual rent escalations. In general, our tenant leases with wireless carriers have initial non-cancellable terms of five to ten years with multiple renewal terms, with provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease, typically annually, based on a fixed escalation percentage (averaging approximately 3% in the United States) or an inflationary index in our international markets, or a combination of both. Based upon foreign currency exchange rates and the tenant leases in place as of December 31, 2019 , we expect to generate nearly $46.9 billion of non-cancellable tenant lease revenue over future periods, before the impact of straight-line lease accounting. • Consistent demand for our sites. As a result of rapidly growing usage of mobile data and other wireless services and the corresponding wireless industry capital spending trends in the markets we serve, we anticipate consistent demand for our communications sites. We believe that our global asset base positions us well to benefit from the increasing proliferation of advanced wireless devices and the increasing usage of high bandwidth applications on those devices. We have the ability to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our sites, which typically results in incremental revenue and modest incremental costs. Our site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with a solid platform for new business opportunities, which has historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth. • High lease renewal rates. Our tenants tend to renew leases because suitable alternative sites may not exist or be available and repositioning a site in their network may be expensive and may adversely affect network quality. Historically, churn has averaged approximately 1% to 2% of tenant billings per year. We define churn as tenant billings lost when a tenant cancels or does not renew its lease or, in limited circumstances, when the lease rates on existing leases are reduced. We derive our churn rate for a given year by dividing our tenant billings lost on this basis by our prior-year tenant billings. As discussed in Item 7 of this Annual Report under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Executive Overview,” we experienced elevated levels of churn in recent years due to carrier consolidation-driven churn in India. We anticipate that our churn rate will move closer to historical levels over time, however, in the immediate term, we expect that our churn rate will remain elevated, primarily due to the uncertainty created by the recent court ruling by the Indian Supreme Court, as set forth in Item 1A of this Annual Report under the captions “Risk Factors—A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of tenants, and we are sensitive to adverse changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our tenants” and “Risk Factors—Our business, and that of our tenants, is subject to laws, regulations and administrative and judicial decisions, and changes thereto, that could restrict our ability to operate our business as we currently do or impact our competitive landscape.” • High operating margins. Incremental operating costs associated with adding new tenants or equipment to an existing communications site are relatively minimal. Therefore, as tenants or equipment are added, the substantial majority of incremental revenue flows through to gross margin and operating profit. In addition, in many of our international markets certain expenses, such as ground rent or power and fuel costs, are reimbursed or shared by our tenant base. • Low maintenance capital expenditures. On average, we require relatively low amounts of annual capital expenditures to maintain our communications sites. Our property business includes the operation of communications sites and managed networks, the leasing of property interests, and, in select markets, the operation of fiber and the provision of backup power through shared generators. Our presence in a number of markets at different relative stages of wireless development provides us with significant diversification and long-term growth potential. Our property segments accounted for the following percentage of consolidated total revenue 2 Table of Contents for the years ended December 31,: 2019 2018 2017 U.S. 55 % 51 % 55 % Asia 16 % 21 % 17 % Africa 8 % 7 % 7 % Europe 2 % 2 % 2 % Latin America 18 % 17 % 18 % Communications Sites. Approximately 95%, 96% and 97% of revenue in our property segments was attributable to our communications sites, excluding DAS networks, for the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. We lease space on our communications sites to tenants providing a diverse range of communications services, including cellular voice and data, broadcasting, mobile video and a number of other applications. In addition, in many of our international markets, we receive pass-through revenue from our tenants to cover certain costs, including power and fuel costs and ground rent. Our top tenants by revenue for each region are as follows for the year ended December 31, 2019 : • U.S.: AT&T Inc. (“AT&T”); Verizon Wireless; T-Mobile US, Inc. (“T-Mobile”); and Sprint Corporation (“Sprint”) accounted for an aggregate of 89% of U.S. property segment revenue. T-Mobile and Sprint have announced plans to merge in 2020. • Asia: Vodafone Idea Limited; Bharti Airtel Limited (“Airtel”); and Reliance Jio accounted for an aggregate of 83% of Asia property segment revenue. • Africa: MTN Group Limited (“MTN”); and Airtel accounted for an aggregate of 74% of Africa property segment revenue. • Europe: Telefónica S.A (“Telefónica”); Bouygues; and Free accounted for an aggregate of 70% of Europe property segment revenue. • Latin America: Telefónica; AT&T; and América Móvil accounted for an aggregate of 58% of Latin America property segment revenue. Accordingly, we are subject to certain risks, as set forth in Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption “Risk Factors—A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of tenants, and we are sensitive to changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our tenants.” In addition, we are subject to risks related to our international operations, as set forth under the caption “Risk Factors—Our foreign operations are subject to economic, political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position, including risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.” Managed Networks, Property Interests, Fiber and Shared Generators. In addition to our communications sites, we also own and operate several types of managed network solutions, provide communications site management services to third parties, manage and lease property interests under carrier or other third-party communications sites, provide the right to use fiber and provide back-up power sources to tenants at our sites. The balance of our property segment revenue not attributable to our communications sites was attributable to these items. • Managed Networks. We own and operate DAS networks in the United States and certain international markets. We obtain rights from property owners to install and operate in-building DAS networks, and we grant rights to wireless service providers to attach their equipment to our installations. We also offer a small portfolio of outdoor DAS networks as a complementary shared infrastructure solution for our tenants in the United States and in certain international markets. Typically, we have designed, built and operated our outdoor DAS networks in areas in which zoning restrictions or other barriers may prevent or delay deployment of more traditional wireless communications sites, such as macro tower sites. We also hold lease rights and easement interests on rooftops capable of hosting communications equipment in locations where towers are generally not a viable solution based on area characteristics. In addition, we provide management services to property owners in the United States who elect to retain full rights to their property while simultaneously marketing the rooftop for wireless communications equipment installation. As the demand for advanced wireless services in urban markets evolves, we continue to evaluate a variety of infrastructure solutions, including small cells and other network architectures that may support our tenants’ networks in these areas. • Fiber and Related Assets. We own and operate fiber and related assets in Argentina, Brazil, India, Mexico, South Africa and the United States, which we currently provide the right to use to communications and internet service providers and third-party operators to support their telecommunications infrastructure. We expect to continue to 3 Table of Contents evaluate opportunities to invest in and provide the right to use these and other similar assets to providers and operators in the future for additional fourth generation (4G) and fifth generation (5G) deployments. • Property Interests . We own a portfolio of property interests in the United States under carrier or other third-party communications sites, which provides recurring cash flow under complementary leasing arrangements. • Shared Generators . We have contracts with certain of our tenants in the United States pursuant to which we provide access to shared backup power generators. Services Operations We offer tower-related services in the United States, including site acquisition, zoning and permitting and structural analysis services. Our services operations primarily support our site leasing business, including through the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites. This segment accounted for 2% , 2% and 1% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Site Acquisition, Zoning and Permitting . We engage in site acquisition services on our own behalf in connection with our tower development projects, as well as on behalf of our tenants. We typically work with our tenants’ engineers to determine the geographic areas where new communications sites will best address the tenants’ needs and meet their coverage objectives. Once a new site is identified, we acquire the rights to the land or structure on which the site will be constructed, and we manage the permitting process to ensure all necessary approvals are obtained to construct and operate the communications site. Structural Analysis. We offer structural analysis services to wireless carriers in connection with the installation of their communications equipment on our towers. Our team of engineers can evaluate whether a tower structure can support the additional burden of the new equipment or if an upgrade is needed, which enables our tenants to better assess potential sites before making an installation decision. Our structural analysis capabilities enable us to provide higher quality service to our existing tenants by, among other things, reducing the time required to achieve on-air readiness, while also providing opportunities to offer structural analysis services to third parties. Strategy Operational Strategy As the use of wireless services on handsets, tablets and other advanced mobile devices grows and evolves, there is a corresponding increase in demand for the communications infrastructure required to deploy current and future generations of wireless communications technologies. To capture this demand, our primary operational focus is to (i) increase the occupancy of our existing communications real estate portfolio to support global connectivity, (ii) invest in and selectively grow our communications real estate portfolio, (iii) further improve our operational performance and efficiency, including through innovation initiatives and (iv) maintain a strong balance sheet. We believe these efforts to meet our tenants’ needs will support and enhance our ability to capitalize on the growth in demand for wireless infrastructure. In addition, we expect to explore new opportunities to enhance or extend our shared communications infrastructure businesses, including those that may make our assets incrementally more attractive to new tenants, or to existing tenants for new uses, and those that increase our operational efficiency. • Increase the occupancy of our existing communications real estate portfolio to support global connectivity. We believe that our highest incremental returns will be achieved by leasing additional space on our existing communications sites. Increasing demand for wireless services in our served markets has resulted in significant capital spending by major wireless carriers and other connectivity providers. As a result, we anticipate growing demand for our communications sites because they are attractively located and typically have capacity available for additional tenants and equipment. In the United States, incremental carrier network activity is being driven primarily by the construction and densification of 4G networks, as well as initial deployments of 5G. In our international markets, carriers are deploying a combination of second generation (2G), third generation (3G) and, more recently, 4G networks, depending on the specific market. We believe that the majority of our towers have capacity for additional tenants and that substantially all of our towers that are currently at or near full structural capacity can be upgraded or augmented to meet future tenant demand with relatively modest capital investment. Therefore, we will continue to target our sales and marketing activities to increase the utilization and return on investment of our existing communications sites. • Invest in and selectively grow our communications real estate portfolio to meet our tenants’ needs. We seek opportunities to invest in and grow our operations through our capital expenditure program, new site construction and acquisitions. We believe we can achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns by pursuing such investments. In addition, we seek to secure property interests under our communications sites to improve operating margins as we reduce our cash operating expense related to ground leases. A significant portion of our inorganic growth has been focused on 4 Table of Contents properties with lower initial tenancy because we believe that over time we can significantly increase tenancy levels, and therefore, drive strong returns on those assets. • Further improve our operational performance and efficiency, including through innovation initiatives. We continue to seek opportunities to improve our operational performance throughout the organization. This includes investing in our systems and people as we strive to improve efficiency and provide superior service to our tenants. To achieve this, we intend to continue to focus on customer service initiatives, such as reducing cycle times for key functions, including lease processing and tower structural analysis. Through our innovation program, we are also focused on developing and implementing renewable power solutions across our footprint to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and help improve the overall efficiency of the communications infrastructure and wireless industries. We also expect to use our innovation program to explore additional ways to enhance the efficiency of our operations over time. • Maintain a strong balance sheet. We remain committed to disciplined financial policies, which we believe result in our ability to maintain a strong balance sheet and will support our overall strategy and focus on asset growth and operational excellence. As a result of these policies, we currently have investment grade credit ratings. We continue to focus on maintaining a robust liquidity position and, as of December 31, 2019 , had $4.4 billion of available liquidity. We believe that our investment grade credit ratings provide us consistent access to the capital markets and our liquidity provides us the ability to continue to invest in growing and augmenting our business. Capital Allocation Strategy The objective of our capital allocation strategy is to simultaneously increase adjusted funds from operations and our return on invested capital over the long term. To maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT, we are required annually to distribute an amount equal to at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain) to our stockholders. After complying with our REIT distribution requirements, we plan to continue to allocate our available capital among investment alternatives that meet or exceed our return on investment criteria, while taking into account the repayment of debt consistent with our financial policies. • Capital expenditure program. We expect to continue to invest in and expand our existing communications real estate portfolio through our capital expenditure program. This includes capital expenditures associated with site maintenance, increasing the capacity of our existing sites and projects such as new site construction, land interest acquisitions and power solutions. • Acquisitions. We intend to pursue acquisitions of communications sites and other telecommunications infrastructure in our existing or new markets where we can meet or exceed our risk-adjusted return on investment criteria. The risk-adjusted hurdle rates used to evaluate acquisition opportunities consider additional factors such as the country and counterparties involved, investment and economic climate, legal and regulatory conditions and industry risk, among others. • Return excess capital to stockholders . If we have excess capital available after funding (i) our required distributions, (ii) capital expenditures, (iii) the repayment of debt consistent with our financial policies and (iv) anticipated future investments, including acquisition and select innovation opportunities, we will seek to return such excess capital to stockholders, including through our stock repurchase programs. International Growth Strategy We believe that, in certain international markets, we can create substantial value by either establishing a new, or expanding our existing, communications real estate leasing business. Therefore, we expect we will continue to seek international growth opportunities where we believe our risk-adjusted return objectives can be achieved. We strive to maintain a diversified approach to our international growth strategy by operating in a geographically diverse array of markets in a variety of stages of wireless network development. Our international growth strategy includes a disciplined, individualized market evaluation, in which we conduct the following analyses, among others: • Country analysis. Prior to entering a new market, we conduct an extensive review of the country’s historical and projected macroeconomic fundamentals, including inflation and foreign currency exchange rate trends, demographics, capital markets, tax regime and investment alternatives, and the general business, political and legal environments, including property rights and regulatory regime. • Wireless industry analysis. To confirm the presence of sufficient demand to support an independent tower leasing model, we analyze the competitiveness of the country’s wireless market. This includes an evaluation of the industry’s pricing environment, past and potential consolidation and the stage of its wireless network development. Characteristics that result in an attractive investment opportunity include (i) multiple competitive wireless service providers who are actively seeking to invest in deploying voice and data networks and (ii) ongoing or expected deployment of incremental spectrum from recent or anticipated auctions. 5 Table of Contents • Opportunity and counterparty analysis. Once an investment opportunity is identified within a geographic area with an attractive wireless industry, we conduct a multifaceted opportunity and counterparty analysis. This includes evaluating (i) the type of transaction, (ii) its ability to meet our risk-adjusted return criteria given the country and the counterparties involved, including the anticipated anchor tenant and (iii) how the transaction fits within our long-term strategic objectives, including future potential investment and expansion within the region. Regulatory Matters Towers, Antennas and Fiber. Our U.S. and international tower leasing businesses are subject to national, state and local regulatory requirements with respect to the registration, siting, construction, lighting, marking and maintenance of our towers. In the United States, which accounted for 56% of our total property segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 , the construction of new towers or modifications to existing towers may require pre-approval by the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) and the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”), depending on factors such as tower height and proximity to public airfields. Towers requiring pre-approval must be registered with the FCC and maintained in accordance with FAA standards. Similar requirements regarding pre-approval of the construction and modification of towers are imposed by regulators in other countries. Non-compliance with applicable tower-related requirements may lead to monetary penalties or site deconstruction orders. Certain of our international operations are subject to regulatory requirements with respect to licensing, registration, permitting and public listings. In India, our subsidiary, ATC Telecom Infrastructure Private Limited (“ATC TIPL”), holds an Infrastructure Provider Category-I (“IP-I”) Registration Certificate issued by the Indian Ministry of Communications and Information Technology, which permits us to provide tower space to companies licensed as telecommunications service providers under the Indian Telegraph Act of 1885. As a condition to the IP-I, the Indian government has the right to take over telecommunications infrastructure in the case of emergency or war. Additionally, in 2018, ATC TIPL issued non-convertible debentures, which are listed on the National Stock Exchange of India. Although the debt is held by another subsidiary of ours and is eliminated in consolidation, ATC TIPL is still subject to the listing requirements of such exchange. In Africa, our subsidiaries in Ghana, Kenya, Niger, Nigeria and Uganda are required to hold a license in order to establish and maintain passive telecommunications infrastructure services and DAS networks for communications service providers. In Burkina Faso, a new licensing regime was recently enacted which will require any subsidiary there to be licensed in 2020. Additionally, in Uganda, our subsidiary is subject to review for three years commencing in 2020 by a monitoring trustee regarding compliance with certain conditions of approval of the Eaton Towers Acquisition. In Latin America, our subsidiaries in Chile and Argentina hold licenses for the provision of passive telecommunications infrastructure and, in Argentina, for leasing of fiber. The subsidiaries that hold our fiber business in Mexico and Brazil are also licensed and regulated as concession holders and permit holders authorized to provide telecommunications services. In many of the markets in which we operate, we are required to provide tower space to service providers on a non-discriminatory basis, subject to the negotiation of mutually agreeable terms. Our international business operations may be subject to increased licensing fees or ownership restrictions. For example, in South Africa, the Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment Act, 2003 (the “BBBEE Act”) has established a legislative framework for the promotion of economic empowerment of South African citizens disadvantaged by Apartheid. Accordingly, the BBBEE Act and related codes measure BBBEE Act compliance and good corporate practice by the inclusion of certain ownership, management control, employment equity and other metrics for companies that do business there. In Kenya, our regulator requires all holders of a commercial license to issue at least 20% of their shares to Kenyans within three years of receiving the license unless a waiver is obtained. In addition, certain municipalities have sought to impose permit fees based upon structural or operational requirements of towers and certain regional and other governmental bodies have sought to impose levies or other forms of fees. Our foreign operations may be affected if a country’s regulatory authority restricts, revokes or modifies spectrum licenses of certain wireless service providers or implements limitations on foreign ownership. In all countries where we operate, we are subject to zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by local authorities or community organizations. While these regulations vary, they typically require tower owners or tenants to obtain approval from local authorities or community standards organizations prior to tower construction or the addition of a new antenna to an existing tower. Local zoning authorities and community residents often oppose construction in their communities, which can delay or prevent new tower construction, new antenna installation or site upgrade projects, thereby limiting our ability to respond to tenant demand. This opposition and existing or new zoning regulations can increase costs associated with new tower construction, tower modifications or additions of new antennas to a site or site upgrades, as well as adversely affect the associated timing or cost of such projects. Further, additional regulations may be adopted that cause delays or result in additional costs to us or changes in the competitive landscape that may negatively affect our business. These factors could materially and adversely affect our operations. In the United States, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 prohibits any action 6 Table of Contents by state and local authorities that would discriminate between different providers of wireless services or ban altogether the construction, modification or placement of communications sites. It also prohibits state or local restrictions based on the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent the facilities comply with FCC regulations. Further, in February 2012, the United States government adopted regulations requiring that local and state governments approve modifications or colocations that qualify as eligible facilities under the regulations. Portions of our business are subject to additional regulations, for example, in a number of states throughout the United States, certain of our subsidiaries hold Competitive Local Exchange Carrier (CLEC) or other status, in connection with the operation of our outdoor DAS networks business. In addition, we, or our tenants, may be subject to new regulatory policies in certain jurisdictions from time to time that may materially and adversely affect our business or the demand for our communications sites. Environmental Matters. Our U.S. and international operations are subject to various national, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the management, use, storage, disposal, emission and remediation of, and exposure to, hazardous and non-hazardous substances, materials and wastes and the siting of our towers. We may be required to obtain permits, pay additional property taxes, comply with regulatory requirements and make certain informational filings related to hazardous substances or devices used to provide power such as batteries, generators and fuel at our sites. Violations of these types of regulations could subject us to fines or criminal sanctions. Additionally, in the United States and in other countries where we operate, before constructing a new tower or adding an antenna to an existing site, we must review and evaluate the impact of the action to determine whether it may significantly affect the environment and whether we must disclose any significant impacts in an environmental assessment. If a tower or new antenna might have a material adverse impact on the environment, FCC or other governmental approval of the tower or antenna could be significantly delayed. Health and Safety. In the United States and in other countries where we operate, we are subject to various national, state and local laws regarding employee health and safety, including protection from radio frequency exposure. Competition Our industry is highly competitive. We compete, both for new business and for the acquisition of assets, with other public tower companies, such as Crown Castle International Corp., SBA Communications Corporation, Telesites S.A.B. de C.V. and Cellnex Telecom, S.A., wireless carrier tower consortia such as Indus Towers Limited and private tower companies, private equity sponsored firms, carrier-affiliated tower companies, independent wireless carriers, tower owners, broadcasters and owners of non-communications sites, including rooftops, utility towers, water towers and other alternative structures. We believe that site location and capacity, network density, price, quality and speed of service have been, and will continue to be, significant competitive factors affecting owners, operators and managers of communications sites. Our services business competes with a variety of companies offering individual, or combinations of, competing services. The field of competitors includes site acquisition consultants, zoning consultants, real estate firms, right-of-way consultants, structural engineering firms, tower owners/managers, telecommunications equipment vendors who can provide turnkey site development services through multiple subcontractors and our tenants’ personnel. We believe that our tenants base their decisions for services on various criteria, including a company’s experience, local reputation, price and time for completion of a project. For more information on demand trends in our industry, see Item 7 of this Annual Report under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Executive Overview.” Employees As of December 31, 2019 , we employed 5,454 full-time individuals and consider our employee relations to be satisfactory. 7 Table of Contents Executive Officers For information about our Executive Officers, see Item 10 of this Annual Report under the caption “Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance.” Available Information Our internet website address is www.americantower.com .

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS A significant decrease in leasing demand for our communications infrastructure would materially and adversely affect our business and operating results, and we cannot control that demand. A significant reduction in leasing demand for our communications infrastructure would materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. Factors that may affect such demand include: • increased mergers, consolidations or exits that reduce the number of wireless service providers or increased use of network sharing among governments or wireless service providers; • the financial condition of wireless service providers; • zoning, environmental, health, tax or other government regulations or changes in the application and enforcement thereof; • governmental licensing of spectrum or restriction or revocation of our tenants’ spectrum licenses; • a decrease in consumer demand for wireless services, including due to general economic conditions, disruption in the financial and credit markets or global social or political crises; • the ability and willingness of wireless service providers to maintain or increase capital expenditures on network infrastructure; • delays or changes in the deployment of next generation wireless technologies; and • technological changes. If our tenants consolidate their operations, exit the telecommunications business or share site infrastructure to a significant degree, our growth, revenue and ability to generate positive cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Significant consolidation among our tenants could reduce demand for our communications infrastructure and may materially and adversely affect our growth and revenues. Certain combined companies have rationalized duplicative parts of their networks or modernized their networks, and these and other tenants could determine not to renew, or attempt to cancel, avoid or limit leases or related payments with us. In the event a tenant terminates its business or separately sells its spectrum, we may experience increased churn as a result. Our ongoing contractual revenues and our future results may be negatively impacted if a significant number of these leases are terminated or not renewed. For example, see our discussion of carrier consolidation-driven churn in our Asia segment in Item 7 of this Annual Report, under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Executive Overview.” In addition, extensive sharing of site 8 Table of Contents infrastructure, roaming or resale arrangements among wireless service providers as an alternative to leasing our communications sites, without compensation to us, may cause new lease activity to slow if carriers utilize shared equipment rather than deploy new equipment, or may result in the decommissioning of equipment on certain existing sites because portions of the tenants’ networks may become redundant. A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of tenants, and we are sensitive to adverse changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our tenants. A substantial portion of our total operating revenues is derived from a small number of tenants. If any of these tenants are unwilling or unable to perform their obligations under their agreements with us, our revenues, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected. One or more of our tenants, or their parent companies, may experience financial difficulties, file for bankruptcy or reduce or terminate operations as a result of a prolonged economic downturn, economic difficulties (including those from the imposition of taxes, fees, regulations or judicial interpretations of regulations, and any associated penalties or interest, which may be substantial, such as those imposed in India as a result of the October 2019 Indian Supreme Court ruling regarding the definition of adjusted gross revenue (“AGR”) and associated fees and charges), or otherwise. Such financial difficulties could result in uncollectible accounts receivable and an impairment of our deferred rent asset, tower asset, network location intangible asset, tenant-related intangible asset or goodwill. The loss of significant tenants, or the loss of all or a portion of our anticipated lease revenues from certain tenants, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Due to the long-term nature of our tenant leases, we depend on the continued financial strength of our tenants. Many wireless service providers operate with substantial levels of debt. In our international operations, many of our tenants are subsidiaries of global telecommunications companies. These subsidiaries may not have the explicit or implied financial support of their parent entities. In addition, many of our tenants and potential tenants rely on capital raising activities to fund their operations and capital expenditures, which may be more difficult or expensive in the event of downturns in the economy or disruptions in the financial and credit markets. If our tenants or potential tenants are unable to raise adequate capital to fund their business plans or face capital constraints, they may reduce their spending, file for bankruptcy or reduce or terminate operations, which could materially and adversely affect demand for our communications sites and our services business. In the ordinary course of our business, we do occasionally experience disputes with our tenants, generally regarding the interpretation of terms in our leases. Historically, we have resolved these disputes in a manner that did not have a material adverse effect on us or our tenant relationships. However, it is possible that such disputes could lead to a termination of our leases with those tenants, a material adverse modification of the terms of those leases or a deterioration in our relationships with those tenants that leads to a failure to obtain new business from them, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. If we are forced to resolve any of these disputes through litigation, our relationship with the applicable tenant could be terminated or damaged, which could lead to decreased revenue or increased costs, resulting in a corresponding adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Our business, and that of our tenants, is subject to laws, regulations and administrative and judicial decisions, and changes thereto, that could restrict our ability to operate our business as we currently do or impact our competitive landscape. Our business, and that of our tenants, is subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws, treaties and regulations and administrative and judicial decisions. In certain jurisdictions, these regulations, laws and treaties could be applied or be enforced retroactively. Zoning authorities and community organizations are often opposed to the construction of communications sites in their communities, which can delay, prevent or increase the cost of new tower construction, modifications, additions of new antennas to a site or site upgrades, thereby limiting our ability to respond to tenant demands. Existing or new regulatory policies, regulations or laws may materially and adversely affect the timing, cost or completion of our communications sites or result in changes in the competitive landscape that may negatively affect our business. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to litigants or result in decreased revenue. In addition, in certain jurisdictions, we and certain of our tenants are required to pay annual license fees, which may be subject to substantial increases by the government, or new fees may be enacted and applied retroactively. Governmental licenses may also be subject to periodic renewal and additional conditions to receive or maintain such license. Furthermore, the tax laws, regulations, applicable license terms and conditions, and interpretations governing our business, and that of our tenants, in jurisdictions where we operate may change at any time, potentially with retroactive effect. This includes changes in tax laws, spectrum use terms, administrative compliance guidance or judicial interpretations thereof. For example, the October 2019 Indian Supreme Court ruling regarding the definition of AGR and associated fees and charges may have a material financial impact on certain of our tenants which could affect their ability to perform their obligations 9 Table of Contents under agreements with us. Changes in laws, regulations and judicial decisions could have a more significant impact on us as a REIT relative to other REITs due to the nature of our business and our use of TRSs. These factors could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. Increasing competition within our industry may materially and adversely affect our revenue. Our industry is highly competitive and our tenants have numerous alternatives in leasing antenna space. Competition due to pricing or alternative contractual arrangements from peers could materially and adversely affect our lease rates. We may not be able to renew existing tenant leases or enter into new tenant leases, or if we are able to renew or enter into new leases, they may be at rates lower than our current rates or on less favorable terms than our current terms, resulting in an adverse impact on our results of operations and growth rate. In addition, should inflation rates exceed our fixed escalator percentages in markets where our leases include fixed escalators, our returns could be adversely affected. Our foreign operations are subject to economic, political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position, including risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Our international business operations and our potential expansion into additional new markets in the future expose us to potential adverse financial and operational problems not typically experienced in the United States. We anticipate that revenues from our international operations will continue to grow. Accordingly, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally, including: • uncertain, inconsistent or changing laws, regulations, rulings or methodologies impacting our existing and anticipated international operations, fees or other requirements directed specifically at the ownership and operation of communications sites or our international acquisitions, any of which laws, fees or requirements may be applied retroactively or with significant delay; • failure to retain our tax status or to obtain an expected tax status for which we have applied; • expropriation or governmental regulation restricting foreign ownership or requiring reversion or divestiture; • laws or regulations that tax or otherwise restrict repatriation of earnings or other funds or otherwise limit distributions of capital; • changes in a specific country’s or region’s political or economic conditions, including inflation or currency devaluation; • changes to zoning regulations or construction laws, which could be applied retroactively to our existing communications sites; • actions restricting or revoking our tenants’ spectrum licenses, or alterations or interpretations thereof, or suspending or terminating business under prior licenses; • failure to comply with anti-bribery laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar local anti-bribery laws, or the Office of Foreign Assets Control requirements; • failure to comply with data privacy laws or other protections of employee health and personal information; • material site issues related to security, fuel availability and reliability of electrical grids; • significant increases in, or implementation of new, license surcharges on our revenue; • loss of key personnel, including expatriates, in markets where talent is difficult or expensive to acquire; and • price-setting or other similar laws or regulations for the sharing of passive infrastructure. We also face risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, including those arising from our operations, investments and financing transactions related to our international business. Volatility in foreign currency exchange rates can also affect our ability to plan, forecast and budget for our international operations and expansion efforts. Our revenues earned from our international operations are primarily denominated in their respective local currencies. We have not historically engaged in significant currency hedging activities relating to our non-U.S. Dollar operations, and a weakening of these foreign currencies against the U.S. Dollar would negatively impact our reported revenues, operating profits and income. In addition, as we continue to invest in joint venture opportunities internationally, our partners may have business or economic goals that are inconsistent or conflict with ours, be in positions to take action contrary to our interests, policies or objectives, have competing interests in our, or other, markets that could create conflict of interest issues, withhold consents contrary to our requests or become unable or unwilling to fulfill their commitments, any of which could expose us to additional liabilities or costs, including requiring us to assume and fulfill the obligations of that joint venture or to execute buyouts of their interests. Our expansion and innovation initiatives involve a number of risks and uncertainties, including those related to integrating acquired or leased assets, that could adversely affect our operating results, disrupt our operations or expose us to additional risk. 10 Table of Contents As we continue to acquire and build communications sites and other communications infrastructure assets in our existing markets and expand into new markets, we are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including not meeting our return on investment criteria and financial objectives, increased costs, assumed liabilities and the diversion of managerial attention. Achieving the benefits of acquisition and innovation activities depends in part on timely and efficient integration of operations, telecommunications infrastructure assets and personnel. Integration may be difficult and unpredictable for many reasons, including, among other things, portfolios without requisite permits, differing systems, cultural differences, conflicting policies, procedures and operations. Significant acquisition-related integration costs, including certain nonrecurring charges such as costs associated with onboarding employees, integrating information technology systems, acquiring permits and visiting, inspecting, engineering and upgrading tower sites or related communications infrastructure assets, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in the period in which such charges are recorded or our cash flow in the period in which any related costs are actually paid. Some of our acquired tower portfolios have included sites that do not meet our structural specifications, including sites that may be overburdened. In these cases, in addition to additional capital expenditures, general liability risks associated with such towers will exist until such time as those towers are upgraded or otherwise remedied. In addition, integration may significantly burden management and internal resources, including through the potential loss or unavailability of key personnel. If we fail to successfully integrate the assets we acquire or fail to utilize such assets to their full capacity, we may not realize the benefits we expect from our acquired portfolios, and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. Our international expansion initiatives are subject to additional risks such as those described above. As a result of acquisitions, we have a substantial amount of intangible assets and goodwill. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”), we are required to assess our goodwill and other intangible assets annually or more frequently in the event of circumstances indicating potential impairment to determine if they are impaired. If, as a result of the factors noted above, the testing performed indicates that an asset may not be recoverable, we are required to record a non-cash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets and the implied fair value of the goodwill or the estimated fair value of other intangible assets in the period the determination is made. Our expansion and innovation initiatives may not be successful, or we may be required to record impairment charges for our goodwill or for other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. New technologies or changes in our or a tenant’s business model could make our tower leasing business less desirable and result in decreasing revenues and operating results. The development and implementation of new technologies designed to enhance the efficiency of wireless networks or changes in a tenant’s business model could reduce the need for tower-based wireless services, decrease demand for tower space or reduce previously obtainable lease rates. In addition, if the industry trends toward deploying increased capital to the development and implementation of new technologies, then tenants may allocate less of their budgets to leasing space on our towers. Examples of these technologies include more spectrally efficient technologies, which could relieve a portion of our tenants’ network capacity needs and, as a result, could reduce the demand for tower-based antenna space. Additionally, certain small cell complementary network technologies or satellite services could shift a portion of our tenants’ network investments away from traditional tower-based networks, which may reduce the need for carriers to add more equipment at certain communications sites. Moreover, the emergence of alternative technologies could reduce the need for tower-based broadcast services transmission and reception. Further, a tenant may decide to cease outsourcing tower infrastructure or otherwise change its business model, which would result in a decrease in our revenue and operating results. Our failure to innovate in response to the development and implementation of these or other new technologies or changes in a tenant’s business model could have a material adverse effect on the growth of our business, results of operations or financial condition. Conversely, we may invest significant capital in technologies, innovation projects or new additions to our core business that may not provide expected returns or profitability, which could divert management attention and have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Competition for assets could adversely affect our ability to achieve our return on investment criteria. We may experience increased competition for the acquisition of assets or contracts to build new communications sites for tenants, which could make the acquisition of high-quality assets significantly more costly or prohibitive or cause us to lose contracts to build new sites. Some of our competitors are larger and may have greater financial resources than we do, while other competitors may apply less stringent investment criteria than we do. In addition, we may not anticipate increased competition entering a particular market or competing for the same assets. Higher prices for assets or the failure to add new assets to our portfolio could make it more difficult to achieve our anticipated returns on investment or future growth, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. 11 Table of Contents Our leverage and debt service obligations may materially and adversely affect our ability to raise additional financing to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives and to satisfy our distribution requirements. Our leverage and debt service obligations could have significant negative consequences to our business, results of operations or financial condition, including: • requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our debt, thereby reducing the amount of our cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures and REIT distributions; • impairing our ability to meet one or more of the financial ratio covenants contained in our debt agreements or to generate cash sufficient to pay interest or principal due under those agreements, which could result in an acceleration of some or all of our outstanding debt and the loss of the towers securing such debt if a default remains uncured; • limiting our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing, thereby placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitors and competitors that may have better access to capital resources, including with respect to acquiring assets; and • limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the markets in which we compete. We may need to raise additional capital through debt financing activities, asset sales or equity issuances, even if the then-prevailing market conditions are not favorable, to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, required purchases of our joint venture partners’ interests and to satisfy our distribution requirements and debt service obligations. An increase in our total leverage could lead to a downgrade of our credit rating below investment grade, which could negatively impact our ability to access credit markets or preclude us from obtaining funds on investment grade terms, rates and conditions or subject us to additional loan covenants, which could accelerate our debt repayment obligations. Further, certain of our current debt instruments limit the amount of indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may incur. Additional financing, therefore, may be unavailable, more expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness. We may be adversely affected by changes in LIBOR reporting practices, the method in which LIBOR is determined or the use of alternative reference rates. In July 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”), which regulates the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), announced plans to phase out LIBOR rates by the end of 2021. As contemplated, the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot be assured after 2021, and LIBOR may cease to exist or otherwise be unsuitable for benchmarking. While our bank facilities contain fallback provisions to establish an alternative rate in the event LIBOR is unavailable, the elimination of LIBOR could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Financial institutions may replace LIBOR with a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate; however, no consensus exists as to what may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, whether LIBOR rates will cease to be published or supported before or after 2021 or whether any additional reforms to LIBOR may be enacted in the United Kingdom or elsewhere. Furthermore, the use of an alternative rate could result in increased costs, including increased interest expense, and increased borrowing and hedging costs in the future. We cannot predict the effect of the FCA’s decision not to sustain LIBOR or, if changes ultimately are made to LIBOR, the effect those changes may have on our interest expense related to borrowings under our bank facilities, certain other debt service obligations and interest swap agreements, which could potentially negatively impact our financial condition. If we fail to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT, we will be subject to tax at corporate income tax rates, which may substantially reduce funds otherwise available, and even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may face tax liabilities that impact earnings and available cash flow. Commencing with the taxable year beginning January 1, 2012, we have operated as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. Qualification for taxation as a REIT requires the application of certain highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), which provisions may change from time to time, to our operations as well as various factual determinations concerning matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. Further, tax legislation may adversely affect our ability to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT or the benefits or desirability of remaining so qualified. There are few judicial or administrative interpretations of the relevant provisions of the Code. If, in any taxable year, we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT and are not entitled to relief under the Code: • we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders and would be subject to federal and state income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates, which could be substantial in amount, and may require us to borrow additional funds or liquidate some investments to pay any additional tax liability and, accordingly, may reduce funds available for other purposes; and 12 Table of Contents • we will be disqualified from REIT tax treatment for the four taxable years immediately following the year during which we were so disqualified. We are subject to certain federal, state, local and foreign taxes on our income and assets, including taxes on any undistributed income and state, local or foreign income, franchise, property and transfer taxes. While state and local income tax regimes often parallel the U.S. federal income tax regime for REITs, many of these jurisdictions differ in their treatment of REITs. For example, some state and local jurisdictions currently or in the future may limit or eliminate a REIT’s deduction for dividends paid, which could increase our income tax expense. We are also subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and state, local and foreign tax authorities. The results of an audit and examination of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures may have an adverse effect on our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability. Furthermore, we have owned and may from time to time own direct and indirect ownership interests in subsidiary REITs, which must also comply with the same REIT requirements that we must satisfy, together with all other rules applicable to REITs. If the subsidiary REIT is determined to have failed to qualify for taxation as a REIT and certain relief provisions do not apply, then the subsidiary REIT would be subject to federal income tax, which tax we would economically bear along with applicable penalties and interest. In addition, our ownership of shares in such subsidiary REIT would fail to be a qualifying asset for purposes of the asset tests applicable to REITs and any dividend income or gains derived by us from such subsidiary REIT may cease to be treated as income that qualifies for purposes of the 75% gross income test. These consequences could have a material adverse effect on our ability to comply with the REIT income and asset tests, and thus our ability to qualify for taxation as a REIT. Complying with REIT requirements may limit our flexibility or cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities. Our use of TRSs enables us to engage in non-REIT qualifying business activities. Under the Code, no more than 20% of the value of the assets of a REIT may be represented by securities of one or more TRSs and no more than 25% of the value of the assets of the REIT may be represented by non-qualifying assets (including securities of one or more TRSs). This limitation may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments or take advantage of acquisition opportunities, including the purchase of non-qualifying assets, the expansion of non-real estate activities and investments in the businesses to be conducted by our TRSs, and to that extent limit our opportunities and our flexibility to change our business strategy. Further, as a REIT, we must distribute to our stockholders an amount equal to at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain). To meet our annual distribution requirements, we may be required to distribute amounts that may otherwise be used for our operations, including amounts that may otherwise be invested in future acquisitions, capital expenditures or repayment of debt. As no more than 25% of our gross income may consist of dividend income from our TRSs and other non-qualifying types of income, our ability to receive distributions from our TRSs may be limited, which may impact our ability to fund distributions to our stockholders or to use income of our TRSs to fund other investments. In addition, the majority of our income and cash flows from our TRSs are generated from our international operations. In many cases, there are local withholding taxes and currency controls that may impact our ability or willingness to repatriate funds to the United States to help satisfy REIT distribution requirements. Our towers, fiber networks, data centers or computer systems may be affected by natural disasters, security breaches and other unforeseen events for which our insurance may not provide adequate coverage. Our towers, fiber networks, data centers and computer systems are subject to risks associated with natural disasters, such as hurricanes, ice and wind storms, tornadoes, floods, earthquakes and wildfires, as well as other unforeseen events, such as acts of terrorism. During the past several years, we have seen an increase in severe weather events and expect this trend to continue due to climate change. Climate change or efforts to regulate emissions may also have direct or indirect effects on our business by increasing the cost of emission compliance or fuel we need to deliver primary power to our tenants under our contractual obligations, typically through diesel-powered generators, in emerging markets. Further, any damage or destruction to, or inability to access, our towers, fiber networks, data centers or computer systems may impact our ability to provide services to our tenants and lead to tenant loss, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. As part of our normal business activities and in our innovation or managed networks businesses, we rely on information technology and other computing resources. Our computer systems, network operation centers or power systems, or those of our cloud or Internet-based providers, could fail on their own accord and are subject to interruption or damage from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches (including through cyber-attack and data theft), usage errors, catastrophic events such as natural disasters and other events beyond our control. Although we and our vendors have disaster recovery programs and security measures in place, if our computer systems and our backup systems are compromised, degraded, damaged, breached or otherwise cease to function properly, we could suffer interruptions in our 13 Table of Contents operations, including our ability to correctly record, process and report financial information, our tenants’ network availability may be impacted or we could unintentionally allow misappropriation of proprietary or confidential information (including information about our tenants or landlords, or tenant information on our innovation or managed networks businesses), which could result in a loss of revenue, damage our reputation, litigation, penalties under existing or future data privacy laws and require us to incur significant costs to remediate or otherwise resolve these issues. In addition, our recent acquisitions, including acquisitions of fiber businesses, may increase our exposure to the risks described above and have material and adverse effects on our business. While we maintain insurance coverage for natural disasters, business interruption and cybersecurity, we may not have adequate insurance to cover the associated costs of repair or reconstruction of sites or fiber for a major future event, lost revenue, including from new tenants that could have been added to our towers, fiber networks or data centers but for the event, or other costs to remediate the impact of a significant event. Further, we may be liable for damage caused by towers that collapse for any number of reasons including structural deficiencies, which could harm our reputation and require us to incur costs for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage. Restrictive covenants in the agreements related to our securitization transactions, our credit facilities and our debt securities could materially and adversely affect our business by limiting flexibility, and we may be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock, which may jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a REIT. The agreements related to our securitization transactions include operating covenants and other restrictions customary for loans subject to rated securitizations. Among other things, the borrowers under the agreements are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets. A failure to comply with the covenants in the agreements could prevent the borrowers from taking certain actions with respect to the secured assets and could prevent the borrowers from distributing any excess cash from the operation of such assets to us. If the borrowers were to default on any of the loans, the servicer on such loan could seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of the secured assets, in which case we could lose such assets and the cash flow associated with such assets. The agreements for our credit facilities also contain restrictive covenants and leverage and other financial maintenance tests that could limit our ability to take various actions, including incurring additional debt, guaranteeing indebtedness or making distributions to stockholders, including our required REIT distributions, and engaging in various types of transactions, including mergers, acquisitions and sales of assets. Additionally, our debt agreements restrict our and our subsidiaries’ ability to incur liens securing our or their indebtedness. These covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, new tower development, mergers and acquisitions or other opportunities. Further, reporting and information covenants in our credit agreements and indentures require that we provide financial and operating information within certain time periods. If we are unable to provide the required information on a timely basis, we would be in breach of these covenants. For more information regarding the covenants and requirements discussed above, please see Item 7 of this Annual Report under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Factors Affecting Sources of Liquidity” and note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. We also enter into hedges for certain debt instruments, which may have an adverse impact on our results to the extent that the counterparties do not perform as expected at the inception of each hedge. Our costs could increase and our revenues could decrease due to perceived health risks from radio emissions, especially if these perceived risks are substantiated. Public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and other wireless communications technology could slow the growth of wireless companies, which could in turn slow our growth. In particular, negative public perception of, and regulations regarding, these perceived health risks could undermine the market acceptance of wireless communications services and increase opposition to the development and expansion of tower sites. If a scientific study, court decision or government agency ruling resulted in a finding that radio frequency emissions pose health risks to consumers, it could negatively impact our tenants and the market for wireless services, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. We do not maintain any significant insurance with respect to these matters. We could have liability under environmental and occupational safety and health laws. Our operations are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations, including those relating to the management, use, storage, disposal, emission and remediation of, and exposure to, hazardous and non-hazardous substances, materials and wastes. As the owner, lessee or operator of real property and facilities, including generators, we may be liable for substantial costs of investigation, removal or remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous materials, and for damages and costs relating to off-site migration of hazardous materials, without regard to whether we, as the owner, lessee or operator, knew of, or were responsible for, the contamination. 14 Table of Contents We may also be liable for certain costs of remediating contamination at third-party sites to which we sent waste for disposal, even if the original disposal may have complied with all legal requirements at the time. Many of these laws and regulations contain information reporting and record keeping requirements. We may not be at all times in compliance with all environmental requirements. We may be subject to potentially significant fines or penalties if we fail to comply with any of these requirements. The requirements of the environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and could become more stringent in the future. In certain jurisdictions these laws and regulations could be applied retroactively or be broadened to cover situations or persons not currently considered. It is possible that these requirements will change or that liabilities will arise in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. While we maintain environmental and workers’ compensation insurance, we may not have adequate insurance to cover all costs, fines or penalties. If we are unable to protect our rights to the land under our towers, it could adversely affect our business and operating results. Our real property interests relating to our towers consist primarily of leasehold and sub-leasehold interests, fee interests, easements, licenses and rights-of-way. A loss of these interests at a particular tower site may interfere with our ability to operate that tower site and generate revenues. For various reasons, we may not always have the ability to access, analyze and verify all information regarding titles and other issues prior to completing an acquisition of communications sites, which can affect our rights to access and operate a site. From time to time, we also experience disputes with landowners regarding the terms of easements or ground agreements for land under towers, which can affect our ability to access and operate tower sites. Further, for various reasons, landowners may not want to renew their ground agreements with us, they may lose their rights to the land, or they may transfer their land interests to third parties, including ground lease aggregators, which could affect our ability to renew ground agreements on commercially viable terms. A significant number of the communications sites in our portfolio are located on land we lease pursuant to long-term operating leases. Further, for various reasons, title to property interests in some of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate may not be as certain as title to our property interests in the United States. Our inability to protect our rights to the land under our towers may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. If we are unable or choose not to exercise our rights to purchase towers that are subject to lease and sublease agreements at the end of the applicable period, our cash flows derived from those towers will be eliminated. Our communications real estate portfolio includes towers that we operate pursuant to lease and sublease agreements that include a purchase option at the end of the lease period. We may not have the required available capital to exercise our right to purchase the towers at the end of the applicable period, or we may choose, for business or other reasons, not to do so. If we do not exercise these purchase rights, and are unable to extend the lease or sublease or otherwise acquire an interest that would allow us to continue to operate these towers after the applicable period, we will lose the cash flows derived from the towers. If we decide to exercise these purchase rights, the benefits of acquiring a significant number of towers may not exceed the associated acquisition, compliance and integration costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. 15 Table of Contents ITEM 2. PROPERTIES As of December 31, 2019 , we owned and operated a portfolio of 179,520 communications sites, including 1,774 DAS networks. See the table in Item 7 of this Annual Report, under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Executive Overview” for more detailed information on the geographic locations of our communications sites. In addition, we own property interests that we lease to communications service providers and third-party tower operators in the United States, which are included in our U.S. property segment. Our interests in our communications sites consist of a variety of ownership interests, including leases created by long-term ground lease agreements, easements, licenses or rights-of-way granted by government entities. A typical tower site consists of a compound enclosing the tower site, a tower structure and, in some cases, one or more equipment shelters that house a variety of transmitting, receiving and switching equipment. In addition, many of our international sites typically include power generators and batteries, which are often used for primary power in lieu of an electric grid connection in select markets. The principal types of our towers are guyed, self-supporting lattice and monopole, and rooftop towers in our international markets. • A guyed tower includes a series of cables attaching separate levels of the tower to anchor foundations in the ground and can reach heights of up to 2,000 feet. A typical guyed broadcast tower can be located a tract of land of up to 20 acres. • A self-supporting lattice tower typically tapers from the bottom up and usually has three or four legs. A lattice tower can reach heights of up to 1,000 feet, although most lattice structures are between 200 and 400 feet. Depending on the height of the tower, a lattice tower site can be located on a tract of land of 10,000 square feet for a rural site or fewer than 2,500 square feet for a metropolitan site. • A monopole tower is a tubular structure that is used primarily to address space constraints or aesthetic concerns. Monopoles typically have heights ranging from 50 to 200 feet. A monopole tower site used in metropolitan areas for a typical wireless communications tower can be located on a tract of land of fewer than 2,500 square feet. • Rooftop towers are primarily used in metropolitan areas in our Asia, Africa, Europe and Latin America markets, where locations for traditional tower structures are unavailable. Rooftop towers typically have heights ranging from 10 to 100 feet. U.S. Property Segment Encumbered Sites . As of December 31, 2019 , the loan underlying the securitization transactions completed in March 2013 and March 2018 (the “2013 Securitization” and the “2018 Securitization”, respectively, and together, the “Trust Securitizations”) is secured by mortgages, deeds of trust and deeds to secure the loan on substantially all of the 5,114 broadcast and wireless communications towers and related assets owned by the borrowers (the “Trust Sites”) and the secured revenue notes issued in a private transaction completed in May 2015 (the “2015 Securitization”) are secured by mortgages, deeds of trust and deeds to secure debt on substantially all of the 3,542 communications sites owned by subsidiaries of the issuer (the “2015 Secured Sites”). Asia Property Segment Encumbered Sites. There are no encumbered sites in our Asia property segment. Africa Property Segment Encumbered Sites. Our outstanding indebtedness in South Africa is secured by an aggregate of 1,899 towers. Europe Property Segment Encumbered Sites. There are no encumbered sites in our Europe property segment. Latin America Property Segment Encumbered Sites . Our outstanding indebtedness in Brazil is secured by an aggregate of 760 towers and outstanding indebtedness in Colombia is secured by an aggregate of 3,563 towers. Ground Leases. Of the 177,746 towers in our portfolio as of December 31, 2019 , approximately 90% were located on land we lease. Typically, we seek to enter long-term ground leases, which have initial terms of approximately five to ten years with one or more automatic or exercisable renewal periods. As a result, 43% of the ground leases for our sites have a final expiration date of 2029 and beyond. Tenants . Our tenants are primarily wireless service providers, broadcasters and other companies in a variety of industries. For the year ended December 31, 2019 , our top four tenants by total revenue were AT&T ( 22% ), Verizon Wireless ( 15% ), T-Mobile ( 10% ) and Sprint ( 8% ). Across most of our markets, our tenant leases generally have initial non-cancellable terms of five to ten years with multiple renewal terms. As a result, approximately 65% of our current tenant leases have a renewal date of 2025 or beyond. 16 Table of Contents Offices. Our principal corporate headquarters is leased and located in Boston, Massachusetts, where we currently lease approximately 40,000 square feet of office space. We also own or have entered into long-term leases for the majority of our facilities in international and regional locations for the management and operation of our property and services businesses, including offices in each of our U.S., Asia, Africa, Europe and Latin America segments. We believe that our owned and leased facilities are suitable and adequate to meet our anticipated needs. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS We periodically become involved in various claims and lawsuits that are incidental to our business. In the opinion of management, after consultation with counsel, there are no matters currently pending that would, in the event of an adverse outcome, have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Our common stock is listed on the NYSE under the ticker symbol AMT. As of February 18, 2020 , we had 442,911,804 outstanding shares of common stock and 151 registered holders. Dividends As a REIT, we must annually distribute to our stockholders an amount equal to at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain). Generally, we have distributed and expect to continue to distribute all or substantially all of our REIT taxable income after taking into consideration our utilization of net operating losses ( “ NOLs ” ). The amount, timing and frequency of future distributions will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon various factors, a number of which may be beyond our control, including our financial condition and operating cash flows, the amount required to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT and reduce any income and excise taxes that we otherwise would be required to pay, limitations on distributions in our existing and future debt and preferred equity instruments, our ability to utilize NOLs to offset our distribution requirements, limitations on our ability to fund distributions using cash generated through our TRSs and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations that follow are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences could be material to the financial statements. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report and the accompanying notes, and the information set forth under the caption “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” below. During the fourth quarter of 2019, as a result of recent acquisitions, including the Eaton Towers Acquisition, and changes to our organizational structure, we reviewed and changed our reportable segments to divide our EMEA segment into two separate segments, Africa property and Europe property. We now report our results in six segments – U.S. property, Asia property, Africa property, Europe property, Latin America property and services. We believe this change provides more visibility into these operating segments and better aligns our reporting with management’s current approach of allocating costs and resources, managing growth and profitability and assessing the operating performance of our business segments. In evaluating financial performance in each business segment, management uses, among other factors, segment gross margin and segment operating profit (see note 21 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report). The change in reportable segments has no impact on our consolidated financial statements for any periods. Historical financial information included in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations has been adjusted to reflect the change in reportable segments. Executive Overview We are one of the largest global REITs and a leading independent owner, operator and developer of multitenant communications real estate. Our primary business is the leasing of space on communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, wireless data providers, government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries. In addition to the communications sites in our portfolio, we manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements. We also hold other telecommunications infrastructure, fiber and property interests that we lease primarily to communications service providers and third-party tower operators. We refer to this business as our property operations, which accounted for 98% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 and includes our U.S. property, Asia property, Africa property, Europe property and Latin America property segments. We also offer tower-related services in the United States, including site acquisition, zoning and permitting and structural analysis, which primarily support our site leasing business, including the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites. 22 Table of Contents The following table details the number of communications sites, excluding managed sites, that we owned or operated as of December 31, 2019 : Number of Owned Towers Number of Operated Towers (1) Number of Owned DAS Sites Domestic: United States 25,003 15,564 407 Asia: India (2) 73,633 — 1,079 Africa Burkina Faso 664 — — Ghana 3,157 665 27 Kenya 2,060 — 9 Niger 677 — — Nigeria 5,207 — — South Africa (2) 2,711 — — Uganda 3,181 — 12 Africa total 17,657 665 48 Europe France 2,207 309 9 Germany 2,211 — — Europe total 4,418 309 9 Latin America: Argentina (3) 94 — 10 Brazil (3) 16,706 2,258 103 Chile 2,583 — 22 Colombia 5,005 — 2 Costa Rica 621 — 2 Mexico (4) 9,427 187 92 Paraguay 1,420 — — Peru 1,792 404 — Latin America total 37,648 2,849 231 _______________ (1) Approximately 95% of the operated towers are held pursuant to long-term finance leases, including those subject to purchase options. (2) In India and South Africa, we also own fiber. (3) In Argentina and Brazil, we also own or operate urban telecommunications assets, including fiber, and the rights to utilize certain existing utility infrastructure for future telecommunications equipment installation. (4) In Mexico, we also own or operate urban telecommunications assets, including fiber, concrete poles and other infrastructure. In most of our markets, our tenant leases with wireless carriers generally have initial non-cancellable terms of five to ten years with multiple renewal terms. Accordingly, the vast majority of the revenue generated by our property operations during the year ended December 31, 2019 was recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. Based upon foreign currency exchange rates and the tenant leases in place as of December 31, 2019 , we expect to generate nearly $46.9 billion of non-cancellable tenant lease revenue over future periods, before the impact of straight-line lease accounting. Most of our tenant leases have provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease, typically based on an annual fixed escalation (averaging approximately 3% in the United States) or an inflationary index in our international markets, or a combination of both. In addition, certain of our tenant leases provide for additional revenue primarily to cover costs, such as ground rent or power and fuel costs. The revenues generated by our property operations may be affected by cancellations of existing tenant leases. As discussed above, most of our tenant leases with wireless carriers and broadcasters are multiyear contracts, which typically are non-cancellable; however, in some instances, a lease may be cancelled upon the payment of a termination fee. Revenue lost from either tenant lease cancellations or the non-renewal of leases or rent renegotiations, which we refer to as churn, has historically not had a material adverse effect on the revenues generated by our consolidated property operations. 23 Table of Contents During the year ended December 31, 2019 , churn was approximately 6% of our tenant billings. The higher than historical level of churn was largely due to carrier consolidation events in India. Beginning in late 2017, we experienced an increase in revenue lost from cancellations or non-renewals primarily due to carrier consolidation-driven churn in India, which compressed our gross margin and operating profit, particularly in our Asia property segment, although this impact was partially offset by lower expenses due to reduced tenancy on existing sites and the decommissioning of certain sites. We anticipate that our churn rate in India will move closer to historical levels over time and result in reduced impacts on our property revenue, gross margin and operating profit. In the immediate term, we expect that our churn rate will remain elevated, primarily due the uncertainty created by the recent court ruling by the Indian Supreme Court, as set forth in Item 1A of this Annual Report under under the captions “Risk Factors—A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of tenants, and we are sensitive to adverse changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our tenants” and “Risk Factors—Our business, and that of our tenants, is subject to laws, regulations and administrative and judicial decisions, and changes thereto, that could restrict our ability to operate our business as we currently do or impact our competitive landscape.” We expect to periodically evaluate the carrying value of our Indian assets, which may result in the realization of additional impairment expense or other similar charges. For more information, please see the information under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.” For the year ended December 31, 2019 , aggregate carrier consolidation in India negatively impacted our consolidated property revenue by $361.3 million, including approximately $84.2 million in pass-through revenue, and negatively impacted our gross margin and operating profit by $247.7 million. Property Operations Revenue Growth . Due to our diversified communications site portfolio, our tenant lease rates vary considerably depending upon numerous factors, including, but not limited to, amount, type and position of tenant equipment on the tower, remaining tower capacity and tower location. We measure the remaining tower capacity by assessing several factors, including tower height, tower type, environmental conditions, existing equipment on the tower and zoning and permitting regulations in effect in the jurisdiction where the tower is located. In many instances, tower capacity can be increased with relatively modest tower augmentation capital expenditures. The primary factors affecting the revenue growth of our property segments are: • Growth in tenant billings, including: • New revenue attributable to leases in place on day one on sites acquired or constructed since the beginning of the prior-year period; • New revenue attributable to leasing additional space on our sites (“colocations”) and lease amendments; and • Contractual rent escalations on existing tenant leases, net of churn. • Revenue growth from other items, including additional tenant payments primarily to cover costs, such as ground rent or power and fuel costs included in certain tenant leases (“pass-through”), straight-line revenue and decommissioning. We continue to believe that our site leasing revenue is likely to increase due to the growing use of wireless services globally and our ability to meet the corresponding incremental demand for our communications real estate. By adding new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our sites, we are able to increase these sites’ utilization and profitability. We believe the majority of our site leasing activity will continue to come from wireless service providers, with tenants in a number of other industries contributing incremental leasing demand. Our site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with new business opportunities, which have historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth as wireless carriers seek to increase the coverage and capacity of their existing networks, while also deploying next generation wireless technologies. In addition, we intend to continue to supplement our organic growth by selectively developing or acquiring new sites in our existing and new markets where we can achieve our risk-adjusted return on investment objectives. Property Operations Organic Revenue Growth . Consistent with our strategy to increase the utilization and return on investment from our sites, our objective is to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants through colocation and lease amendments. Our ability to lease additional space on our sites is primarily a function of the rate at which wireless carriers and other tenants deploy capital to improve and expand their wireless networks. This rate, in turn, is influenced by the growth of wireless services, the penetration of advanced wireless devices, the level of emphasis on network quality and capacity in carrier competition, the financial performance of our tenants and their access to capital and general economic conditions. According to industry data, recent aggregate annual wireless capital spending in the United States has averaged approximately $30.0 billion, resulting in consistent demand for our sites. 24 Table of Contents Based on industry research and projections, we expect that a number of key industry trends will result in incremental revenue opportunities for us: • In less advanced wireless markets where initial voice and data networks are still being deployed, we expect these deployments to drive demand for our tower space as carriers seek to expand their footprints and increase the scope and density of their networks. We have established operations in many of these markets at the early stages of wireless development, which we believe will enable us to meaningfully participate in these deployments over the long term. • Subscribers’ use of mobile data continues to grow rapidly given increasing smartphone and other advanced device penetration, the proliferation of bandwidth-intensive applications on these devices and the continuing evolution of the mobile ecosystem. We believe carriers will be compelled to deploy additional equipment on existing networks while also rolling out more advanced wireless networks to address coverage and capacity needs resulting from this increasing mobile data usage. • The deployment of advanced mobile technology, such as 4G and 5G, across existing wireless networks will provide higher speed data services and further enable fixed broadband substitution. As a result, we expect that our tenants will continue deploying additional equipment across their existing networks. • Wireless service providers compete based on the quality of their existing networks, which is driven by capacity and coverage. To maintain or improve their network performance as overall network usage increases, our tenants continue deploying additional equipment across their existing sites while also adding new cell sites. We anticipate increasing network densification over the next several years, as existing network infrastructure is anticipated to be insufficient to account for rapidly increasing levels of wireless data usage. • Wireless service providers continue to acquire additional spectrum, and as a result are expected to add additional sites and equipment to their networks as they seek to optimize their network configuration and utilize additional spectrum. • Next generation technologies requiring wireless connectivity have the potential to provide incremental revenue opportunities for us. These technologies may include autonomous vehicle networks and a number of other internet-of-things, or IoT, applications, as well as other potential use cases for wireless services. These technologies may create new and complementary use cases for our communications real estate over time, although these use cases are currently in nascent stages. As part of our international expansion initiatives, we have targeted markets in various stages of network development to diversify our international exposure and position us to benefit from a number of different wireless technology deployments over the long term. In addition, we have focused on building relationships with large multinational carriers to increase the opportunities for growth or mutually beneficial transactional opportunities across common markets. We believe that consistent carrier network investments across our international markets will, over the long term, position us to generate meaningful organic revenue growth going forward. In emerging markets, such as Burkina Faso, Ghana, India, Kenya, Niger, Nigeria and Uganda, wireless networks tend to be significantly less advanced than those in the United States, and initial voice networks continue to be deployed in certain underdeveloped areas. A majority of consumers in these markets still utilize basic wireless services, predominantly on feature phones, while advanced device penetration remains low. In more developed urban locations within these markets, data network deployments are underway. Carriers are focused on completing voice network build-outs while also investing in initial data networks as mobile data usage and smartphone penetration within their customer bases begin to accelerate. In India, the ongoing transition from 2G technology to 4G technology has included a period of carrier consolidation, whereby the number of carriers operating in the marketplace has been reduced through mergers, acquisitions and select carrier exits from the marketplace, which we believe is now substantially complete. We believe that this consolidation process has resulted in an industry structure for both the wireless carriers and communications infrastructure providers that is expected to be more conducive to sustained growth and profitability over time. In markets with rapidly evolving network technology, such as South Africa and most of the countries in Latin America where we do business, initial voice networks, for the most part, have already been built out, and carriers are increasingly focused on 4G network build outs, with certain continuing legacy investments in 3G. Consumers in these regions are increasingly adopting smartphones and other advanced devices, in particular as lower cost smartphones become increasingly available. As a result, the usage of bandwidth-intensive mobile applications is growing materially. Recent spectrum auctions in these rapidly evolving markets have allowed incumbent carriers to accelerate their data network deployments and have also enabled new entrants to begin initial investments in data networks. Smartphone penetration and wireless data usage in these markets are advancing rapidly, which typically requires that carriers continue to invest in their networks to maintain and augment their quality of service. 25 Table of Contents Finally, in markets with more mature network technology, such as Germany and France, carriers are focused on deploying 4G data networks to account for rapidly increasing wireless data usage among their customer base. With higher smartphone and advanced device penetration and significantly higher per capita data usage, carrier investment in networks is focused on 4G coverage and capacity. We believe that the network technology migration we have seen in the United States, which has led to significantly denser networks and meaningful new business commencements for us over a number of years, will be replicated in our less advanced international markets over time. As a result, we expect to be able to leverage our extensive international portfolio of approximately 138,545 communications sites and the relationships we have built with our carrier tenants to drive sustainable, long - term growth. We have master lease agreements with certain of our tenants that provide for consistent, long-term revenue and reduce the likelihood of churn. Certain of those master lease agreements are holistic in nature and further build and augment strong strategic partnerships with our tenants and have significantly reduced colocation cycle times, thereby providing our tenants with the ability to rapidly and efficiently deploy equipment on our sites. Demand for our communications sites could be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including an increase in network sharing or consolidation among our tenants, as set forth in Item 1A of this Annual Report under the captions “Risk Factors—If our tenants consolidate their operations, exit the telecommunications business or share site infrastructure to a significant degree, our growth, revenue and ability to generate positive cash flows could be materially and adversely affected” and “Risk Factors—A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of tenants, and we are sensitive to adverse changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our tenants.” In addition, the emergence and growth of new technologies could reduce demand for our sites, as set forth under the caption “Risk Factors—New technologies or changes in our or a tenant’s business model could make our tower leasing business less desirable and result in decreasing revenues and operating results.” Further, our tenants may be subject to new regulatory policies from time to time that materially and adversely affect the demand for our communications sites. Property Operations New Site Revenue Growth. During the year ended December 31, 2019 , we grew our portfolio of communications real estate through the acquisition and construction of approximately 13,705 sites globally. In a majority of our Asia, Africa, Europe and Latin America markets, the revenue generated from newly acquired or constructed sites resulted in increases in both tenant and pass-through revenues (such as ground rent or power and fuel costs) and expenses. We continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire communications real estate portfolios, both domestically and internationally, to determine whether they meet our risk-adjusted hurdle rates and whether we believe we can effectively integrate them into our existing portfolio. New Sites (Acquired or Constructed) 2019 2018 2017 U.S. 430 285 635 Asia 3,330 21,470 1,135 Africa 6,455 1,040 265 Europe 15 15 2,490 Latin America 3,475 1,655 2,360 Property Operations Expenses. Direct operating expenses incurred by our property segments include direct site level expenses and consist primarily of ground rent and power and fuel costs, some or all of which may be passed through to our tenants, as well as property taxes, repairs and maintenance. These segment direct operating expenses exclude all segment and corporate selling, general, administrative and development expenses, which are aggregated into one line item entitled Selling, general, administrative and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations. In general, our property segments’ selling, general, administrative and development expenses do not significantly increase as a result of adding incremental tenants to our sites and typically increase only modestly year-over-year. As a result, leasing additional space to new tenants on our sites provides significant incremental cash flow. We may, however, incur additional segment selling, general, administrative and development expenses as we increase our presence in our existing markets or expand into new markets. Our profit margin growth is therefore positively impacted by the addition of new tenants to our sites but can be temporarily diluted by our development activities. Services Segment Revenue Growth . As we continue to focus on growing our property operations, we anticipate that our services revenue will continue to represent a small percentage of our total revenues. Non-GAAP Financial Measures 26 Table of Contents Included in our analysis of our results of operations are discussions regarding earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and accretion, as adjusted (“Adjusted EBITDA”), Funds From Operations, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“Nareit FFO”) attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders, Consolidated Adjusted Funds From Operations (“Consolidated AFFO”) and AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders. We define Adjusted EBITDA as Net income before Income (loss) from equity method investments; Income tax benefit (provision); Other income (expense); Gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations; Interest expense; Interest income; Other operating income (expense); Depreciation, amortization and accretion; and stock-based compensation expense. Nareit FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders is defined as net income before gains or losses from the sale or disposal of real estate, real estate related impairment charges, real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion and dividends on preferred stock, and including adjustments for (i) unconsolidated affiliates and (ii) noncontrolling interests. In this section, we refer to Nareit FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders as “Nareit FFO (common stockholders).” We define Consolidated AFFO as Nareit FFO (common stockholders) before (i) straight-line revenue and expense; (ii) stock-based compensation expense; (iii) the deferred portion of income tax; (iv) non-real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion; (v) amortization of deferred financing costs, capitalized interest, debt discounts and premiums and long-term deferred interest charges; (vi) other income (expense); (vii) gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations; (viii) other operating income (expense); and adjustments for (ix) unconsolidated affiliates and (x) noncontrolling interests, less cash payments related to capital improvements and cash payments related to corporate capital expenditures. We define AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders as Consolidated AFFO, excluding the impact of noncontrolling interests on both Nareit FFO (common stockholders) and the other adjustments included in the calculation of Consolidated AFFO. In this section, we refer to AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders as “AFFO (common stockholders).” Adjusted EBITDA, Nareit FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO and AFFO (common stockholders) are not intended to replace net income or any other performance measures determined in accordance with GAAP. None of Adjusted EBITDA, Nareit FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO or AFFO (common stockholders) represents cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and, therefore, these measures should not be considered indicative of cash flows from operating activities, as a measure of liquidity or a measure of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. Rather, Adjusted EBITDA, Nareit FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO and AFFO (common stockholders) are presented as we believe each is a useful indicator of our current operating performance. We believe that these metrics are useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because (1) each is a key measure used by our management team for decision making purposes and for evaluating our operating segments’ performance; (2) Adjusted EBITDA is a component underlying our credit ratings; (3) Adjusted EBITDA is widely used in the telecommunications real estate sector to measure operating performance as depreciation, amortization and accretion may vary significantly among companies depending upon accounting methods and useful lives, particularly where acquisitions and non-operating factors are involved; (4) Consolidated AFFO is widely used in the telecommunications real estate sector to adjust Nareit FFO (common stockholders) for items that may otherwise cause material fluctuations in Nareit FFO (common stockholders) growth from period to period that would not be representative of the underlying performance of property assets in those periods; (5) each provides investors with a meaningful measure for evaluating our period-to-period operating performance by eliminating items that are not operational in nature; and (6) each provides investors with a measure for comparing our results of operations to those of other companies, particularly those in our industry. Our measurement of Adjusted EBITDA, Nareit FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO and AFFO (common stockholders) may not, however, be fully comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA, Nareit FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO and AFFO (common stockholders) to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, have been included below. 27 Table of Contents Results of Operations Years Ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 (in millions, except percentages) Revenue Year Ended December 31, Percent Change 2019 vs 2018 Percent Change 2018 vs 2017 2019 2018 2017 Property U.S. $ 4,188.7 $ 3,822.1 $ 3,605.7 10 % 6 % Asia 1,217.0 1,540.5 1,164.4 (21 ) 32 Africa 583.9 545.5 503.6 7 8 Europe 134.6 141.8 122.6 (5 ) 16 Latin America 1,340.7 1,264.8 1,169.6 6 8 Total property 7,464.9 7,314.7 6,565.9 2 11 Services 115.4 125.4 98.0 (8 ) 28 Total revenues $ 7,580.3 $ 7,440.1 $ 6,663.9 2 % 12 % Year ended December 31, 2019 U.S. property segment revenue growth of $366.6 million was attributable to: • Tenant billings growth of $276.5 million, which was driven by: • $206.1 million due to colocations and amendments; • $62.6 million from contractual escalations, net of churn; and • $14.2 million generated from newly acquired or constructed sites; • Partially offset by a decrease of $6.4 million from other tenant billings; and • An increase of $90.1 million in other revenue, which includes an $82.4 million increase due to straight-line accounting primarily due to entry into a new master lease agreement with one of our tenants, AT&T.

We record unrealized foreign currency gains or losses as a result of foreign currency fluctuations primarily associated with our intercompany notes and similar unaffiliated balances denominated in a currency other than the subsidiaries’ functional currencies. The increase in total other expense during the year ended December 31, 2019 was due to (i) a decrease in other income of $16.8 million, primarily due to the nonrecurrence of a gain of $9.7 million associated with the write-offs of the capital lease liability and Economic Rights Agreement and related amortization in conjunction with the note extinguishment with TV Azteca during the year ended December 31, 2018 and (ii) an increase in loss on retirement of long-term obligations of $18.9 million primarily due to a loss of $22.1 million, attributable to the repayment of the 5.050% senior unsecured notes due 2020 (the “5.050% Notes”). These items were partially offset by foreign currency gains of $6.1 million in the current period, compared to foreign currency losses of $4.5 million in the prior-year period and a decrease in net interest expense of $3.4 million. The increase in total other expense during the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily due to additional interest expense of $75.9 million due to a $2.0 billion increase in our average debt outstanding and foreign currency losses of $4.5 million in the current period, compared to foreign currency gains of $26.4 million in the prior-year period. The increase was partially offset by (i) a decrease in loss on retirement of long-term obligations of $66.9 million due to the nonrecurrence of a loss of $70.2 million recorded in the prior-year period attributable to the redemptions of the 7.25% senior unsecured notes due 2019 and the 4.500% senior unsecured notes due 2018 and the repayment of the Secured Cellular Site Revenue Notes, Series 2012-2 Class A, Series 2012-2 Class B and Series 2012-2 Class C and Secured Cellular Site Revenue Notes, Series 2010-2, Class C and Series 2010-2, Class F, (ii) an increase in other income of $23.4 million partially due to the write-offs of the capital lease liability and Economic Rights Agreement and related amortization in conjunction with the note extinguishment with TV Azteca and (iii) an additional $19.3 million in interest income, compared to the prior-year period.

In addition, we are able to offset certain income by utilizing our NOLs, subject to specified limitations. Consequently, the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations for each of the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 differs from the federal statutory rate. The decrease in the income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily attributable to an increase in foreign earnings subject to taxation in the current period, offset by a $113.0 million benefit arising from revaluing our net deferred tax liability due to tax law changes in India. The income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2018 was favorably impacted by certain events in India and a one-time benefit, discussed below. The change in the income tax (benefit) provision for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily attributable to a decrease in foreign earnings subject to taxation in the current period, primarily resulting from impairment charges and accelerated amortization in India, and a one-time benefit of $85.7 million related to the restructuring of international operations 34 Table of Contents in certain jurisdictions. The income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2017 was favorably impacted by a clarification in income tax law in Ghana.

(2) For the year ended December 31, 2019, amount includes a tax benefit of $113.0 million as a result of revaluing our net deferred tax liability due to tax law changes in India. For the year ended December 31, 2018, amount includes a tax benefit primarily attributable to the tax effect of an increase in impairment charges and a one-time benefit for restructuring-related activity in foreign jurisdictions offset by the nonrecurrence of prior-year benefit from a clarification in income tax law in Ghana. (3) Relates to the payment of capitalized interest associated with the shareholder loan previously owed to our joint venture partner in Ghana (see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report). This long-term deferred interest was previously expensed but excluded from Consolidated AFFO. (4) Includes (gains) losses on foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations of ($6.1 million), $4.5 million and ($26.4 million), respectively. (5) Primarily includes acquisition-related costs and integration costs. For the year ended December 31, 2019, amount also includes the receipt of $13.1 million related to pre-acquisition contingencies and settlements. For the year ended December 31, 2017, amount also includes refunds for acquisition costs and a charitable contribution. (6) Includes adjustments for the impact on both Nareit FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders as well as the other line items included in the calculation of Consolidated AFFO. Year Ended December 31, 2019 The increase in net income was primarily due to an increase in our operating profit, a decrease in other operating expenses, primarily related to a decrease in impairment charges of $299.8 million and a decrease in stock-based compensation expense, partially offset by a change in the income tax benefit and an increase in loss on retirement of long-term obligations of $18.9 million during the period, attributable to the repayment of the 5.050% Notes. 36 Table of Contents The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily attributable to the increase in our gross margin and was partially offset by an increase in SG&A, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense, of $22.8 million. The decrease in Consolidated AFFO was primarily the result of a decrease in our operating profit, excluding the impact of straight-line accounting, and increases in capital improvement and corporate capital expenditures, partially offset by a decrease in the income tax benefit net of deferred amounts and a decrease in dividends on preferred stock. The increase in AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders was attributable to lower adjustments for unconsolidated affiliates and noncontrolling interests primarily as a result of a decrease in the operating profit in our Asia property segment due to our October 2018 settlement with Tata, partially offset by the decrease in Consolidated AFFO described above. Year Ended December 31, 2018 The increase in net income was primarily due to an increase in our operating profit, the change in the income tax (benefit) provision and the nonrecurrence of a loss on retirement of long-term obligations of $70.2 million recorded in the prior-year period, partially offset by an increase in other operating expenses, primarily related to an increase in impairment charges of $182.6 million, and increases in depreciation, amortization and accretion expense and interest expense. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily attributable to the increase in our gross margin, partially offset by an increase in SG&A of $67.6 million, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense. The growth in Consolidated AFFO and AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders was primarily attributable to the increase in our operating profit, a decrease in dividends on preferred stock and a decrease in the adjustment for straight-line revenue, partially offset by increases in cash paid for interest, capital improvement capital expenditures and corporate SG&A. 37 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview During the year ended December 31, 2019 , we increased our financial flexibility and our ability to grow our business while maintaining our long-term financial policies. Our significant 2019 financing transactions included: • Unsecured $1.3 billion term loan due February 13, 2020 (the “2019 364-Day Term Loan”). • Registered public offerings in an aggregate amount of $4.9 billion of senior unsecured notes with maturities ranging from 2024 to 2049. • Redemptions of the 3.40% senior unsecured notes due 2019 (the “ 3.40% Notes”) and the 5.050% Notes for an aggregate amount of $1.7 billion . • Amendment and restatements of our multicurrency senior unsecured revolving credit facility entered into in June 2013, as amended (as amended and restated, the “2019 Multicurrency Credit Facility”), our senior unsecured revolving credit facility entered into in January 2012 and amended and restated in September 2014, as further amended (as amended and restated, the “2019 Credit Facility”) and our unsecured term loan entered into in October 2013, as amended (as amended and restated, the “2019 Term Loan”) to, among other things, (i) extend each of the maturity dates by one year to June 28, 2023, January 31, 2025 and January 31, 2025, respectively and (ii) increase the commitments under each of the 2019 Multicurrency Credit Facility and the 2019 Credit Facility to $3.0 billion and $2.25 billion , respectively. The following table summarizes our liquidity as of December 31, 2019 (in millions): Available under the 2019 Multicurrency Credit Facility $ 2,300.0 Available under the 2019 Credit Facility 650.0 Letters of credit (9.9 ) Total available under credit facilities, net 2,940.1 Cash and cash equivalents 1,501.2 Total liquidity $ 4,441.3 Subsequent to December 31, 2019 , we made net repayments of $600.0 million under the 2019 Credit Facility, including repayments of approximately $1,483.4 million using the proceeds from our issuance of the 2.400% Notes and 2.900% Notes (each as defined below), and made net borrowings of $271.8 million under the 2019 Multicurrency Credit Facility. The borrowings were used to repay existing indebtedness and for general corporate purposes. Summary cash flow information is set forth below for the years ended December 31, (in millions): 2019 2018 2017 Net cash provided by (used for): Operating activities $ 3,752.6 $ 3,748.3 $ 2,925.6 Investing activities (3,987.5 ) (2,749.5 ) (2,800.9 ) Financing activities 521.7 (607.7 ) (113.0 ) Net effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash (13.7 ) (41.1 ) 6.7 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash $ 273.1 $ 350.0 $ 18.4 We use our cash flows to fund our operations and investments in our business, including tower maintenance and improvements, communications site construction and managed network installations and tower and land acquisitions. Additionally, we use our cash flows to make distributions, including distributions of our REIT taxable income to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT under the Code. We may also repay or repurchase our existing indebtedness or equity from time to time. We typically fund our international expansion efforts primarily through a combination of cash on hand, intercompany debt and equity contributions. In April 2019, Tata Teleservices and Tata Sons Limited, two of our minority holders in India, delivered notice of exercise of their put options with respect to their remaining combined holdings in our Indian subsidiary, ATC TIPL (see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report). Accordingly, we expect to pay an amount equivalent to INR 24.8 billion (approximately $347.6 million at the December 31, 2019 exchange rate) to redeem the put shares in the first half of 2020, subject to regulatory approval. In connection with the closing of the Eaton Towers Acquisition (see note 7 to our 38 Table of Contents consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report), we entered into an agreement with MTN to acquire MTN’s noncontrolling interests in each of our joint ventures in Ghana and Uganda for total consideration of approximately $523.0 million . The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2020, subject to regulatory approval and other closing conditions. As of December 31, 2019 , we had total outstanding indebtedness of $24.2 billion , with a current portion of $2.9 billion . During the year ended December 31, 2019 , we generated sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our capital expenditures and debt service obligations, as well as our required distributions. We believe the cash generated by operating activities during the year ending December 31, 2020 , together with our borrowing capacity under our credit facilities and cash on hand, will be sufficient to fund our required distributions, capital expenditures, debt service obligations (interest and principal repayments) and signed acquisitions. As of December 31, 2019 , we had $1.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries, of which $583.0 million was held by our joint ventures. While certain subsidiaries may pay us interest or principal on intercompany debt, it has not been our practice to repatriate earnings from our foreign subsidiaries primarily due to our ongoing expansion efforts and related capital needs. However, in the event that we do repatriate any funds, we may be required to accrue and pay certain taxes. Cash Flows from Operating Activities For the year ended December 31, 2019 , cash provided by operating activities increased $4.3 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The primary factors that impacted cash provided by operating activities as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, include: • An increase in non-cash operating activities, including an increase of approximately $95.9 million in straight-line revenue and a decrease of approximately $13.5 million in straight-line expense; • An increase in our operating profit of $78.4 million ; and • A decrease of approximately $39.5 million in cash paid for interest. For the year ended December 31, 2018 cash provided by operating activities increased $822.7 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The primary factors that impacted cash provided by operating activities as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, include: • An increase in our operating profit of $594.5 million; • An increase of approximately $77.6 million in cash paid for interest; • A decrease in cash required for working capital, primarily as a result of accounts receivable collection; and • An increase of approximately $27.4 million in cash paid for taxes.

We plan to continue to allocate our available capital, after satisfying our distribution requirements, among investment alternatives that meet our return on investment criteria, while maintaining our commitment to our long-term financial policies. Accordingly, we expect to continue to deploy capital through our annual capital expenditure program, including land purchases and new site construction, and through acquisitions. We also regularly review our tower portfolios as to capital expenditures required to upgrade our towers to our structural standards or address capacity, structural or permitting issues. We expect that our 2020 total capital expenditures will be as follows (in millions): Discretionary capital projects (1) $ 375 to $ 405 Ground lease purchases 175 to 185 Capital improvements and corporate expenditures 160 to 180 Redevelopment 260 to 280 Start-up capital projects 130 to 150 Total capital expenditures $ 1,100 to $ 1,200 _______________ (1) Includes the construction of approximately 6,000 to 7,000 communications sites globally.

During the year ended December 31, 2019 , we borrowed an aggregate of $3.2 billion and repaid an aggregate of $1.6 billion of revolving indebtedness. We used the borrowings to fund acquisitions, including the Eaton Towers Acquisition, to repay existing indebtedness and for general corporate purposes. We currently have $6.1 million of undrawn letters of credit and maintain the ability to draw down and repay amounts under the 2019 Credit Facility in the ordinary course. 2019 364-Day Term Loan —On February 14, 2019, we entered into the 2019 364-Day Term Loan, the net proceeds of which were used, together with cash on hand, to repay all amounts outstanding under the unsecured term loan entered into on March 29, 2018. The 2019 364-Day Term Loan matured on February 13, 2020 and had an interest rate that ranged between 0.550% and 1.375% above LIBOR for LIBOR based borrowings or up to 0.375% above the defined base rate for base rate borrowings, in each case based upon our debt ratings. On the February 13, 2020 maturity date, we repaid all amounts outstanding under the 2019 364-Day Term Loan with proceeds from the 2020 Term Loan (as defined below), borrowings from the 2019 Credit Facility and cash on hand. As of December 31, 2019 , the key terms under the 2019 Multicurrency Credit Facility, the 2019 Credit Facility, the 2019 Term Loan and the 2019 364-Day Term Loan were as follows: Bank Facility (1) Outstanding Principal Balance Maturity Date LIBOR borrowing interest rate range (2) Base rate borrowing interest rate range (2) Current margin over LIBOR and the base rate, respectively 2019 Multicurrency Credit Facility $ 700.0 June 28, 2023 (3) 0.875% - 1.750% 0.000% - 0.750% 1.125% and 0.125% 2019 Credit Facility $ 1,600.0 January 31, 2025 (3) 0.875% - 1.750% 0.000% - 0.750% 1.125% and 0.125% 2019 Term Loan $ 1,000.0 January 31, 2025 0.875% - 1.750% 0.000% - 0.750% 1.125% and 0.125% 2019 364-Day Term Loan $ 1,000.0 February 13, 2020 0.550% - 1.375% 0.000% - 0.375% 0.800% and 0.000% _______________ (1) Currently borrowed at LIBOR. (2) Represents interest rate above LIBOR for LIBOR based borrowings and the interest rate above the defined base rate for base rate borrowings, in each case based on our debt ratings. (3) Subject to two optional renewal periods. The 2019 Multicurrency Credit Facility and the 2019 Credit Facility are subject to two optional renewal periods and we must pay a quarterly commitment fee on the undrawn portion of each facility. The commitment fee for each of the 2019 Multicurrency Credit Facility and the 2019 Credit Facility ranges from 0.080% to 0.300% per annum, based upon our debt ratings, and is currently 0.110%. 2020 Term Loan —On February 13, 2020, we entered into a $750.0 million unsecured term loan (the “2020 Term Loan”), the net proceeds of which were used to repay outstanding indebtedness under the 2019 364-Day Term Loan. The 2020 Term Loan matures on February 12, 2021 and has an interest rate that is 0.65% above LIBOR for LIBOR based borrowings or 0.00% above the defined base rate for base rate borrowings. Any outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest will be due and payable in full at maturity. The 2019 Multicurrency Credit Facility, the 2019 Credit Facility, the 2019 Term Loan and the 2020 Term Loan do not require amortization of principal and may be paid prior to maturity in whole or in part at our option without penalty or premium. We have the option of choosing either a defined base rate or the LIBOR as the applicable base rate for borrowings under these bank facilities. The loan agreements for each of the 2019 Multicurrency Credit Facility, the 2019 Credit Facility, the 2019 Term Loan and the 2020 Term Loan contain certain reporting, information, financial and operating covenants and other restrictions (including limitations on additional debt, guaranties, sales of assets and liens) with which we must comply. Failure to comply with the financial and operating covenants of the loan agreements could not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under the revolving credit facilities, but may constitute a default, which could result in, among other things, the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable. India Indebtedness— During the year ended December 31, 2019, we repaid all remaining debt assumed in connection with the Viom Acquisition and debt entered into by ATC TIPL. The remaining India indebtedness includes several working capital facilities, most of which are subject to annual renewal. The working capital facilities bear interest at rates that consist of the applicable bank’s Marginal Cost of Funds based Lending Rate (as defined in the applicable agreement), plus a spread. 43 Table of Contents Generally, the working capital facilities are payable on demand prior to maturity. Amounts outstanding and key terms of the India indebtedness consisted of the following as of December 31, 2019 (in millions, except percentages): Amount Outstanding (INR) Amount Outstanding (USD) Interest Rate (Range) Maturity Date (Range) Working capital facilities (1) — $ — 8.15% - 8.75% March 18, 2020 - October 23, 2020 _______ (1) 5.6 billion INR ( $78.9 million ) of borrowing capacity as of December 31, 2019. Stock Repurchase Programs —We have two stock repurchase programs, the 2011 Buyback and the 2017 Buyback. During the year ended December 31, 2019 , we repurchased 93,654 shares of our common stock under the 2011 Buyback for an aggregate of $19.6 million , including commissions and fees. We had no repurchases under the 2017 Buyback. Under each program, we are authorized to purchase shares from time to time through open market purchases or in privately negotiated transactions not to exceed market prices and subject to market conditions and other factors. With respect to open market purchases, we may use plans adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act in accordance with securities laws and other legal requirements, which allows us to repurchase shares during periods when we otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of self-imposed trading blackout periods. These programs may be discontinued at any time. We expect to continue managing the pacing of the remaining $2.1 billion under the Buyback Programs in response to general market conditions and other relevant factors. We expect to fund further repurchases of our common stock through a combination of cash on hand, cash generated by operations and borrowings under our credit facilities. Purchases under the Buyback Programs are subject to us having available cash to fund repurchases. Sales of Equity Securities —We receive proceeds from sales of our equity securities pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan (the “ESPP”) and upon exercise of stock options granted under our equity incentive plan. For the year ended December 31, 2019 , we received an aggregate of $105.5 million in proceeds upon exercises of stock options and sales pursuant to the ESPP. Distributions— As a REIT, we must annually distribute to our stockholders an amount equal to at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain). Generally, we have distributed, and expect to continue to distribute, all or substantially all of our REIT taxable income after taking into consideration our utilization of NOLs. We have distributed an aggregate of approximately $7.4 billion to our common stockholders, including the dividend paid in January 2020, primarily classified as ordinary income that may be treated as qualified REIT dividends under Section 199A of the Code for taxable years ending after 2017 and before 2026. The amount, timing and frequency of future distributions will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on various factors, a number of which may be beyond our control, including our financial condition and operating cash flows, the amount required to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT and reduce any income and excise taxes that we otherwise would be required to pay, limitations on distributions in our existing and future debt and preferred equity instruments, our ability to utilize NOLs to offset our distribution requirements, limitations on our ability to fund distributions using cash generated through our TRSs and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. During the year ended December 31, 2019 , we paid $3.61 per share, or $1.6 billion , to common stockholders of record. In addition, we declared a distribution of $1.01 per share, or $447.3 million , paid on January 14, 2020 to our common stockholders of record at the close of business on December 27, 2019. We accrue distributions on unvested restricted stock units, which are payable upon vesting. The amount accrued for distributions payable related to unvested restricted stock units was $14.3 million and $13.7 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2019 , we paid $7.0 million of distributions upon the vesting of restricted stock units. For more details on the cash distributions paid to our common stockholders during the year ended December 31, 2019 , see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. 44 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations —The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019 (in millions): Contractual Obligations 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 Thereafter Total Long-term debt, including current portion: American Tower Corporation debt: 2019 Multicurrency Credit Facility $ — $ — $ — $ 700.0 $ — $ — $ 700.0 2019 Term Loan — — — — — 1,000.0 1,000.0 2019 Credit Facility — — — — — 1,600.0 1,600.0 2019 364-Day Term Loan (1) 1,000.0 — — — — — 1,000.0 2.800% senior notes 750.0 — — — — — 750.0 3.300% senior notes — 750.0 — — — — 750.0 3.450% senior notes — 650.0 — — — — 650.0 5.900% senior notes (2) 500.0 — — — — — 500.0 2.250% senior notes — — 600.0 — — — 600.0 4.70% senior notes — — 700.0 — — — 700.0 3.50% senior notes — — — 1,000.0 — — 1,000.0 3.000% senior notes — — — 700.0 — — 700.0 5.00% senior notes — — — — 1,000.0 — 1,000.0 3.375% senior notes — — — — 650.0 — 650.0 1.375% senior notes — — — — — 560.6 560.6 2.950% senior notes — — — — — 650.0 650.0 3.375% senior notes — — — — — 1,000.0 1,000.0 4.000% senior notes — — — — — 750.0 750.0 4.400% senior notes — — — — — 500.0 500.0 1.950% senior notes — — — — — 560.6 560.6 3.125% senior notes — — — — — 400.0 400.0 2.750% senior notes — — — — — 750.0 750.0 3.55% senior notes — — — — — 750.0 750.0 3.600% senior notes — — — — — 700.0 700.0 3.950% senior notes — — — — — 600.0 600.0 3.800% senior notes — — — — — 1,650.0 1,650.0 3.700% senior notes — — — — — 600.0 600.0 Total American Tower Corporation debt 2,250.0 1,400.0 1,300.0 2,400.0 1,650.0 12,071.2 21,071.2 American Tower subsidiary debt: Series 2013-2A securities (3) — — — 1,300.0 — — 1,300.0 Series 2018-1A securities (3) — — — — — 500.0 500.0 Series 2015-1 notes (4) 350.0 — — — — — 350.0 Series 2015-2 notes (5) — — — — — 525.0 525.0 Other subsidiary debt (6) 323.8 42.4 35.8 20.8 — — 422.8 Total American Tower subsidiary debt 673.8 42.4 35.8 1,320.8 — 1,025.0 3,097.8 Long-term obligations, excluding finance leases 2,923.8 1,442.4 1,335.8 3,720.8 1,650.0 13,096.2 24,169.0 Cash interest expense 807.0 752.4 663.3 563.3 475.4 1,343.1 4,604.5 Finance lease payments (including interest) 8.0 5.3 4.3 3.0 2.1 45.4 68.1 Total debt service obligations 3,738.8 2,200.1 2,003.4 4,287.1 2,127.5 14,484.7 28,841.6 Operating lease payments (7) 904.3 878.3 845.5 810.3 766.4 6,140.1 10,344.9 Other non-current liabilities (8)(9) 6.6 9.0 20.1 14.3 8.0 3,371.9 3,429.9 Total $ 4,649.7 $ 3,087.4 $ 2,869.0 $ 5,111.7 $ 2,901.9 $ 23,996.7 $ 42,616.4 _______________ (1) Repaid in full on February 13, 2020.

(4) Represents anticipated repayment date; final legal maturity is June 15, 2045. (5) Represents anticipated repayment date; final legal maturity is June 15, 2050. (6) Includes our South African credit facility, which is denominated in ZAR and amortizes through December 17, 2020, our Colombian credit facility, which is denominated in COP and amortizes through April 24, 2021, our Brazil credit facility, which is denominated in BRL and matures on January 15, 2022, 45 Table of Contents debt entered into by our Kenyan subsidiary in connection with an acquisition of sites in Kenya (the “Kenya Debt”), which is required to be paid either (i) in future installments subject to the satisfaction of specified conditions or (ii) three years from the note origination date, U.S. subsidiary debt related to a seller-financed acquisition (the “U.S. Subsidiary Debt”) and debt entered into by certain Eaton Towers subsidiaries acquired in connection with the Eaton Towers Acquisition (the “Eaton Towers Debt”), which is denominated in U.S. Dollar (“USD”), EUR, Kenyan Shilling (“KES”) and West African CFA Franc. Subsequent to December 31, 2019, we repaid all of the outstanding Eaton Towers USD denominated and KES denominated debt. (7) Includes payments under non-cancellable initial terms, as well as payments for certain renewal periods at our option, which we expect to renew because failure to do so could result in a loss of the applicable communications sites and related revenues from tenant leases. (8) Primarily represents our asset retirement obligations and excludes certain other non-current liabilities included in our consolidated balance sheet, primarily unearned revenue that is not payable in cash. (9) Excludes $126.3 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax positions and $26.6 million of accrued income tax related interest and penalties included in our consolidated balance sheet as we are uncertain as to when and if the amounts may be settled. Settlement of such amounts could require the use of cash flows generated from operations. We expect the unrecognized tax benefits to change over the next 12 months if certain tax matters ultimately settle with the applicable taxing jurisdiction during this timeframe. However, based on the status of these items and the amount of uncertainty associated with the outcome and timing of audit settlements, we are currently unable to estimate the impact of the amount of such changes, if any, to previously recorded uncertain tax positions. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements —We have no material off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K. Factors Affecting Sources of Liquidity Our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities, borrow funds under our credit facilities and maintain compliance with the contractual agreements governing our indebtedness. We believe that the debt agreements discussed below represent our material debt agreements that contain covenants, our compliance with which would be material to an investor’s understanding of our financial results and the impact of those results on our liquidity. Internally Generated Funds —Because the majority of our tenant leases are multiyear contracts, a significant majority of the revenues generated by our property operations as of the end of 2019 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. Accordingly, a key factor affecting our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is to maintain this recurring revenue and to convert it into operating profit by minimizing operating costs and fully achieving our operating efficiencies. In addition, our ability to increase cash flow from operating activities depends upon the demand for our communications sites and our related services and our ability to increase the utilization of our existing communications sites. Restrictions Under Loan Agreements Relating to Our Credit Facilities —The loan agreements for the 2019 Multicurrency Credit Facility, the 2019 Credit Facility, the 2019 Term Loan and the 2020 Term Loan contain certain financial and operating covenants and other restrictions applicable to us and our subsidiaries that are not designated as unrestricted subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. These restrictions include limitations on additional debt, distributions and dividends, guaranties, sales of assets and liens. The loan agreements also contain covenants that establish financial tests with which we and our restricted subsidiaries must comply related to total leverage and senior secured leverage, as set forth in the table below. As of December 31, 2019 , we were in compliance with each of these covenants. Compliance Tests For The 12 Months Ended December 31, 2019 ($ in billions) Ratio (1) Additional Debt Capacity Under Covenants (2) Capacity for Adjusted EBITDA Decrease Under Covenants (3) Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ≤ 6.00:1.00 ~$5.8 ~$1.0 Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio Senior Secured Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ≤ 3.00:1.00 ~$11.7 (4) ~$3.9 _______________ (1) Each component of the ratio as defined in the applicable loan agreement. (2) Assumes no change to Adjusted EBITDA. (3) Assumes no change to our debt levels. (4) Effectively, however, additional Senior Secured Debt under this ratio would be limited to the capacity under the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio. The loan agreements for our credit facilities also contain reporting and information covenants that require us to provide financial and operating information to the lenders within certain time periods. If we are unable to provide the required information on a timely basis, we would be in breach of these covenants. Failure to comply with the financial maintenance tests and certain other covenants of the loan agreements for our credit facilities could not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under these credit facilities, but may constitute a default under these credit facilities, which could result in, among other things, the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable. If this were to occur, we may not have sufficient cash on hand 46 Table of Contents to repay such indebtedness. The key factors affecting our ability to comply with the debt covenants described above are our financial performance relative to the financial maintenance tests defined in the loan agreements for these credit facilities and our ability to fund our debt service obligations. Based upon our current expectations, we believe our operating results during the next 12 months will be sufficient to comply with these covenants. Restrictions Under Agreements Relating to the 2015 Securitization and the Trust Securitizations— The indenture and related supplemental indentures governing the American Tower Secured Revenue Notes, Series 2015-1, Class A (the “Series 2015-1 Notes”) and the American Tower Secured Revenue Notes, Series 2015-2, Class A (the “Series 2015-2 Notes,” and, together with the Series 2015-1 Notes, the “2015 Notes”) issued by GTP Acquisition Partners I, LLC (“GTP Acquisition Partners”) in the 2015 Securitization and the loan agreement related to Trust Securitizations, as discussed further in note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report, include certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions customary for transactions subject to rated securitizations. Among other things, GTP Acquisition Partners and American Tower Asset Sub, LLC and American Tower Asset Sub II, LLC (together, the “AMT Asset Subs”) are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets, subject to customary carve-outs for ordinary course trade payables and permitted encumbrances (as defined in the applicable agreement). Under the agreements, amounts due will be paid from the cash flows generated by the assets securing the 2015 Notes or the assets securing the nonrecourse loan made by the American Tower Trust I (the “Trust”) to the AMT Asset Subs (the “Loan”), as applicable, which must be deposited into certain reserve accounts, and thereafter distributed solely pursuant to the terms of the applicable agreement. On a monthly basis, after payment of all required amounts under the applicable agreement, subject to the conditions described in the table below, the excess cash flows generated from the operation of such assets are released to GTP Acquisition Partners or the AMT Asset Subs, as applicable, which can then be distributed to, and used by, us. As of December 31, 2019 , $63.1 million held in such reserve accounts was classified as restricted cash. Certain information with respect to the 2015 Securitization and the Trust Securitizations is set forth below. The debt service coverage ratio (“DSCR”) is generally calculated as the ratio of the net cash flow (as defined in the applicable agreement) to the amount of interest, servicing fees and trustee fees required to be paid over the succeeding 12 months on the principal amount of the 2015 Notes or the Loan, as applicable, that will be outstanding on the payment date following such date of determination.

During a Cash Trap DSCR condition, all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments, fund required reserves, pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and make other payments required under the applicable transaction documents, referred to as excess cash flow, will be deposited into a reserve account (the “Cash Trap Reserve Account”) instead of being released to the applicable issuer or borrower. (3) An amortization period commences if the DSCR is equal to or below 1.15x (the “Minimum DSCR”) at the end of any calendar quarter and continues to exist until the DSCR exceeds the Minimum DSCR for two consecutive calendar quarters. (4) No amortization period is triggered if the outstanding principal amount of a series has not been repaid in full on the applicable anticipated repayment date. However, in such event, additional interest will accrue on the unpaid principal balance of the applicable series, and such series will begin to amortize on a monthly basis from excess cash flow. (5) An amortization period exists if the outstanding principal amount has not been paid in full on the applicable anticipated repayment date and continues to exist until such principal has been repaid in full. A failure to meet the noted DSCR tests could prevent GTP Acquisition Partners or the AMT Asset Subs from distributing excess cash flow to us, which could affect our ability to fund our capital expenditures, including tower construction and acquisitions and meet REIT distribution requirements. During an “amortization period,” all excess cash flow and any amounts in the applicable Cash Trap Reserve Account would be applied to pay principal of the 2015 Notes or the Loan, as applicable, on each monthly payment date, and so would not be available for distribution to us. Further, additional interest will begin to accrue with respect to any series of the 2015 Notes or subclass of the Loan from and after the anticipated repayment date at a per annum rate determined in accordance with the applicable agreement. With respect to the 2015 Notes, upon the occurrence and during an event of default, the applicable trustee may, in its discretion or at the direction of holders of more than 50% of the aggregate outstanding principal of any series of the 2015 Notes, declare such series of 2015 Notes immediately due and payable, in which case any excess cash flow would need to be used to pay holders of such notes. Furthermore, if GTP Acquisition Partners or the AMT Asset Subs were to default on a series of the 2015 Notes or the Loan, the applicable trustee may seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of all or any portion of the 3,542 communications sites that secure the 2015 Notes or the 5,114 broadcast and wireless communications towers and related assets that secure the Loan, respectively, in which case we could lose such sites and the revenue associated with those assets. As discussed above, we use our available liquidity and seek new sources of liquidity to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, satisfy our distribution requirements and repay or repurchase our debt. If we determine that it is desirable or necessary to raise additional capital, we may be unable to do so, or such additional financing may be prohibitively expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness. If we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise, we may not be able to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, satisfy our REIT distribution requirements and debt service obligations or refinance our existing indebtedness. In addition, our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities. As set forth under Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption “Risk Factors,” we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a small number of tenants and, consequently, a failure by a significant tenant to perform its contractual obligations to us could adversely affect our cash flow and liquidity. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We have reviewed our policies and estimates to determine our critical accounting policies for the year ended December 31, 2019 . We have identified the following policies as critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition. This is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies. See note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for a summary of our significant accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP, with no need for management’s judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result. • Impairment of Assets—Assets Subject to Depreciation and Amortization : We review long-lived assets for impairment at least annually or whenever events, changes in circumstances or other indicators or evidence indicate that the carrying amount of our assets may not be recoverable. 48 Table of Contents We review our tower portfolio and network location intangible assets for indicators of impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, typically at an individual tower basis. Possible indicators include a tower not having current tenant leases or having expenses in excess of revenues. A cash flow modeling approach is utilized to assess recoverability and incorporates, among other items, the tower location, the tower location demographics, the timing of additions of new tenants, lease rates and estimated length of tenancy and ongoing cash requirements. We review our tenant-related intangible assets on a tenant by tenant basis for indicators of impairment, such as high levels of turnover or attrition, non-renewal of a significant number of contracts or the cancellation or termination of a relationship. We assess recoverability by determining whether the carrying amount of the tenant-related intangible assets will be recovered primarily through projected undiscounted future cash flows. If the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of our long-lived assets is less than the carrying amount of the assets, an impairment loss may be recognized. Key assumptions included in the undiscounted cash flows are future revenue projections, estimates of ongoing tenancies and operating margins. An impairment loss would be based on the fair value of the asset, which is based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows to be provided from the asset. We record any related impairment charge in the period in which we identify such impairment. In October 2019, the Indian Supreme Court issued a ruling regarding the definition of AGR and associated fees and charges that may have a material financial impact on certain of our tenants which could affect their ability to perform their obligations under agreements with us. We will continue to monitor the status of these developments, as it is possible that the estimated future cash flows may differ from current estimates and changes in estimated cash flows from tenants in India could have an impact on previously recorded tangible and intangible assets, including amounts originally recorded as tenant-related intangibles. The carrying value of tenant-related intangibles in India was $1,124.4 million as of December 31, 2019 , which represents 12% of our consolidated balance of $8,999.5 million . Additionally, a significant reduction in tenant related cash flows in India could also impact our tower portfolio and network location intangibles. The carrying values of our tower portfolio and network location intangibles in India were $1,064.8 million and $483.4 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2019, which represent 13% and 15% of our consolidated balances of $7,964.1 million and $3,230.4 million , respectively. • Impairment of Assets—Goodwill: We review goodwill for impairment at least annually (as of December 31) or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill is recorded in the applicable segment and assessed for impairment at the reporting unit level. We utilize the two step impairment test and employ a discounted cash flow analysis when testing goodwill for impairment. The key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance, terminal sales growth rate, management’s expectations of future operating results and cash requirements, the current weighted average cost of capital and an expected tax rate. Under the first step of this test, we compare the fair value of the reporting unit, as calculated under an income approach using future discounted cash flows, to the carrying amount of the applicable reporting unit. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, we conduct the second step of this test, in which the implied fair value of the applicable reporting unit’s goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount of the excess. During the year ended December 31, 2019 , no potential impairment was identified as the fair value of each of our reporting units was in excess of its carrying amount. The fair value of our India reporting unit, which is based on the present value of forecasted future value cash flows (the income approach) exceeded the carrying value by approximately 7%. Key assumptions include future revenue growth rates and operating margins, capital expenditures, terminal period growth rate and the weighted-average cost of capital, which were determined considering historical data and current assumptions related to the impacts of the carrier consolidation, each of which could be impacted by our tenants’ ability to perform their contractual obligations as a result of the AGR ruling or otherwise. For this reporting unit, we performed a sensitivity analysis on our significant assumptions and determined that a (i) less than 1% reduction of projected revenues, (ii) 42 basis point increase in the weighted-average cost of capital or (iii) 17% reduction in terminal sales growth rate, individually, each of which we determined to be reasonable, would impact our conclusion that the fair value of the India reporting unit exceeds its carrying value. Events that could negatively affect our India reporting unit’s financial results include increased tenant attrition exceeding our forecast resulting from the ongoing carrier consolidation, carrier tenant bankruptcies and other factors set forth in Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption “Risk Factors.” The carrying value of goodwill in the India reporting unit was $1,021.8 million as of December 31, 2019 , which represents 17% of our consolidated balance of $6,178.3 million . • Asset Retirement Obligations: When required, we recognize the fair value of obligations to remove our tower assets and remediate the leased land upon which certain of our tower assets are located. Generally, the associated retirement 49 Table of Contents costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related tower assets and depreciated over their estimated useful lives and the liability is accreted through the obligation’s estimated settlement date. We updated our assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation, which resulted in a net decrease in the estimated obligation of $66.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 . The change in 2019 primarily resulted from changes in timing of certain settlement date and cost assumptions. Fair value estimates of liabilities for asset retirement obligations generally involve discounting of estimated future cash flows. Periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is included in Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense in the consolidated statements of operations. The significant assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation are: timing of tower removals; cost of tower removals; timing and number of land lease renewals; expected inflation rates; and credit-adjusted risk-free interest rates that approximate our incremental borrowing rate. While we feel the assumptions are appropriate, there can be no assurances that actual costs and the probability of incurring obligations will not differ from these estimates. We will continue to review these assumptions periodically and we may need to adjust them as necessary. • Acquisitions : We evaluate each of our acquisitions under the accounting guidance framework to determine whether to treat an acquisition as an asset acquisition or a business combination. For those transactions treated as asset acquisitions, the purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired, with no recognition of goodwill. For those acquisitions that meet the definition of a business combination, we apply the acquisition method of accounting where assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value at the date of each acquisition, and the results of operations are included with our results from the dates of the respective acquisitions. Any excess of the purchase price paid over the amounts recognized for assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. We continue to evaluate acquisitions accounted for as business combinations for a period not to exceed one year after the applicable acquisition date of each transaction to determine whether any additional adjustments are needed to the allocation of the purchase price paid for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is typically determined by using either estimates of replacement costs or discounted cash flow valuation methods. When determining the fair value of tangible assets acquired, we must estimate the cost to replace the asset with a new asset taking into consideration such factors as age, condition and the economic useful life of the asset. When determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired, we must estimate the applicable discount rate and the timing and amount of future tenant cash flows, including rate and terms of renewal and attrition. • Revenue Recognition: Our revenue is derived from leasing the right to use our communications sites and the land on which the sites are located (the “lease component”) and from the reimbursement of costs incurred in operating the communications sites and supporting the tenants’ equipment as well as other services and contractual rights (the “non-lease component”). Most of our revenue is derived from leasing arrangements and is accounted for as lease revenue unless the timing and pattern of revenue recognition of the non-lease component differs from the lease component. If the timing and pattern of the non-lease component revenue recognition differs from that of the lease component, we separately determine the stand-alone selling prices and pattern of revenue recognition for each performance obligation. Our revenue from leasing arrangements, including fixed escalation clauses present in non-cancellable lease arrangements, is reported on a straight-line basis over the term of the respective leases when collectibility is probable. Escalation clauses tied to a consumer price index or other inflation-based indices, and other incentives present in lease agreements with our tenants, are excluded from the straight-line calculation. Total property straight-line revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 were $183.5 million , $87.6 million and $194.4 million , respectively. Amounts billed upfront in connection with the execution of lease agreements are initially deferred and reflected in Unearned revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and recognized as revenue over the terms of the applicable lease arrangements. Amounts billed or received for services prior to being earned are deferred and reflected in Unearned revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets until the criteria for recognition have been met. We derive the largest portion of our revenues, corresponding trade receivables and the related deferred rent asset from a small number of tenants in the telecommunications industry, with 54% of our revenues derived from four tenants. In addition, we have concentrations of credit risk in certain geographic areas. We mitigate the concentrations of credit risk with respect to notes and trade receivables by actively monitoring the creditworthiness of our borrowers and tenants. In recognizing tenant revenue we assess the collectibility of both the amounts billed and the portion recognized on a straight-line basis. This assessment takes tenant credit risk and business and industry conditions into consideration to ultimately determine the collectibility of the amounts billed. To the extent the amounts, based on management’s estimates, may not be collectible, recognition is deferred until such point as the uncertainty is resolved. Any amounts that were previously recognized as revenue and subsequently determined to be uncollectible are charged to bad debt expense. Accounts receivable are reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts related to estimated 50 Table of Contents losses resulting from a tenant’s inability to make required payments and allowances for amounts invoiced whose collectibility is not reasonably assured. • Rent Expense and Lease Accounting: Many of the leases underlying our tower sites have fixed rent escalations, which provide for periodic increases in the amount of ground rent payable over time. In addition, certain of our tenant leases require us to exercise available renewal options pursuant to the underlying ground lease if the tenant exercises its renewal option. We calculate straight-line ground rent expense for these leases based on the fixed non-cancellable term of the underlying ground lease plus all periods, if any, for which failure to renew the lease imposes an economic penalty to us such that renewal appears to be reasonably assured. Effective January 1, 2019, we adopted the new lease standard using the modified retrospective method applied to lease arrangements that were in place on the transition date. The new lease accounting guidance required us to recognize a right-of-use lease asset and lease liability for operating and finance leases. The right-of-use asset is measured as the sum of the lease liability, prepaid or accrued lease payments, any initial direct costs incurred and any other applicable amounts. The calculation of the lease liability requires us to make certain assumptions for each lease, including lease term and discount rate implicit in each lease, which could significantly impact the gross lease obligation, the duration and the present value of the lease liability. When calculating the lease term, we consider the renewal, cancellation and termination rights available to us and the lessor. We determine the discount rate by calculating the incremental borrowing rate on a collateralized basis at the commencement of a lease or upon a change in the lease term. • Income Taxes: Accounting for income taxes requires us to estimate the timing and impact of amounts recorded in our financial statements that may be recognized differently for tax purposes. To the extent that the timing of amounts recognized for financial reporting purposes differs from the timing of recognition for tax reporting purposes, deferred tax assets or liabilities are required to be recorded. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on the rate at which we expect these items to be reflected in our tax returns, which may differ from the current rate. We do not expect to pay federal income taxes on our REIT taxable income. We periodically review our deferred tax assets, and we record a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets. Valuation allowances would be reversed as a reduction to the provision for income taxes, if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based on changes in facts and circumstances relevant to the assets’ recoverability. We recognize the benefit of uncertain tax positions when, in management’s judgment, it is more likely than not that positions we have taken in our tax returns will be sustained upon examination, which are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. We adjust our tax liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information or information not previously available. Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which additional information is available or the position is ultimately settled under audit.

(g) Represents the weighted average variable rate of interest based on contractual notional amount as a percentage of total notional amounts. Interest Rate Risk As of December 31, 2019 , we have one interest rate swap agreement related to debt in Colombia. This swap has been designated as a cash flow hedge, has a notional amount of $18.3 million , has an interest rate of 5.37% and expires in April 2021. We also have three interest rate swap agreements related to the 2.250% Notes. These swaps have been designated as fair value hedges, have an aggregate notional amount of $600.0 million , an interest rate of one-month LIBOR plus applicable spreads and expire in January 2022. In addition, we have three interest rate swap agreements related to a portion of the 3.000% Notes. These swaps have been designated as fair value hedges, have an aggregate notional amount of $500.0 million , an interest rate of one-month LIBOR plus applicable spreads and expire in June 2023. Changes in interest rates can cause interest charges to fluctuate on our variable rate debt. Variable rate debt as of December 31, 2019 consisted of $700.0 million under the 2019 Multicurrency Credit Facility, $1.6 billion under the 2019 Credit Facility, $1.0 billion under the 2019 Term Loan, $1.0 billion under the 2019 364-Day Term Loan, $600.0 million under the interest rate swap agreements related to the 2.250% Notes, $500.0 million under the interest rate swap agreements related to the 3.000% Notes, $20.8 million under the South African credit facility, $6.1 million under the Colombian credit facility after giving effect to our interest rate swap agreements, $16.3 million under the Brazil credit facility and $329.8 million under the Eaton Towers Debt. A 10% increase in current interest rates would result in an additional $20.8 million of interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 . 52 Table of Contents Foreign Currency Risk We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily in connection with our foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures internationally. Any transaction denominated in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar is reported in U.S. Dollars at the applicable exchange rate. All assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. Dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of the applicable fiscal reporting period and all revenues and expenses are translated at average rates for the period. The cumulative translation effect is included in equity as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We may enter into additional foreign currency financial instruments in anticipation of future transactions to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. For the year ended December 31, 2019 , 43% of our revenues and 51% of our total operating expenses were denominated in foreign currencies. As of December 31, 2019 , we have incurred intercompany debt that is not considered to be permanently reinvested, and similar unaffiliated balances that were denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the subsidiary in which it is recorded. As this debt had not been designated as being a long-term investment in nature, any changes in the foreign currency exchange rates will result in unrealized gains or losses, which will be included in our determination of net income. An adverse change of 10% in the underlying exchange rates of our unsettled intercompany debt and similar unaffiliated balances would result in $105.4 million of unrealized losses that would be included in Other expense in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 . ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA See Item 15 (a). ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures We have established disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that material information relating to us, including our consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to the officers who certify our financial reports and to other members of senior management and the Board of Directors. Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2019 and designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the requisite time periods specified in the applicable rules and forms, and that it is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 . As discussed in Item 1 of this Annual Report under the caption “Business” and in note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report, we completed our acquisition of Eaton Towers on December 31, 2019. As permitted by the rules and regulations of the SEC, we excluded from our assessment the internal control over financial reporting at Eaton Towers, whose financial statements reflect total assets and revenues constituting 6% and 0%, respectively, of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of, and for the year ended, December 31, 2019. 53 Table of Contents In making its assessment of internal control over financial reporting, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) . Based on this assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2019 , our internal control over financial reporting is effective. Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm that audited our financial statements included in this Annual Report, has issued an attestation report on management’s internal control over financial reporting, which is included in this Item 9A under the caption “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm.” Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2019 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. As set forth above, we excluded from our assessment the internal control over financial reporting at Eaton Towers for the year ended December 31, 2019. We consider Eaton Towers material to our results of operations, financial position and cash flows, and we are in the process of integrating the internal control procedures of Eaton Towers into our internal control structure. 54 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of American Tower Corporation Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of American Tower Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019, of the Company and our report dated February 25, 2020, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and included an explanatory paragraph related to the Company’s adoption of FASB Accounting Standards Update 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) , on January 1, 2019. As described in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at Eaton Towers Holdings Limited (“Eaton Towers”), which was acquired on December 31, 2019, and whose financial statements constitute 6% of total assets and 0% of net revenues of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at Eaton Towers. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP Boston, Massachusetts February 25, 2020 55 Table of Contents PART III ITEM 10.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 25, 2020, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Change in Accounting Principle As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, effective January 1, 2019, the Company adopted the FASB’s new standard related to leases, Accounting Standard Update 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), using the modified retrospective approach. The adoption of the new lease standard is also communicated as a critical audit matter below. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Leases - Refer to Notes 1 and 4 to the financial statements (also see change in accounting principle paragraph above) Critical Audit Matter Description The Company adopted the new lease standard on January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective approach. The Company recognized and measured their operating leases within the scope of the standard through a cumulative-effect adjustment by recording an operating lease liability and a corresponding operating right-of-use asset on January 1, 2019. The initial operating lease liability recorded was determined based on the present value of the remaining lease payments for all the Company’s operating leases that are within the scope of the standard. F-2 Table of Contents Management made significant estimates and assumptions in adopting the standard and was required to apply these estimates and assumptions to a high volume of leases globally. We identified the initial adoption of the standard as a critical audit matter given the complexity of applying the standard to numerous and differing lease provisions within the Company’s global lease portfolio. The related audit effort required a higher degree of auditor judgment and increased extent of effort when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s judgments, including the selection of the incremental borrowing rate and the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data utilized within the new leasing module of the Company’s general ledger. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our principal audit procedures related to the adoption of the standard included the following: • We tested the effectiveness of the Company’s controls over the adoption of the standard, including controls over a) the selection of the most critical assumptions, including the incremental borrowing rate, b) the process in place to validate the accuracy and completeness of the existing lease population, and c) the development and oversight of the Company’s new leasing module. • We evaluated the reasonableness of the Company’s incremental borrowing rates by testing the source information underlying the determination of the incremental borrowing rates and testing the mathematical accuracy of the calculations. • We judgmentally selected a sample of communication site locations from the Company’s fixed asset sub-ledger and tested for proper inclusion or exclusion from the corresponding operating lease liability and right-of-use asset account balance. • We judgmentally selected a sample of leases from the Company’s new global leasing module taking into consideration location, size and complexities of agreements and performed the following procedures for each selection: ◦ Tested management’s identification of the significant terms and provisions of the lease agreements for completeness and accuracy. ◦ Assessed the terms in the lease agreement and evaluated the appropriateness of management’s application of their accounting policies, along with their use of judgments and estimates, in the determination of the operating lease liability and right-of-use asset recorded. ◦ Developed an independent estimate of the operating lease liability and right-of-use asset and compared it to the amounts recorded. Revenue - Refer to Notes 1 and 4 to the financial statements Critical Audit Matter Description The Company’s contracts with major customers are often governed by a master lease agreement that contains terms and provisions governing the customer’s right to use the Company’s telecommunications sites and the land on which the sites are located (the “lease component”) and the customer’s responsibility for reimbursement of various costs incurred by the Company in operating the telecommunications towers and supporting the customer’s equipment as well as other services and contractual rights (the “non-lease components”). The master lease agreements contain both lease and non-lease components, may contain unusual or non-standard terms, and often pertain to a large number of the Company’s telecommunications sites. In the current year a revised master lease agreement was entered into with an existing major customer. Management of the Company exercised significant judgment in determining the appropriate revenue recognition for the revised master lease agreement, including the following: • Determination of the lease and non-lease components and whether they should be accounted for as a combined lease component or separately. • Determination of the stand-alone selling prices for each performance obligation in the master lease agreement if not accounted for with the lease component. • Determination of the fixed and variable consideration in the master lease agreement, the impact of cancellation and renewal provisions, the estimated term of each of the individual contracts impacted by the master lease agreement, and the pattern of recognition for each lease component or performance obligation. We identified the revised master lease agreement with a major customer as a critical audit matter because the audit effort required to evaluate management’s judgments in determining the appropriate revenue recognition for the impact of a multi-faceted, complex master lease agreement entered into with a major tenant was extensive. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit F-3 Table of Contents Our principal audit procedures related to the Company’s master lease agreement with a major customer included the following: • We tested the effectiveness of internal controls related to the Company’s process for evaluating the proper accounting for the master lease agreement. • We evaluated the Company’s significant accounting policies related to the master lease agreement for reasonableness and compliance with the applicable accounting standards. • We judgmentally selected a sample of individual communication site locations governed by the master lease agreement and performed the following procedures for each selection: ◦ Obtained and evaluated the relevant site location source documents and other documents that were part of the overall master lease agreement. ◦ Tested management’s identification of the significant terms for completeness and accuracy, including the identification of the lease and non-lease components, cancellation and renewal provisions, estimated term and fixed and variable consideration. ◦ Assessed the terms and provisions in the master lease agreement and the site location source documents and evaluated the appropriateness of management’s application of their accounting policies, along with their use of estimates, in the determination of revenue recognition conclusions. • We tested the mathematical accuracy of management’s determination of revenue and the associated timing of revenue recognized in the financial statements. /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP Boston, Massachusetts February 25, 2020 We have served as the Company's auditor since 1997.

F-9 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) 1. BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Business —American Tower Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, “ATC” or the “Company”) is one of the largest global real estate investment trusts and a leading independent owner, operator and developer of multitenant communications real estate. The Company’s primary business is the leasing of space on communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, wireless data providers, government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries. The Company refers to this business as its property operations. Additionally, the Company offers tower-related services in the United States, which the Company refers to as its services operations. These services include site acquisition, zoning and permitting (“AZP”) and structural analysis, which primarily support the Company’s site leasing business, including the addition of new tenants and equipment on its sites. The Company’s portfolio primarily consists of towers that it owns and towers that it operates pursuant to long-term lease arrangements, as well as distributed antenna system (“DAS”) networks, which provide seamless coverage solutions in certain in-building and certain outdoor wireless environments. In addition to the communications sites in its portfolio, the Company manages rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements. The Company also holds other telecommunications infrastructure, fiber and property interests that it leases primarily to communications service providers and third-party tower operators. American Tower Corporation is a holding company that conducts its operations through its directly and indirectly owned subsidiaries and joint ventures. ATC’s principal domestic operating subsidiaries are American Towers LLC and SpectraSite Communications, LLC. ATC conducts its international operations primarily through its subsidiary, American Tower International, Inc., which in turn conducts operations through its various international holding and operating subsidiaries and joint ventures. The Company operates as a real estate investment trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes (“REIT”). Accordingly, the Company generally is not required to pay U.S. federal income taxes on income generated by its REIT operations, including the income derived from leasing space on its towers, as it receives a dividends paid deduction for distributions to stockholders that generally offsets its REIT income and gains. However, the Company remains obligated to pay U.S. federal income taxes on earnings from its domestic taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRSs”). In addition, the Company’s international assets and operations, regardless of their classification for U.S. tax purposes, continue to be subject to taxation in the jurisdictions where those assets are held or those operations are conducted. The use of TRSs enables the Company to continue to engage in certain businesses while complying with REIT qualification requirements. The Company may, from time to time, change the election of previously designated TRSs to be included as part of the REIT. As of December 31, 2019 , the Company’s REIT-qualified businesses included its U.S. tower leasing business and a majority of its U.S. indoor DAS networks business and services segment, as well as most of its operations in Mexico, Germany, Costa Rica, Nigeria and France. Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation —The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and those entities in which it has a controlling interest. Investments in entities that the Company does not control are accounted for using the equity method or as investments in equity securities, depending upon the Company’s ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. As of December 31, 2019 , the Company holds (i) a 51 % controlling interest in each of two joint ventures, one in Ghana and one in Uganda (MTN Group Limited (“MTN”) holds a 49 % noncontrolling interest), (ii) a 51 % controlling interest in ATC Europe B.V. (“ATC Europe”), a joint venture that primarily consists of the Company’s operations in Germany and France, (PGGM holds a 49 % noncontrolling interest) and (iii) a 79 % controlling interest in ATC Telecom Infrastructure Private Limited (“ATC TIPL”), formerly Viom Networks Limited (“Viom”), in India (the remaining shareholders, as discussed in note 15, hold a 21 % noncontrolling interest). During the year ended December 31, 2019 , the Company purchased the remaining 19 % of noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary of the Company in South Africa from its local partner for $ 68.5 million , which resulted in an increase in the Company’s controlling interest from approximately 81 % to 100 % . The purchase is reflected in the consolidated statements of equity as a reduction of Additional Paid-in Capital of $ 49.5 million , an increase in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss of $ 3.1 million and a reduction in Noncontrolling Interests of $ 15.9 million . During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company entered into an agreement with MTN to acquire MTN’s noncontrolling interests in each of the Company’s joint ventures in Ghana and Uganda for total consideration of approximately F-10 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) $ 523.0 million . The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2020, subject to regulatory approval and other closing conditions. Change in Reportable Segments — During the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company’s Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) property segment was divided into the Africa property segment and the Europe property segment. As a result, the Company has six reportable segments: U.S. property, Asia property, Africa property, Europe property, Latin America property and services, which are discussed further in note 21. The change in reportable segments had no impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements for any periods. Historical financial information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K has been adjusted to reflect the change in reportable segments. Significant Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates —The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results may differ from those estimates, and such differences could be material to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The significant estimates in the accompanying consolidated financial statements include impairment of long-lived assets (including goodwill), asset retirement obligations, revenue recognition, rent expense and lease accounting, income taxes and accounting for business combinations and acquisitions of assets. The Company considers events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued as additional evidence for certain estimates or to identify matters that require additional disclosure. Accounts Receivable and Deferred Rent Asset —The Company derives the largest portion of its revenues and corresponding accounts receivable and the related deferred rent asset from a relatively small number of tenants in the telecommunications industry, and 54 % of its current-year revenues are derived from four tenants. The Company’s deferred rent asset is associated with non-cancellable tenant leases that contain fixed escalation clauses over the terms of the applicable lease in which revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company mitigates its concentrations of credit risk with respect to notes and trade receivables and the related deferred rent assets by actively monitoring the creditworthiness of its borrowers and tenants. In recognizing tenant revenue, the Company assesses the collectibility of both the amounts billed and the portion recognized in advance of billing on a straight-line basis. This assessment takes tenant credit risk and business and industry conditions into consideration to ultimately determine the collectibility of the amounts billed. To the extent the amounts, based on management’s estimates, may not be collectible, revenue recognition is deferred until such point as collectibility is determined to be reasonably assured. Any amounts that were previously recognized as revenue and subsequently determined to be uncollectible are charged to bad debt expense included in Selling, general, administrative and development expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Accounts receivable is reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts related to estimated losses resulting from a tenant’s inability to make required payments and allowances for amounts invoiced whose collectibility is not reasonably assured. These allowances are generally estimated based on payment patterns, days past due and collection history, and incorporate changes in economic conditions that may not be reflected in historical trends, such as tenants in bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization. Receivables are written-off against the allowances when they are determined to be uncollectible. Such determination includes analysis and consideration of the particular conditions of the account. Changes in the allowances were as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 Balance as of January 1, $ 282.4 $ 131.0 $ 45.9 Current year increases 104.3 157.8 87.2 Write-offs, recoveries and other (1) ( 223.4 ) ( 6.4 ) ( 2.1 ) Balance as of December 31, $ 163.3 $ 282.4 $ 131.0 _______________ (1) In 2019, write-offs are primarily related to uncollectible amounts in India. In 2018 and 2017, recoveries include recognition of revenue resulting from collections of previously reserved amounts. Functional Currency —The functional currency of each of the Company’s foreign operating subsidiaries is normally the respective local currency, except for Costa Rica and Argentina, where the functional currency is the U.S. Dollar. All foreign currency assets and liabilities held by the subsidiaries are translated into U.S. Dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the end of the applicable fiscal reporting period and all foreign currency revenues and expenses are translated at the average monthly exchange rates. Translation adjustments are reflected in equity as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss F-11 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) (“AOCL”) in the consolidated balance sheets and included as a component of Comprehensive income in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Gains and losses on foreign currency transactions are reflected in Other expense in the consolidated statements of operations. However, the effect from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on intercompany debt for which repayment is not anticipated in the foreseeable future is reflected in AOCL in the consolidated balance sheets and included as a component of Comprehensive income. The Company recorded the following net foreign currency losses: Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 Foreign currency losses recorded in AOCL $ 45.8 $ 385.8 $ 51.6 Foreign currency (gains) losses recorded in Other expense ( 6.1 ) 4.5 ( 26.4 ) Total foreign currency losses $ 39.7 $ 390.3 $ 25.2 Cash and Cash Equivalents —Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, demand deposits and short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less. The Company maintains its deposits at high-quality financial institutions and monitors the credit ratings of those institutions. Restricted Cash— Restricted cash includes cash pledged as collateral to secure obligations and all cash whose use is otherwise limited by contractual provisions. The reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash reported within the applicable balance sheet that sum to the total of the same such amounts shown in the statements of cash flows is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,501.2 $ 1,208.7 $ 802.1 Restricted cash 76.8 96.2 152.8 Total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 1,578.0 $ 1,304.9 $ 954.9 Property and Equipment —Property and equipment is recorded at cost or, in the case of acquired properties, at estimated fair value on the date acquired. Cost for self-constructed towers includes direct materials and labor, capitalized interest and certain indirect costs associated with construction of the tower, such as transportation costs, employee benefits and payroll taxes. The Company begins the capitalization of costs during the pre-construction period, which is the period during which costs are incurred to evaluate the site, and continues to capitalize costs until the tower is substantially completed and ready for occupancy by a tenant. Labor and related costs capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 were $ 48.3 million , $ 55.0 million and $ 50.9 million , respectively. Capitalized interest costs were not material for the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 . Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Augmentation and improvements that extend an asset’s useful life or enhance capacity are capitalized. Depreciation expense is recorded using the straight-line method over the assets’ estimated useful lives. Towers and related assets on leased land are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the term of the corresponding ground lease, taking into consideration lease renewal options and residual value. Towers or assets acquired through finance leases are recorded net at the present value of future minimum lease payments or the fair value of the leased asset at the inception of the lease. Property and equipment and assets held under finance leases are amortized over the shorter of the applicable lease term or the estimated useful life of the respective assets for periods generally not exceeding twenty years . The Company reviews its tower portfolio for indicators of impairment on an individual tower basis. Impairments primarily result from a tower not having current tenant leases or from having expenses in excess of revenues. The Company reviews other long-lived assets for impairment whenever events, changes in circumstances or other evidence indicate that the carrying amount F-12 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) of the Company’s assets may not be recoverable. The Company records impairment charges in Other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the Company identifies such impairment. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets —The Company reviews goodwill for impairment at least annually (as of December 31) or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill is recorded in the applicable segment and assessed for impairment at the reporting unit level. The Company utilizes the two-step impairment test and employs a discounted cash flow analysis when testing goodwill for impairment. The key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance, terminal sales growth rate, management’s expectations of future operating results and cash requirements, the current weighted average cost of capital and an expected tax rate. Under the first step of the test, the Company compares the fair value of the reporting unit, as calculated under an income approach using future discounted cash flows, to the carrying amount of the applicable reporting unit. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, the Company conducts the second step of this test, in which the implied fair value of the applicable reporting unit’s goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount of the excess. During the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , no potential impairment was identified under the first step of the test, as the fair value of each of the reporting units was in excess of its carrying amount. Intangible assets that are separable from goodwill and are deemed to have a definite life are amortized over their useful lives, generally ranging from three to twenty years and are evaluated separately for impairment at least annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The Company reviews its network location intangible assets for indicators of impairment on an individual tower basis. Impairments primarily result from a tower not having current tenant leases or from having expenses in excess of revenues. The Company monitors its tenant-related intangible assets on a tenant by tenant basis for indicators of impairment, such as high levels of turnover or attrition, non-renewal of a significant number of contracts or the cancellation or termination of a relationship. The Company assesses recoverability by determining whether the carrying amount of the related assets will be recovered primarily through projected undiscounted future cash flows. If the Company determines that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, the Company measures any impairment loss based on the projected future discounted cash flows to be provided from the asset or available market information relative to the asset’s fair value, as compared to the asset’s carrying amount. The Company records impairment charges, which are discussed in note 17, in Other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the Company identifies such impairment. Derivative Financial Instruments —Derivatives are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value. If a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in AOCL, as well as a component of comprehensive income, and are recognized in the results of operations when the hedged item affects earnings. Changes in fair value of the ineffective portions of cash flow hedges are recognized in the results of operations. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, changes in value of the derivatives are recorded in Other expense in the consolidated statements of operations in the current period, along with the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. For derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognized in the results of operations in the period that the change occurs. The primary risks managed through the use of derivative instruments is interest rate risk, exposure to changes in the fair value of debt attributable to interest rate risk and currency risk. From time to time, the Company enters into interest rate swap agreements or foreign currency contracts to manage exposure to these risks. Under these agreements, the Company is exposed to counterparty credit risk to the extent that a counterparty fails to meet the terms of a contract. The Company’s exposure is limited to the current value of the contract at the time the counterparty fails to perform. The Company assesses, both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows or fair values of hedged items. The Company does not hold derivatives for trading purposes. Fair Value Measurements —The Company determines the fair value of its financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Asset Retirement Obligations —When required, the Company recognizes the fair value of obligations to remove its tower assets and remediate the leased land upon which certain of its tower assets are located. Generally, the associated retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related tower assets and depreciated over their estimated useful lives and the F-13 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) liability is accreted through the obligation’s estimated settlement date. Fair value estimates of asset retirement obligations generally involve discounting of estimated future cash flows associated with takedown costs. Periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is included in Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Adjustments are also made to the asset retirement obligation liability to reflect changes in the estimates of timing and amount of expected cash flows, with an offsetting adjustment made to the related long-lived tangible asset. The significant assumptions used in estimating the Company’s aggregate asset retirement obligation are: timing of tower removals; cost of tower removals; timing and number of land lease renewals; expected inflation rates; and credit-adjusted, risk-free interest rates that approximate the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. Income Taxes —As a REIT, the Company generally is not subject to U.S. federal income taxes on income generated by its REIT operations as it receives a dividends paid deduction for distributions to stockholders that generally offsets its REIT income and gains. However, the Company remains obligated to pay U.S. federal income taxes on certain earnings and continues to be subject to taxation in its foreign jurisdictions. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements reflect provisions for federal, state, local and foreign income taxes. The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The Company measures deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company periodically reviews its deferred tax assets, and provides valuation allowances if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets. Valuation allowances would be reversed as a reduction to the provision for income taxes if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based on changes in facts and circumstances relevant to the assets’ recoverability. The Company classifies uncertain tax positions as income tax liabilities in Other non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet, unless expected to be paid within one year. The Company reports penalties and tax-related interest expense as a component of the income tax provision and interest income from tax refunds as a component of Interest income in the consolidated statements of operations. Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) —Other comprehensive income (loss) refers to items excluded from net income that are recorded as an adjustment to equity, net of tax. The Company’s other comprehensive income (loss) primarily consisted of changes in fair value of effective derivative cash flow hedges, foreign currency translation adjustments and reclassification of unrealized losses on effective derivative cash flow hedges. The AOCL balance included accumulated foreign currency translation losses of $ 2.8 billion , $ 2.6 billion and $ 2.0 billion as of December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Distributions —As a REIT, the Company must annually distribute to its stockholders an amount equal to at least 90% of its REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain). Generally, the Company has distributed, and expects to continue to distribute, all or substantially all of its REIT taxable income after taking into consideration its utilization of net operating losses (“NOLs”). The amount, timing and frequency of future distributions will be at the sole discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend upon various factors, a number of which may be beyond the Company’s control, including the Company’s financial condition and operating cash flows, the amount required to maintain its qualification for taxation as a REIT and reduce any income and excise taxes that the Company otherwise would be required to pay, limitations on distributions in the Company’s existing and future debt and preferred equity instruments, the Company’s ability to utilize NOLs to offset the Company’s distribution requirements, limitations on its ability to fund distributions using cash generated through its TRSs and other factors that the Board of Directors may deem relevant. Acquisitions —For acquisitions that meet the definition of a business combination, the Company applies the acquisition method of accounting where assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value at the date of each acquisition, and the results of operations are included with those of the Company from the dates of the respective acquisitions. Any excess of the purchase price paid by the Company over the amounts recognized for assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. The Company continues to evaluate acquisitions for a period not to exceed one year after the applicable acquisition date of each transaction to determine whether any additional adjustments are needed to the allocation of the purchase price paid for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. All other acquisitions are accounted for as asset acquisitions and the purchase price is allocated to the net assets acquired with no recognition of goodwill. The purchase price is not subsequently adjusted. F-14 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is typically determined by using either estimates of replacement costs or discounted cash flow valuation methods. When determining the fair value of tangible assets acquired, the Company must estimate the cost to replace the asset with a new asset taking into consideration such factors as age, condition and the economic useful life of the asset. When determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the Company must estimate the applicable discount rate and the timing and amount of future cash flows, including rate and terms of renewal and attrition. Lease —The new lease standard requires leases to be accounted for using a right-of-use model, which recognizes that, at the date of commencement, a lessee has a financial obligation to make lease payments to the lessor for the right to use the underlying asset during the lease term. The lessee recognizes a corresponding right-of-use asset related to this right. On January 1, 2019, the Company elected to adopt the new lease standard using the modified retrospective method applied to lease arrangements that were in place on the transition date. Results for reporting periods beginning January 1, 2019 are presented under the new standard, while prior-period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with accounting under the previously applicable guidance. The Company elected certain available practical expedients which permit the adopter to not reassess certain items upon adoption, including: (i) whether any existing contracts are or contain leases, (ii) the classification of existing leases and (iii) initial direct costs for existing leases. The Company also elected the practical expedient related to easements, which permits carryforward accounting treatment for land easements on existing agreements. The Company recorded a net increase to opening Distributions in excess of earnings in its consolidated balance sheet of $ 24.7 million as of January 1, 2019 due to the cumulative impact of adopting the new lease standard. This adjustment related to right-of-use asset impairments. The Company also recorded a lease liability of $ 6.9 billion and a corresponding right-of-use asset of $ 7.1 billion upon adoption of the new lease standard. Those rights and obligations are primarily related to operating leases for ground space underneath the Company’s communications sites. The right-of-use assets recorded include, among other items, amounts previously classified as prepaid rent, deferred lease acquisition costs, fair value adjustments on acquired leases and long-term deferred rent obligations. Finance leases, which primarily relate to towers, equipment and vehicles, were largely unchanged. There was no significant change to the Company’s consolidated statements of operations resulting from the adoption of this standard. The Company did not elect the practical expedient for short-term leases, which permits an adopter to not apply the lease standard to leases with a remaining maturity of one year or less, and applied the new lease accounting standard to all leases, including short-term leases. In conjunction with the adoption of the new lease accounting guidance, the Company applied the lessor and lessee practical expedient and no longer separates lease and non-lease components within a lease agreement when the timing and pattern of revenue recognition for the components are the same and the combined single lease component is classified as an operating lease. Certain amounts, such as power and fuel and common area maintenance, which were previously reported as non-lease revenue, are now accounted for as lease revenue. Accordingly, the Company has reclassified certain prior-period amounts within its disclosures. Revenue —The Company’s revenue is derived from leasing the right to use its communications sites and the land on which the sites are located (the “lease component”) and from the reimbursement of costs incurred by the Company in operating the communications sites and supporting the tenants’ equipment as well as other services and contractual rights (the “non-lease component”). Most of the Company’s revenue is derived from leasing arrangements and is accounted for as lease revenue unless the timing and pattern of revenue recognition of the non-lease component differs from the lease component. If the timing and pattern of the non-lease component revenue recognition differs from that of the lease component, the Company separately determines the stand-alone selling prices and pattern of revenue recognition for each performance obligation. Revenue related to DAS networks and fiber and other related assets results from agreements with tenants that are not leases. The Company’s revenue from leasing arrangements, including fixed escalation clauses present in non-cancellable lease arrangements, is reported on a straight-line basis over the term of the respective leases when collectibility is probable. Escalation clauses tied to a consumer price index (“CPI”), or other inflation-based indices, and other incentives present in lease agreements with the Company’s tenants are excluded from the straight-line calculation. Total property straight-line revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 were $ 183.5 million , $ 87.6 million and $ 194.4 million , respectively. Non-lease revenue— Non-lease revenue consists primarily of revenue generated from DAS networks, fiber and other property related revenue. DAS networks and fiber arrangements require that the Company provide the tenant the right to use the F-15 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) applicable communications infrastructure. Performance obligations are satisfied over time for the duration of the arrangements. Other property related revenue streams, which include site inspections, are not material on either an individual or consolidated basis. Services revenue— The Company offers tower-related services in the United States. These services include AZP and structural analysis. There is a single performance obligation related to AZP and revenue is recognized over time based on milestones achieved, which are determined based on costs expected to be incurred. Structural analysis services may have more than one performance obligation, contingent upon the number of contracted services. Revenue is recognized at the point in time the services are completed. Some of the Company’s contracts with tenants contain multiple performance obligations. For these arrangements, the Company allocates revenue to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price, which is typically based on the price charged to tenants. Since most of the Company’s contracts are leases, costs to enter into lease arrangements are capitalized under the applicable lease accounting guidance. Costs incurred to obtain non-lease contracts that are capitalized primarily relate to DAS networks and are not material to the consolidated financial statements. The Company has excluded sales tax, value-added tax and similar taxes from non-lease revenue. Revenue is disaggregated by geography in a manner consistent with the Company’s business segments, which are discussed further in note 21. A summary of revenue disaggregated by source and geography is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2019 U.S. Asia Africa Europe Latin America Total Non-lease property revenue $ 255.7 $ 8.8 $ 4.0 $ 5.1 $ 138.2 $ 411.8 Services revenue 115.4 — — — — 115.4 Total non-lease revenue $ 371.1 $ 8.8 $ 4.0 $ 5.1 $ 138.2 $ 527.2 Property lease revenue 3,933.0 1,208.2 579.9 129.5 1,202.5 7,053.1 Total revenue $ 4,304.1 $ 1,217.0 $ 583.9 $ 134.6 $ 1,340.7 $ 7,580.3 Year Ended December 31, 2018 (1) U.S. Asia Africa Europe Latin America Total Non-lease property revenue $ 255.5 $ 7.0 $ 1.1 $ 0.2 $ 102.1 $ 365.9 Services revenue 125.4 — — — — 125.4 Total non-lease revenue $ 380.9 $ 7.0 $ 1.1 $ 0.2 $ 102.1 $ 491.3 Property lease revenue 3,566.6 1,533.5 544.4 141.6 1,162.7 6,948.8 Total revenue $ 3,947.5 $ 1,540.5 $ 545.5 $ 141.8 $ 1,264.8 $ 7,440.1 _______________ (1) Prior-period amounts adjusted with the adoption of the new lease accounting guidance, as applicable. Information about receivables, contract assets and contract liabilities from contracts with tenants is as follows: December 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 (1) Accounts receivable $ 80.5 $ 92.6 Prepaids and other current assets 8.3 7.7 Notes receivable and other non-current assets 21.3 22.2 Unearned revenue (2) 35.0 35.0 Other non-current liabilities (3) 79.0 54.1 _______________ (1) Prior-period amounts adjusted with the adoption of the new lease accounting guidance, as applicable. (2) Excludes $ 56.7 million and $ 55.0 million of capital contributions related to DAS networks as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. (3) Excludes $ 300.2 million and $ 313.6 million of capital contributions related to DAS networks as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. The Company records unearned revenue when payments are received from tenants in advance of the completion of the Company’s performance obligations. Long-term unearned revenue is included in Other non-current liabilities. During the year ended December 31, 2019 , the Company recognized $ 62.2 million of revenue that was included in the Unearned revenue balance as of December 31, 2018 . During the year ended December 31, 2018 , the Company recognized $ 44.4 million of F-16 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) revenue that was included in the Unearned revenue balance as of January 1, 2018 . The Company also recognized revenues of $ 59.2 million and $ 55.4 million during the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , respectively, for capital contributions related to DAS networks. There was $ 0.4 million of revenue recognized from Other non-current liabilities during each of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 . The Company records unbilled receivables, which are included in Prepaids and other current assets, when it has completed a performance obligation prior to its ability to bill under the customer arrangement. Other contract assets are included in Notes receivable and other non-current assets. The Company did not record any change in unbilled receivables attributable to non-lease property revenue recognized during each of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 . The change in contract assets attributable to revenue recognized during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $ 3.1 million and $ 1.5 million , respectively. The Company does not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for agreements (i) with an original expected length of one year or less or (ii) for which it recognizes revenue at the amount to which it has the right to invoice for services performed. Rent Expense and Lease Accounting —Many of the leases underlying the Company’s tower sites have fixed rent escalations, which provide for periodic increases in the amount of ground rent payable by the Company over time. In addition, certain of the Company’s tenant leases require the Company to exercise available renewal options pursuant to the underlying ground lease if the tenant exercises its renewal option. The Company calculates straight-line ground rent expense for these leases based on the fixed non-cancellable term of the underlying ground lease plus all periods, if any, for which failure to renew the lease imposes an economic penalty to the Company such that renewal appears to be reasonably assured. Effective January 1, 2019, the Company adopted the new lease standard using the modified retrospective method applied to lease arrangements that were in place on the transition date. The new lease accounting guidance required the Company to recognize a right-of-use lease asset and lease liability for operating and finance leases. The right-of-use asset is measured as the sum of the lease liability, prepaid or accrued lease payments, any initial direct costs incurred and any other applicable amounts. The calculation of the lease liability requires the Company to make certain assumptions for each lease, including lease term and discount rate implicit in each lease, which could significantly impact the gross lease obligation, the duration and the present value of the lease liability. When calculating the lease term, the Company considers the renewal, cancellation and termination rights available to the Company and the lessor. The Company determines the discount rate by calculating the incremental borrowing rate on a collateralized basis at the commencement of a lease or upon a change in the lease term. Total property straight-line ground rent expense for the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 was $ 44.4 million , $ 57.9 million and $ 62.3 million , respectively. Selling, General, Administrative and Development Expense —Selling, general and administrative expense consists of overhead expenses related to the Company’s property and services operations and corporate overhead costs not specifically allocable to any of the Company’s individual business operations. Development expense consists of costs related to the Company’s acquisition efforts, costs associated with new business initiatives and project cancellation costs. Stock-Based Compensation —Stock-based compensation expense is measured at the accounting measurement date based on the fair value of the award and is generally recognized as an expense over the service period, which typically represents the vesting period. The Company provides for accelerated vesting and extended exercise periods of stock options and restricted stock units upon an employee’s death or permanent disability, or upon an employee’s qualified retirement, provided certain eligibility criteria are met. Accordingly, the Company recognizes compensation expense for stock options and time-based restricted stock units (“RSUs”) over the shorter of (i) the four -year vesting period or (ii) the period from the date of grant to the date the employee becomes eligible for such benefits due to death, disability or qualified retirement, which may occur upon grant. The expense recognized includes the impact of forfeitures as they occur. The Company grants performance-based restricted stock units (“PSUs”) to its executive officers. Threshold, target and maximum parameters are established for a three -year performance period at the time of grant. The metrics are used to calculate the number of shares that will be issuable when the awards vest, which may range from zero to 200 % of the target amounts. The Company recognizes compensation expense for PSUs over the three -year vesting period, subject to adjustment based on the date the employee becomes eligible for retirement benefits as well as performance relative to grant parameters. The fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and the fair value of RSUs and PSUs is based on the fair value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. The Company recognizes all stock-based F-17 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) compensation expense in either Selling, general, administrative and development expense, costs of operations or as part of the costs associated with the construction of the tower assets. In connection with the vesting of restricted stock units, the Company withholds from issuance a number of shares of common stock to satisfy certain employee tax withholding obligations arising from such vesting. The shares withheld are considered constructively retired. The Company recognizes the fair value of the shares withheld in Additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2019 , the Company has withheld from issuance an aggregate of 2.1 million shares, including 0.4 million shares related to the vesting of restricted stock units during the year ended December 31, 2019 . Litigation Costs —The Company periodically becomes involved in various claims and lawsuits that are incidental to its business. The Company regularly monitors the status of pending legal actions to evaluate both the magnitude and likelihood of any potential loss. The Company accrues for these potential losses when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss, or possible range of loss, can be reasonably estimated. Should the ultimate losses on contingencies or litigation vary from estimates, adjustments to those liabilities may be required. The Company also incurs legal costs in connection with these matters and records estimates of these expenses, which are reflected in Selling, general, administrative and development expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Earnings Per Common Share — Basic and Diluted —Basic net income per common share represents net income attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per common share represents net income attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period and any dilutive common share equivalents, including (A) shares issuable upon (i) the vesting of RSUs, (ii) exercise of stock options, and (iii) conversion of the Company’s mandatory convertible preferred stock and (B) shares expected to be earned upon the achievement of the parameters established for PSUs, each to the extent not anti-dilutive. Dilutive common share equivalents also include the dilutive impact of the shares issuable in the ALLTEL transaction, which is described in note 19, through August 30, 2019. The Company uses the treasury stock method to calculate the effect of its outstanding RSUs, PSUs and stock options and used the if-converted method to calculate the effect of its outstanding mandatory convertible preferred stock. Retirement Plan —The Company has a 401(k) plan covering substantially all employees who meet certain age and employment requirements. For the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , the Company matched 100 % of the first 5 % of a participant's contributions. For the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , the Company contributed $ 11.8 million , $ 11.2 million and $ 11.0 million to the plan, respectively. Accounting Standards Updates In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued guidance that modifies how entities measure credit losses on most financial instruments. The new guidance replaces the current ""incurred loss"" model with an ""expected credit loss"" model that requires consideration of a broader range of information to estimate expected credit losses over the lifetime of the asset. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019, and will be applied using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the effective date. Operating lease receivables are not within the scope of this guidance. The Company is finalizing its analysis of the impact of this guidance on its financial statements and does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements. In January 2017, the FASB issued guidance on accounting for goodwill impairments. The guidance eliminates Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test and requires, among other things, recognition of an impairment loss when the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. The loss recognized is limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued guidance on the accounting for implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract. This guidance aligns the accounting for costs incurred to implement a cloud computing arrangement that is a service arrangement with the guidance on capitalizing costs associated with developing or obtaining internal-use software. The Company adopted this guidance prospectively on July 1, 2019. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements.

Total depreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 was $ 905.5 million , $ 883.1 million and $ 835.5 million , respectively. Depreciation expense includes amounts related to finance lease assets for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $ 168.1 million . As of December 31, 2018 , property and equipment included $ 4,369.5 million and $ 1,016.2 million of capital lease assets with related equipment and improvements and accumulated depreciation, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, capital lease assets were primarily classified as towers and land and improvements. As of December 31, 2019 , property and equipment included $ 3,059.7 million and $ 1,140.4 million of finance lease assets and accumulated depreciation, respectively. Information about finance lease-related balances is as follows: F-19 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) As of Finance leases: Classification December 31, 2019 Property and equipment Towers $ 2,695.9 Accumulated depreciation ( 1,062.0 ) Property and equipment, net $ 1,633.9 Property and equipment Buildings and improvements $ 167.0 Accumulated depreciation ( 65.3 ) Property and equipment, net $ 101.7 Property and equipment Land $ 150.9 Property and equipment Equipment $ 45.9 Accumulated depreciation ( 13.1 ) Property and equipment, net $ 32.8 As of December 31, 2019 , the Company had $ 1,575.2 million of perpetual land easements which are not depreciable. 4. LEASES The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at the inception of the agreement. The Company considers an arrangement to be a lease if it conveys the right to control the use of the communications site or ground space underneath a communications site for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The Company is both a lessor and a lessee. Lessor —The Company is a lessor in most of its revenue arrangements, as property revenue is derived from tenant leases of specifically-identified, physically distinct space on the Company’s communications real estate assets. The Company’s lease arrangements with its tenants vary depending upon the region and the industry of the tenant and generally have initial non-cancellable terms of five to ten years with multiple renewal terms. The leases also contain provisions that periodically increase the rent due, typically annually, based on a fixed escalation percentage or an inflationary index, or a combination of both. The Company structures its leases to include financial penalties if a tenant terminates the lease, which serve to disincentivize tenants from terminating the lease prior to the expiration of the lease term. The Company’s leasing arrangements outside of the U.S. may require that the Company provide power to the communications site through an electrical grid connection, diesel fuel generators or other sources and permit the Company to pass through the costs of, or otherwise charge for, these services. Many arrangements require that the communications site has power for a specified percentage of time. In most cases, if delivery of power falls below the specified service level, a corresponding reduction in revenue is recorded. The Company has determined that this performance obligation is satisfied over time for the duration of the lease. The Company typically has more than one tenant on a site and, by performing ordinary course repair and maintenance work, can often lease a site, either through renewing existing agreements or leasing to new tenants, for periods beyond the existing tenant lease term. Accordingly, the Company has minimal risk with respect to the residual value of its leased assets. Communications sites are depreciated over their estimated useful lives, which generally do not exceed twenty years . As of December 31, 2019 , the Company does not have any material related party leases as a lessor. The Company generally does not enter into sales-type leases or direct financing leases. The Company’s leases generally do not include any incentives for the lessee and do not include any lessee purchase options. F-20 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) Historically, the Company has been able to successfully renew its ground leases as needed to ensure continuation of its tower revenue. Accordingly, the Company assumes that it will have access to the land underneath its tower sites when calculating future minimum rental receipts.

Lessee —The Company enters into arrangements as a lessee primarily for ground space underneath its communications sites. These arrangements are typically long-term lease agreements with initial non-cancellable terms of approximately five to ten years with one or more automatic or exercisable renewal periods and specified increases in lease payments upon exercise of the renewal options. The Company typically exercises its ground lease renewal options in order to provide ongoing tenant space on its communications sites through the end of the tenant lease term. Escalation clauses present in operating leases, excluding those tied to CPI or other inflation-based indices, are recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated lease term of the applicable lease. Additionally, the escalations tied to CPI or another inflation-based index are considered variable lease payments. In certain circumstances, the Company enters into revenue sharing arrangements with the ground space owner, which results in variability in lease payments. In most markets outside of the U.S., in the event there are no tenants on the communications site, the Company generally has unilateral termination rights and in certain situations, the lease is structured to allow for termination by the Company with minimal or no penalties. Ground lease arrangements usually include annual escalations and do not contain any residual value guarantees or restrictions on dividends, other financial obligations or other similar terms. The Company has entered into certain transactions whereby at the end of a lease, sublease or similar arrangement, the Company has the option to purchase the corresponding communications sites. These transactions are further described in note 19. The Company’s lease liability is the present value of the remaining minimum rental payments to be made over the remaining lease term, including renewal options reasonably certain to be exercised. The Company also considers termination options and factors those into the determination of lease payments when appropriate. To determine the lease term, the Company considers all renewal periods that are reasonably certain to be exercised, taking into consideration all economic factors, including the F-21 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) communications site’s estimated economic life (generally 20 years ) and the respective lease terms of the Company’s tenants under the existing lease arrangements on such site. As of the adoption date and new lease inception, the Company’s right-of-use asset is equal to its lease liability, plus payments made prior to the commencement date and initial direct costs, net of any impairment losses, lease incentives, fair value adjustments on acquired leases and deferred rent amount recorded under the prior lease accounting guidance. The Company assesses its right-of-use asset and other lease-related assets for impairment, as described in note 1. During the year ended December 31, 2019 , the Company recorded $ 9.9 million of impairment expense related to these assets. As of December 31, 2019 , the Company does not have any material related party leases as a lessee. The Company does not have any sale-leaseback arrangements as lessee and typically does not enter into leveraged leases. The Company leases certain land and office space under operating leases and land and improvements, towers and vehicles under finance leases. As of December 31, 2019 , operating lease assets were included in Right-of-use asset and finance lease assets were included in Property and equipment, net in the consolidated balance sheet. Information about other lease-related balances as of December 31, 2019 is as follows: Operating leases: Right-of-use asset $ 7,357.4 Current portion of lease liability $ 494.5 Lease liability 6,510.4 Total operating lease liability $ 7,004.9 Finance leases: Current portion of lease liability $ 6.7 Lease liability 24.0 Total finance lease liability $ 30.7 As most of the Company’s leases do not specifically state an implicit rate, the Company uses a market-specific incremental borrowing rate consistent with the lease term as of the lease commencement date when calculating the present value of remaining lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate reflects the cost to borrow on a securitized basis in each market. The remaining lease term does not reflect all renewal options available to the Company, only those renewal options that the Company has assessed as reasonably certain of being exercised taking into consideration the economic and other factors noted above. The weighted-average remaining lease terms and incremental borrowing rates as of December 31, 2019 are as follows: Operating leases: Weighted-average remaining lease term (years) 13.1 Weighted-average incremental borrowing rate 6.1 % Finance leases: Weighted-average remaining lease term (years) 15.0 Weighted-average incremental borrowing rate 6.2 % The following table sets forth the components of lease cost for the year ended December 31, 2019 : Year ended December 31, 2019 Operating lease cost $ 1,013.1 Variable lease costs not included in lease liability (1) 261.7 _______________ (1) Includes property tax paid on behalf of the landlord.

F-24 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) The Company’s other intangible assets subject to amortization consisted of the following: As of December 31, 2019 As of December 31, 2018 Estimated Useful Lives (years) Gross Carrying Value Accumulated Amortization Net Book Value Gross Carrying Value Accumulated Amortization Net Book Value Acquired network location intangibles (1) Up to 20 $ 5,150.8 $ ( 1,920.4 ) $ 3,230.4 $ 4,780.3 $ ( 1,704.9 ) $ 3,075.4 Acquired tenant-related intangibles Up to 20 12,674.1 ( 3,674.6 ) 8,999.5 11,156.5 ( 3,147.2 ) 8,009.3 Acquired licenses and other intangibles 3-20 106.7 ( 18.2 ) 88.5 104.1 ( 14.5 ) 89.6 Total other intangible assets $ 17,931.6 $ ( 5,613.2 ) $ 12,318.4 $ 16,040.9 $ ( 4,866.6 ) $ 11,174.3 _______________ (1) Acquired network location intangibles are amortized over the shorter of the term of the corresponding ground lease, taking into consideration lease renewal options and residual value or up to 20 years, as the Company considers these intangibles to be directly related to the tower assets. The acquired network location intangibles represent the value to the Company of the incremental revenue growth that could potentially be obtained from leasing the excess capacity on acquired communications sites. The acquired tenant-related intangibles typically represent the value to the Company of tenant contracts and relationships in place at the time of an acquisition or similar transaction, including assumptions regarding estimated renewals. The Company amortizes its acquired network location intangibles and tenant-related intangibles on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. As of December 31, 2019 , the remaining weighted average amortization period of the Company’s intangible assets was 15 years. Amortization of intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 was $ 791.3 million, $ 1,144.1 million and $ 785.9 million , respectively. Amortization expense decreased for the year ended December 31, 2019 because in 2018, the Company entered into agreements with one of its tenants in India, Tata Teleservices Limited (“Tata Teleservices”) and related entities (collectively, “Tata”), for a settlement and release of certain contractual lease obligations of Tata Teleservices. As a result, the Company recorded $ 327.5 million of accelerated amortization related to the Tata tenant relationship in 2018, which was subsequently retired. Based on current exchange rates, the Company expects to record amortization expense as follows over the next five years: Fiscal Year Amount 2020 $ 885.7 2021 860.1 2022 856.0 2023 852.4 2024 838.1 6. NOTES RECEIVABLE AND OTHER NON-CURRENT ASSETS Notes receivable and other non-current assets consisted of the following: As of December 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 Long-term prepaid ground rent $ — $ 607.5 Notes receivable 1.1 1.0 Other miscellaneous assets 405.3 354.1 Notes receivable and other non-current assets $ 406.4 $ 962.6 The reduction in Long-term prepaid ground rent is a result of the reclassification of assets to the Right-of-use asset in connection with the Company’s adoption of the new lease accounting standard. F-25 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) 7. ACQUISITIONS The Company evaluates each of its acquisitions under the accounting guidance framework to determine whether to treat an acquisition as an asset acquisition or a business combination. For those transactions treated as asset acquisitions, the purchase price is allocated to the assets or rights acquired and liabilities assumed, with no recognition of goodwill. For those transactions treated as business combinations, the estimates of the fair value of the assets or rights acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of the applicable acquisition are subject to adjustment during the measurement period (up to one year from the particular acquisition date). The primary areas of the accounting for the acquisitions that are not yet finalized relate to the fair value of certain tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including tax positions, which may include contingent consideration, residual goodwill and any related tax impact. The fair value of these net assets acquired are based on management’s estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. While the Company believes that such preliminary estimates provide a reasonable basis for estimating the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, it evaluates any necessary information prior to finalization of the fair value. During the measurement period for those acquisitions accounted for as business combinations, the Company will adjust assets or liabilities if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have resulted in the revised estimated values of those assets or liabilities as of that date. Impact of current year acquisitions —The Company typically acquires communications sites and other communications infrastructure assets from wireless carriers or other tower operators and subsequently integrates those sites and related assets into its existing portfolio of communications sites and related assets. The financial results of the Company’s acquisitions have been included in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 from the date of the respective acquisition. The date of acquisition, and by extension the point at which the Company begins to recognize the results of an acquisition, may depend on, among other things, the receipt of contractual consents, the commencement and extent of leasing arrangements and the timing of the transfer of title or rights to the assets, which may be accomplished in phases. Sites acquired from communications service providers may never have been operated as a business and may instead have been utilized solely by the seller as a component of its network infrastructure. An acquisition may or may not involve the transfer of business operations or employees. For those acquisitions accounted for as business combinations, the Company recognizes acquisition and merger related expenses in the period in which they are incurred and services are received; for transactions accounted for as asset acquisitions, these costs are capitalized as part of the purchase price. Acquisition and merger related costs may include finder’s fees, advisory, legal, accounting, valuation and other professional or consulting fees and general administrative costs directly related to completing the transaction. Integration costs include incremental and non-recurring costs necessary to convert data, retain employees and otherwise enable the Company to operate acquired businesses or assets efficiently. The Company records acquisition and merger related expenses for business combinations, as well as integration costs for all acquisitions, in Other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. During the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , the Company recorded acquisition and merger related expenses for business combinations and non-capitalized asset acquisition costs and integration costs as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 Acquisition and merger related expenses $ 26.9 $ 14.1 $ 16.3 Integration costs $ 9.8 $ 16.1 $ 11.5 The Company also received $ 13.1 million related to pre-acquisition contingencies and settlements during the year ended December 31, 2019 . 2019 Transactions The estimated aggregate impact of the acquisitions completed in 2019 on the Company’s revenues and gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2019 was approximately $ 17.6 million and $ 12.7 million , respectively. The revenues and gross margin amounts also reflect incremental revenues from the addition of new tenants to such sites subsequent to the transaction date. Acquisitions completed in 2019 were included in the Company’s U.S, Africa and Latin America property segments. Eaton Towers Acquisition —On December 31, 2019, the Company acquired 100 % of the outstanding shares of Eaton Towers Holdings Limited (“Eaton Towers”), which owns and operates approximately 5,800 communications sites across five African F-26 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) markets (the “Eaton Towers Acquisition”). The total consideration for the Eaton Towers Acquisition, including the Company’s assumption of Eaton Towers’ existing debt, was approximately $ 2.0 billion . The purchase price reflects a $ 9.7 million receivable from the seller for reimbursement of taxes. The Eaton Towers Acquisition was accounted for as a business combination and is subject to post-closing adjustments. Entel Acquisition —On December 19, 2019, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire approximately 3,200 communications sites in Chile and Peru from Entel PCS Telecomunicaciones S.A. and Entel Peru S.A. (“Entel”) for total consideration of approximately $ 0.8 billion (as of the date of signing). On December 26, 2019, the Company completed the acquisition of approximately 2,400 communications sites for an aggregate total purchase price of $ 672.8 million including value-added tax (as of the date of acquisition) (the “Entel Acquisition”). The Entel Acquisition was accounted for as an asset acquisition. The remaining communications sites are expected to close in tranches beginning in the first quarter of 2020, subject to certain closing conditions. U.S. Acquisition— On August 30, 2019, the Company acquired approximately 400 towers and other related property interests in the United States for an aggregate total purchase price of $ 484.2 million . This acquisition was accounted for as an asset acquisition. Other Acquisitions— During the year ended December 31, 2019 , the Company acquired a total of 676 communications sites in the United States, Colombia, Mexico, Paraguay and Peru, as well as other communications infrastructure assets, for an aggregate purchase price of $ 201.8 million . The majority of these acquisitions were accounted for as asset acquisitions. The following table summarizes the allocations of the purchase prices for the fiscal year 2019 acquisitions based upon their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition: Africa Latin America U.S. Eaton Towers Acquisition Entel Acquisition U.S. Acquisition Other (1) Current assets $ 150.4 $ 0.4 $ 4.0 $ 9.3 Property and equipment 304.7 281.0 97.8 66.5 Intangible assets (2): Tenant-related intangible assets 1,007.6 228.9 271.9 65.5 Network location intangible assets 272.2 70.9 111.2 32.0 Other intangible assets — — — 0.8 Other non-current assets 99.5 191.7 55.5 7.8 Current liabilities ( 82.0 ) ( 20.7 ) ( 3.1 ) ( 1.1 ) Deferred tax liability ( 319.3 ) — — Other non-current liabilities ( 138.3 ) ( 79.4 ) ( 53.1 ) ( 13.3 ) Net assets acquired 1,294.8 672.8 484.2 167.5 Goodwill (3) 670.0 — — 34.3 Fair value of net assets acquired 1,964.8 672.8 484.2 201.8 Debt assumed ( 329.8 ) — — — Purchase price $ 1,635.0 $ 672.8 $ 484.2 $ 201.8 _______________ (1) Includes 132 sites in Peru held pursuant to long-term finance leases. (2) Tenant-related intangible assets and network location intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over periods of up to 20 years. (3) The Company expects goodwill to be partially deductible for tax purposes. Other Signed Acquisitions Orange— On November 28, 2019, ATC France, a majority-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into definitive agreements with Orange S.A. for the acquisition of up to approximately 2,000 communications sites in France over a period of up to five years . This transaction is expected to close in multiple tranches beginning in the first half of 2020 for total consideration in the range of approximately 500.0 million Euros (“EUR”) to 600.0 million EUR (approximately $ 550.5 million to $ 660.5 million at the date of signing) to be paid over the five-year term. F-27 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) 2018 Transactions During the year ended December 31, 2019 , the allocation of the final purchase price for the acquisition of Idea Cellular Infrastructure Services Limited was finalized with no material post-closing adjustments.

The 2015 Notes are secured by (i) mortgages, deeds of trust and deeds to secure debt on substantially all of the 3,542 communications sites (the “2015 Secured Sites”) owned by GTP Acquisition Partners and its subsidiaries (the “GTP Entities”) and their operating cash flows, (ii) a security interest in substantially all of the personal property and fixtures of the GTP Entities, including GTP Acquisition Partners’ equity interests in its subsidiaries and (iii) the rights of the GTP Entities under a management agreement. American Tower Holding Sub II, LLC, whose only material assets are its equity interests in GTP Acquisition Partners, has guaranteed repayment of the 2015 Notes and pledged its equity interests in GTP Acquisition Partners as security for such payment obligations. The 2015 Notes were issued by GTP Acquisition Partners pursuant to a Third Amended and Restated Indenture and related series supplements, each dated as of May 29, 2015 (collectively, the “2015 Indenture”), between the GTP Entities and The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee. The effective weighted average life and interest rate of the 2015 Notes was 8.1 years and 3.029 % , respectively, as of the date of issuance. Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2013-2A , Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2018-1, Subclass A and Series 2018-1, Subclass R —On March 29, 2018, the Company completed a securitization transaction (the “2018 Securitization”), in which the American Tower Trust I (the “Trust”) issued $ 500.0 million aggregate principal amount of Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2018-1, Subclass A (the “Series 2018-1A Securities”). To satisfy the applicable risk retention requirements of Regulation RR promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act” and, such requirements, the “Risk Retention Rules”), the Trust issued, and one of the Company’s affiliates purchased, $ 26.4 million aggregate principal amount of Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2018-1, Subclass R (the “Series 2018-1R Securities” and, together with the Series 2018-1A Securities, the “2018 Securities”) to retain an “eligible horizontal residual interest” (as defined in the Risk Retention Rules) in an amount equal to at least 5% of the fair value of the 2018 Securities. The Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2013-2A (the “Series 2013-2A Securities” and, together with the 2018 Securities the “Trust Securities”) issued in a securitization transaction in March 2013 (the “2013 Securitization” and, together with the 2018 Securitization, the “Trust Securitizations”) remain outstanding and are subject to the terms of the Second Amended and Restated Trust and Servicing Agreement entered into in connection with the 2018 Securitization. The assets of the Trust consist of a nonrecourse loan (the “Loan”) made by the Trust to American Tower Asset Sub, LLC and American Tower Asset Sub II, LLC (together, the “AMT Asset Subs”). The AMT Asset Subs are jointly and severally liable under the Loan, which is secured primarily by mortgages on the AMT Asset Subs’ interests in 5,114 broadcast and wireless communications towers and related assets (the “Trust Sites”). The component of the Loan corresponding to the Series 2013-2A Securities also remains outstanding and is subject to the terms of the Second Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement among the Trust and the AMT Asset Subs, dated as of March 29, 2018 (“Loan Agreement”). The Loan Agreement includes terms and conditions, including with respect to secured assets, substantially consistent with the First Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement dated as of March 15, 2013. The 2018 Securities correspond to components of the Loan made to the AMT Asset Subs pursuant to the Loan Agreement and were issued in two separate subclasses of the same series. The 2018 Securities represent a pass-through interest in the components of the Loan corresponding to the 2018 Securities. The Series 2018-1A Securities have an interest rate of 3.652 % and the Series 2018-1R Securities have an interest rate of 4.459 % . The 2018 Securities have an expected life of approximately ten years with a final repayment date in March 2048. Subject to certain limited exceptions described below, no payments of principal will be F-34 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) required to be made on the components of the Loan corresponding to the 2018 Securities prior to the monthly payment date in March 2028, which is the anticipated repayment date for such components. The Loan is secured by (1) mortgages, deeds of trust and deeds to secure debt on substantially all of the Trust Sites and their operating cash flows, (2) a security interest in substantially all of the AMT Asset Subs’ personal property and fixtures and (3) the AMT Asset Subs’ rights under that certain management agreement among the AMT Asset Subs and SpectraSite Communications, LLC entered into in March 2013. American Tower Holding Sub, LLC (the “Guarantor”), whose only material assets are its equity interests in each of the AMT Asset Subs, and American Tower Guarantor Sub, LLC whose only material asset is its equity interests in the Guarantor, have each guaranteed repayment of the Loan and pledged their equity interests in their respective subsidiary or subsidiaries as security for such payment obligations. Under the terms of the Loan Agreement and 2015 Indenture, amounts due will be paid from the cash flows generated by the Trust Sites or the 2015 Secured Sites, respectively, which must be deposited into certain reserve accounts, and thereafter distributed solely pursuant to the terms of the Loan Agreement or 2015 Indenture, as applicable. On a monthly basis, after payment of all required amounts under the Loan Agreement or 2015 Indenture, as applicable, including interest payments, subject to the conditions described below, the excess cash flows generated from the operation of such assets are released to the AMT Asset Subs or GTP Acquisition Partners, as applicable, which can then be distributed to, and used by, the Company. In order to distribute any excess cash flow to the Company, the AMT Asset Subs and GTP Acquisition Partners must each maintain a specified debt service coverage ratio (the “DSCR”), which is generally calculated as the ratio of the net cash flow (as defined in the applicable agreement) to the amount of interest, servicing fees and trustee fees required to be paid over the succeeding 12 months on the principal amount of the Loan or the 2015 Notes, as applicable, that will be outstanding on the payment date following such date of determination. If the DSCR were equal to or below 1.30 x (the “Cash Trap DSCR”) for any quarter, then all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments, fund required reserves, pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and make other payments required under the applicable transaction documents, referred to as excess cash flow, will be deposited into a reserve account (the “Cash Trap Reserve Account”) instead of being released to the AMT Asset Subs or GTP Acquisition Partners, as applicable. The funds in the Cash Trap Reserve Account will not be released to the AMT Asset Subs or GTP Acquisition Partners, as applicable, unless the DSCR exceeds the Cash Trap DSCR for two consecutive calendar quarters. Additionally, an “amortization period” commences if, as of the end of any calendar quarter, the DSCR is equal to or below 1.15 x (the “Minimum DSCR”) and will continue to exist until the DSCR exceeds the Minimum DSCR for two consecutive calendar quarters. With respect to the Trust Securities, an “amortization period” also commences if, on the anticipated repayment date the component of the Loan corresponding to the applicable subclass of the Trust Securities has not been repaid in full, provided that such amortization period shall apply with respect to such component that has not been repaid in full. If either series of the 2015 Notes have not been repaid in full on the applicable anticipated repayment date, additional interest will accrue on the unpaid principal balance of the applicable series of the 2015 Notes, and such series will begin to amortize on a monthly basis from excess cash flow. During an amortization period, all excess cash flow and any amounts in the applicable Cash Trap Reserve Account would be applied to pay the principal of the Loan or the 2015 Notes, as applicable, on each monthly payment date. The Loan and the 2015 Notes may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time, provided such payment is accompanied by the applicable prepayment consideration. If the prepayment occurs within 12 months of the anticipated repayment date with respect to the Series 2015-1 Notes, 18 months of the anticipated repayment date with respect to the Series 2013-2A Securities or the Series 2015-2 Notes, or 36 months of the anticipated repayment date with respect to the Series 2018 Securities, no prepayment consideration is due. The Loan Agreement and the 2015 Indenture include operating covenants and other restrictions customary for transactions subject to rated securitizations. Among other things, the AMT Asset Subs and the GTP Entities, as applicable, are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets subject to customary carve-outs for ordinary course trade payables and permitted encumbrances (as defined in the Loan Agreement or the 2015 Indenture, as applicable). The organizational documents of the AMT Asset Subs and the GTP Entities contain provisions consistent with rating agency securitization criteria for special purpose entities, including the requirement that they maintain independent directors. The Loan Agreement and the 2015 Indenture also contain certain covenants that require the AMT Asset Subs or GTP Acquisition Partners, as applicable, to provide the respective trustee with regular financial reports and operating budgets, promptly notify such trustee of events of default and material breaches under the Loan Agreement and other agreements related to the Trust Sites or the 2015 Indenture and other agreements related to the 2015 Secured Sites, as applicable, and allow the applicable trustee reasonable access to the sites, including the right to conduct site investigations. A failure to comply with the covenants in the Loan Agreement or the 2015 Indenture could prevent the AMT Asset Subs or GTP Acquisition Partners, as applicable, from distributing excess cash flow to the Company. Furthermore, if the AMT Asset Subs or GTP Acquisition Partners were to default on the Loan or a series of the 2015 Notes, the applicable trustee may seek to foreclose F-35 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) upon or otherwise convert the ownership of all or any portion of the Trust Sites or the 2015 Secured Sites, respectively, in which case the Company could lose the revenue associated with those assets. With respect to the 2015 Notes, upon the occurrence and during an event of default, the applicable trustee may, in its discretion or at the direction of holders of more than 50 % of the aggregate outstanding principal of any series of the 2015 Notes, declare such series of 2015 Notes immediately due and payable, in which case any excess cash flow would need to be used to pay holders of such notes. Further, under the Loan Agreement and the 2015 Indenture, the AMT Asset Subs or GTP Acquisition Partners, respectively, are required to maintain reserve accounts, including for ground rents, real estate and personal property taxes and insurance premiums, and, under the 2015 Indenture and in certain circumstances under the Loan Agreement, to reserve a portion of advance rents from tenants on the Trust Sites. Based on the terms of the Loan Agreement and the 2015 Indenture, all rental cash receipts received for each month are reserved for the succeeding month and held in an account controlled by the applicable trustee and then released. The $ 50.2 million held in the reserve accounts with respect to the Trust Securitizations and the $ 13.0 million held in the reserve accounts with respect to the 2015 Securitization as of December 31, 2019 are classified as Restricted cash on the Company’s accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

F-38 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) 12. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS The Company determines the fair value of its financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Below are the three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date. Level 2 Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Items Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis — The fair values of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities that are required to be measured on a recurring basis at fair value were as follows: December 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 Fair Value Measurements Using Fair Value Measurements Using Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Assets: Interest rate swap agreements — $ 9.0 — — — — Embedded derivative in lease agreement — — $ 10.7 — — $ 11.5 Liabilities: Interest rate swap agreements — $ 7.5 — — $ 33.8 — Fair value of debt related to interest rate swap agreements (1) $ 3.3 — — $ ( 31.3 ) — — Redeemable noncontrolling interests (2) — — $ 1,096.5 — — $ 1,004.8 _______________ (1) Included in the carrying values of the corresponding debt obligations. (2) Includes the redeemable noncontrolling interest in ATC TIPL and $ 523.0 million related to the Company’s agreement with MTN to acquire MTN’s noncontrolling interests in each of the Company’s joint ventures in Ghana and Uganda. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2020, subject to regulatory approval and other closing conditions. Interest Rate Swap Agreements The fair value of the Company’s interest rate swap agreements is determined using pricing models with inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, changes in the value of the derivatives are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in the current period, along with the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the Company records the change in fair value for the effective portion of the cash flow hedges in AOCL in the consolidated balance sheets and reclassifies a portion of the value from AOCL into Interest expense on a quarterly basis as the cash flows from the hedged item affects earnings. The Company records the settlement of interest rate swap agreements in (Loss) gain on retirement of long-term obligations in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the settlement occurs. The Company entered into three interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional value of $ 500.0 million related to the 3.000 % senior unsecured notes due 2023 (the “ 3.000 % Notes”). These interest rate swaps, which were designated as fair value hedges at inception, were entered into to hedge against changes in fair value of the 3.000 % Notes resulting from changes in interest rates. The interest rate swap agreements require the Company to pay interest at a variable interest rate of one-month LIBOR plus applicable spreads and to receive fixed interest at a rate of 3.000 % through June 15, 2023. F-39 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) The Company entered into three interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional value of $ 600.0 million related to the 2.250 % senior unsecured notes due 2022 (the “ 2.250 % Notes”). These interest rate swaps, which were designated as fair value hedges at inception, were entered into to hedge against changes in fair value of the 2.250 % Notes resulting from changes in interest rates. The interest rate swap agreements require the Company to pay interest at a variable interest rate of one-month LIBOR plus applicable spreads and to receive fixed interest at a rate of 2.250 % through January 15, 2022. The fair values of the U.S. interest rate swap asset of $ 9.0 million and U.S. interest rate swap liability of $ 7.4 million were included in Other non-current assets and Other non-current liabilities, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2019 . The fair value of the U.S. interest rate swap liability of $ 33.5 million was included in Other non-current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2018 . During the year ended December 31, 2019 , the Company recorded net fair value adjustments of $ 0.5 million related to interest rate swaps and the change in fair value of debt due to interest rate swaps in Other expense in the consolidated statements of operations. One of the Company’s Colombian subsidiaries is party to an interest rate swap agreement with certain lenders under the Colombian Credit Facility (the “Colombia Interest Rate Swap”). The Colombia Interest Rate Swap, which was designated as a cash flow hedge at inception, was entered into to manage exposure to variability in interest rates on debt. The Colombia Interest Rate Swap requires the payment of a fixed interest rate of 5.74 % and pays variable interest at the three-month Inter-bank Rate through the earlier of termination of the underlying debt or April 24, 2021. On October 24, 2019, the aggregate notional amount of the Colombia Interest Rate Swap was increased by 20.0 billion COP ( $ 5.9 million ) and the fixed interest rate was decreased to 5.37 % . As of December 31, 2019, the aggregate notional amount of the Colombia Interest Rate Swap was 60.0 billion COP ( $ 18.3 million ). The fair value of the Colombia Interest Rate Swap as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $ 0.1 million and $ 0.3 million , respectively, and was included in Other non-current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Embedded Derivative in Lease Agreement In connection with the acquisition of communications sites in Nigeria, the Company entered into a site lease agreement where a portion of the monthly rent to be received is escalated based on an index outside the lessor’s economic environment. The fair value of the portion of the lease tied to the U.S. CPI was $ 14.6 million at the date of acquisition and was recorded in Notes receivable and other non-current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the Company’s embedded derivative is determined using a discounted cash flow approach, which takes into consideration Level 3 unobservable inputs, including expected future cash flows over the period in which the associated payment is expected to be received and applies a discount factor that captures uncertainties in the future periods associated with the expected payment. During the year ended December 31, 2019 , the Company recorded $ 0.8 million of fair value adjustments, which were recorded in Other expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests The Company records the carrying amount of the redeemable noncontrolling interests as described in note 15. The fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests is determined using a discounted cash flow approach, which takes into consideration Level 3 unobservable inputs, including expected future cash flows and applies a discount factor that captures uncertainties in the future periods. If required, the Company adjusts the redeemable noncontrolling interests to redemption value on each balance sheet date with changes in redemption value recognized as an adjustment to net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests. The recurring Level 3 fair value measurements of the Company’s embedded derivative in lease agreement, acquisition-related contingent consideration and redeemable noncontrolling interests include the following significant unobservable inputs as of December 31, 2019 : Significant Unobservable Input Range Embedded derivative in lease agreement Discount rate 10.93% - 13.96% Redeemable noncontrolling interests (1) Revenue growth 3.82% - 7.88% Long-term growth rate 4.00% _______________ (1) Represents the significant unobservable inputs used to measure the fair value of the Company’s redeemable noncontrolling interest in ATC TIPL as of December 31, 2019. F-40 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) Items Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis Assets Held and Used —The Company’s long-lived assets are recorded at amortized cost and, if impaired, are adjusted to fair value using Level 3 inputs. During the year ended December 31, 2019 , certain long-lived assets held and used with a carrying value of $ 22.4 billion were written down to their net realizable value as a result of an asset impairment charge of $ 94.2 million . During the year ended December 31, 2018 , certain long-lived assets held and used with a carrying value of $ 22.4 billion were written down to their net realizable value as a result of an asset impairment charge of $ 394.0 million . The asset impairment charges are recorded in Other operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. These adjustments were determined by comparing the estimated fair value utilizing projected future discounted cash flows to be provided from the long-lived assets to the asset’s carrying value. There were no other items measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during the year ended December 31, 2019 . Fair Value of Financial Instruments —The Company’s financial instruments for which the carrying value reasonably approximates fair value at December 31, 2019 and 2018 include cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable and accounts payable. The Company’s estimates of fair value of its long-term obligations, including the current portion, are based primarily upon reported market values. For long-term debt not actively traded, fair value is estimated using either indicative price quotes or a discounted cash flow analysis using rates for debt with similar terms and maturities. As of December 31, 2019 , the carrying value and fair value of long-term obligations, including the current portion, were $ 24.1 billion and $ 25.0 billion , respectively, of which $ 17.5 billion was measured using Level 1 inputs and $ 7.5 billion was measured using Level 2 inputs. As of December 31, 2018 , the carrying value and fair value of long-term obligations, including the current portion, were $ 21.2 billion and $ 21.1 billion , respectively, of which $ 13.4 billion was measured using Level 1 inputs and $ 7.7 billion was measured using Level 2 inputs. 13. INCOME TAXES Beginning in the taxable year ended December 31, 2012, the Company has filed, and intends to continue to file, U.S. federal income tax returns as a REIT, and its domestic TRSs filed, and intend to continue to file, separate tax returns as required. The Company also files tax returns in various states and countries. The Company’s state tax returns reflect different combinations of the Company’s subsidiaries and are dependent on the connection each subsidiary has with a particular state and form of organization. The following information pertains to the Company’s income taxes on a consolidated basis. The income tax provision from continuing operations consisted of the following: Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 Current: Federal $ ( 1.7 ) $ ( 1.4 ) $ ( 0.1 ) State ( 5.0 ) ( 1.8 ) ( 3.8 ) Foreign ( 48.2 ) ( 189.7 ) ( 113.4 ) Deferred: Federal 1.4 4.0 0.2 State 0.5 0.7 1.0 Foreign 53.2 298.3 85.4 Income tax benefit (provision) $ 0.2 $ 110.1 $ ( 30.7 ) The effective tax rate (“ETR”) on income from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the Company’s qualification for taxation as a REIT, as well as adjustments for state and foreign items. As a REIT, the Company may deduct earnings distributed to stockholders against the income generated by its REIT operations. In addition, the Company is able to offset certain income by utilizing its NOLs, subject to specified limitations. In 2019, there was an income tax law change in India that allows companies to elect into an optional concessional tax regime. The new regime allows for a lower effective tax rate from approximately 35% to approximately 25% and no minimum F-41 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) alternative tax, while disallowing the benefit of the minimum alternative tax credits. As a result, the Company recorded a tax benefit of $ 113.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 . In 2018, the income tax benefit was attributable to impairment charges and accelerated amortization on intangible assets taken in India as well as a benefit of $ 85.7 million related to the restructuring of international operations in certain jurisdictions. These benefits were partially offset by the receipt of the payment related to the Tata settlement. In 2015, there was an income tax law change in Ghana that disallowed unused capital allowances to be carried into 2016, which resulted in a charge to income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2015. In 2017, the Ghana Revenue Authority issued Practice Note Number DT/2016/010 (the “Practice Note”), which clarified the Capital Allowance section of the Income Tax Act of 2015. The Practice Note allowed for unused Capital Allowance from 2015 to be treated as a deduction in 2016. As a result, the Company recorded a tax benefit of $ 17.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The December 2017 legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) significantly changed how the U.S. taxes corporations. The Tax Act contained several key provisions including, among other things, a reduction in the corporate income rate from 35% to 21% for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. As a result of this change in tax rate, the rate at which the Company’s deferred tax assets of the Company’s TRSs decreased, resulting in additional tax expense of $ 2.4 million , which did not significantly impact the Company's effective tax rate. Reconciliation between the U.S. statutory rate and the effective rate from continuing operations is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 Statutory tax rate 21 % 21 % 35 % Adjustment to reflect REIT status (1) ( 21 ) ( 21 ) ( 35 ) Foreign taxes 3 ( 8 ) 1 Foreign withholding taxes 3 4 3 Uncertain tax positions 1 — — Changes in tax laws ( 6 ) — ( 2 ) Impact from restructuring ( 1 ) ( 6 ) — Effective tax rate ( 0 )% ( 10 )% 2 % _______________ (1) As a result of the ability to utilize the dividends paid deduction to offset the Company’s REIT income and gains. The domestic and foreign components of income from continuing operations before income taxes are as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 United States $ 1,527.0 $ 1,212.7 $ 971.2 Foreign 389.4 ( 58.1 ) 284.9 Total $ 1,916.4 $ 1,154.6 $ 1,256.1 F-42 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) The components of the net deferred tax asset and liability and related valuation allowance were as follows: December 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 Assets: Operating lease liability $ 878.5 $ — Net operating loss carryforwards 356.6 264.9 Accrued asset retirement obligations 174.9 165.7 Stock-based compensation 5.6 6.3 Unearned revenue 31.7 28.3 Unrealized loss on foreign currency 3.8 12.9 Other accruals and allowances 65.6 78.6 Items not currently deductible and other 26.1 26.2 Liabilities: Depreciation and amortization ( 1,040.3 ) ( 757.0 ) Right-of-use asset ( 865.1 ) — Deferred rent ( 79.7 ) ( 36.9 ) Other — ( 15.3 ) Subtotal ( 442.3 ) ( 226.3 ) Valuation allowance ( 194.2 ) ( 151.9 ) Net deferred tax liabilities $ ( 636.5 ) $ ( 378.2 ) The Company provides valuation allowances if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management assesses the available evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company has provided a valuation allowance of $ 194.2 million and $ 151.9 million , respectively, which primarily relates to foreign items. The increase in the valuation allowance for the year ending December 31, 2019 is due to uncertainty as to the timing of, and the Company’s ability to recover, net deferred tax assets in certain foreign operations in the foreseeable future, offset by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if objective evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight may be given to subjective evidence such as the Company’s projections for growth. A summary of the activity in the valuation allowance is as follows: 2019 2018 2017 Balance as of January 1, $ 151.9 $ 142.0 $ 144.4 Additions (1) 42.5 15.7 11.6 Reversals — — ( 9.1 ) Foreign currency translation ( 0.2 ) ( 5.8 ) ( 4.9 ) Balance as of December 31, $ 194.2 $ 151.9 $ 142.0 _______________ (1) Includes net charges to expense and allowances established due to acquisition. The recoverability of the Company’s deferred tax assets has been assessed utilizing projections based on its current operations. Accordingly, the recoverability of the deferred tax assets is not dependent on material asset sales or other non-routine transactions. Based on its current outlook of future taxable income during the carryforward period, the Company believes that deferred tax assets, other than those for which a valuation allowance has been recorded, will be realized. Despite a mandatory one-time inclusion in U.S. taxable income of accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries under the Tax Act for the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company intends to continue to reinvest foreign earnings indefinitely outside of the U.S. and does not expect to incur any significant additional taxes, including withholding taxes, related to such amounts. F-43 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) At December 31, 2019 , the Company had net federal, state and foreign operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income. If not utilized, the Company’s NOLs expire as follows: Years ended December 31, Federal State Foreign 2020 to 2024 $ — $ 222.3 $ 11.9 2025 to 2029 141.6 285.7 104.8 2030 to 2034 7.0 41.4 19.6 2035 to 2039 3.6 159.5 — Indefinite carryforward 22.8 — 853.8 Total $ 175.0 $ 708.9 $ 990.1 As of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would impact the ETR, if recognized, is $ 158.1 million and $ 93.7 million , respectively. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits for the year ended December 31, 2019 includes additions to the Company’s existing tax positions of $ 72.0 million , which includes $ 63.6 million related to the Eaton Towers Acquisition. The Company expects the unrecognized tax benefits to change over the next 12 months if certain tax matters ultimately settle with the applicable taxing jurisdiction during this timeframe, or if the applicable statute of limitations lapses. The impact of the amount of such changes to previously recorded uncertain tax positions could range from zero to $ 53.0 million . A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits are as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 Balance at January 1 $ 107.7 $ 116.7 $ 107.6 Additions based on tax positions related to the current year 33.3 8.1 7.6 Additions and reductions for tax positions of prior years 37.5 0.3 — Foreign currency ( 1.6 ) ( 8.1 ) 1.9 Reduction as a result of the lapse of statute of limitations ( 1.3 ) ( 2.6 ) ( 0.4 ) Reduction as a result of effective settlements — ( 6.7 ) — Balance at December 31 $ 175.6 $ 107.7 $ 116.7 During the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , the statute of limitations on certain unrecognized tax benefits lapsed and certain positions were effectively settled, which resulted in a decrease of $ 2.5 million , $ 9.3 million and $ 0.4 million , respectively, in the liability for uncertain tax benefits. The Company recorded penalties and tax-related interest expense to the tax provision of $ 10.3 million , $ 8.0 million and $ 5.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. In addition, due to the expiration of the statute of limitations in certain jurisdictions and certain positions that were effectively settled, the Company reduced its liability for penalties and income tax-related interest expense related to uncertain tax positions during the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 by $ 2.7 million , $ 16.2 million and $ 0.6 million , respectively. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , the total amount of accrued income tax-related interest and penalties included in the consolidated balance sheets were $ 26.6 million and $ 19.1 million , respectively. The Company has filed for prior taxable years, and for its taxable year ended December 31, 2019 will file, numerous consolidated and separate income tax returns, including U.S. federal and state tax returns and foreign tax returns. The Company is subject to examination in the U.S. and various state and foreign jurisdictions for certain tax years. As a result of the Company’s ability to carryforward federal, state and foreign NOLs, the applicable tax years generally remain open to examination several years after the applicable loss carryforwards have been used or have expired. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the tax jurisdictions resulting from these examinations. The Company believes that adequate provisions have been made for income taxes for all periods through December 31, 2019 .

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION Summary of Stock-Based Compensation Plans —The Company maintains equity incentive plans that provide for the grant of stock-based awards to its directors, officers and employees. The 2007 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended (the “2007 Plan”), provides for the grant of non-qualified and incentive stock options, as well as restricted stock units, restricted stock and other stock-based awards. Exercise prices for non-qualified and incentive stock options are not less than the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. Equity awards typically vest ratably, generally over four years for RSUs and stock options and three years for PSUs. Stock options generally expire 10 years from the date of grant. As of December 31, 2019 , the Company had the ability to grant stock-based awards with respect to an aggregate of 7.0 million shares of common stock under the 2007 Plan. In addition, the Company maintains an employee stock purchase plan (the “ESPP”) pursuant to which eligible employees may purchase shares of the Company’s common stock on the last day of each bi-annual offering period at a 15 % discount from the lower of the closing market value on the first or last day of such offering period. The offering periods run from June 1 through November 30 and from December 1 through May 31 of each year. During the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , the Company recorded and capitalized the following stock-based compensation expenses: 2019 2018 2017 Stock-based compensation expense - Property $ 1.8 $ 2.4 $ 2.1 Stock-based compensation expense - Services 1.0 0.9 0.8 Stock-based compensation expense - SG&A 108.6 134.2 105.6 Total stock-based compensation expense $ 111.4 $ 137.5 $ 108.5 Stock-based compensation expense capitalized as property and equipment $ 1.6 $ 2.0 $ 1.6 Stock Options —The fair value of each option granted during the period was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model based on the assumptions noted in the table below. The expected life of stock options (estimated period of time outstanding) was estimated using the vesting term and historical exercise behavior of the Company’s employees. The risk-free interest rate was based on the U.S. Treasury yield with a term that approximated the estimated life in effect at the accounting measurement date. The expected volatility of the underlying stock price was based on historical volatility for a period equal to the expected life of the stock options. The expected annual dividend yield was the Company’s best estimate of expected future dividend yield. There were no options granted during the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. Key assumptions used to apply the Black-Scholes option pricing model were as follows (percentages and years disclosed in full amounts): 2017 Range of risk-free interest rate 1.88% - 1.94% Weighted average risk-free interest rate 1.89 % Range of expected life of stock options 5.2 years Range of expected volatility of the underlying stock price 18.95% - 19.45% Weighted average expected volatility of underlying stock price 19.05 % Range of expected annual dividend yield 2.40 % The weighted average grant date fair value per share during the year ended December 31, 2017 was $ 16.84 . The intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 was $ 145.5 million , $ 98.8 million and $ 100.3 million , respectively. As of December 31, 2019 , total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock options was $ 0.7 million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of less than one year . The amount of cash received from the exercise of stock options was $ 94.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 .

(2) PSUs represent the shares above target that are issuable for the 2017 PSUs at the end of the three-year performance cycle based on exceeding the performance metric for the three -year performance period, or 128,254 shares, and the target number of shares issuable at the end of the three -year performance period for the 2019 PSUs, or 114,823 shares. (3) This includes 32,596 and 46,500 of previously vested and deferred RSUs and PSUs, respectively. PSUs consist of shares vested pursuant to the 2016 PSUs. There are no additional shares to be earned related to the 2016 PSUs. (4) Vested and deferred RSUs are related to deferred compensation for certain former employees. The total fair value of RSUs and PSUs that vested during the year ended December 31, 2019 was $ 185.3 million . Restricted Stock Units— As of December 31, 2019 , total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested RSUs granted under the 2007 Plan was $ 120.4 million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately F-46 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) two years . Vesting of RSUs is subject generally to the employee’s continued employment or death, disability or qualified retirement (each as defined in the applicable RSU award agreement). Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units— During the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017, the Company’s Compensation Committee granted an aggregate of 114,823 PSUs (the “2019 PSUs”), 131,311 PSUs (the “2018 PSUs”) and 154,520 PSUs (the “2017 PSUs”), respectively, to its executive officers and established the performance metrics for these awards. Threshold, target and maximum parameters were established for the metrics for a three -year performance period with respect to each of the 2019 PSUs, the 2018 PSUs and the 2017 PSUs and will be used to calculate the number of shares that will be issuable when each award vests, which may range from zero to 200 % of the target amounts. At the end of each three -year performance period, the number of shares that vest will depend on the degree of achievement against the pre-established performance goals. PSUs will be paid out in common stock at the end of each performance period, subject generally to the executive’s continued employment or death, disability or qualified retirement (each as defined in the applicable PSU award agreement). PSUs will accrue dividend equivalents prior to vesting, which will be paid out only in respect of shares that actually vest. During the year ended December 31, 2019 , the Company recorded $ 23.9 million in stock-based compensation expense for equity awards in which the performance goals have been established and were probable of being achieved. The remaining unrecognized compensation expense related to these awards at December 31, 2019 was $ 12.4 million based on the Company’s current assessment of the probability of achieving the performance goals. The weighted-average period over which the cost will be recognized is approximately two years . 15. REDEEMABLE NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS India Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests —On April 21, 2016, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, ATC Asia Pacific Pte. Ltd., acquired a 51 % controlling ownership interest in ATC TIPL (formerly Viom), a telecommunications infrastructure company that owns and operates wireless communications towers and indoor DAS networks in India (the “Viom Acquisition”), which was subsequently merged with the Company’s existing India property operations. In connection with the Viom Acquisition, the Company, through one of its subsidiaries, entered into a shareholders agreement (the “Shareholders Agreement”) with Viom and the following remaining Viom shareholders: Tata Sons Limited (“Tata Sons”), Tata Teleservices, IDFC Private Equity Fund III (“IDFC”), Macquarie SBI Infrastructure Investments Pte Limited and SBI Macquarie Infrastructure Trust (collectively, the “Remaining Shareholders”). The Shareholders Agreement also provides the Remaining Shareholders with put options, which allow them to sell outstanding shares of ATC TIPL to the Company, and the Company with call options, which allow it to buy the noncontrolling shares of ATC TIPL. The put options, which are not under the Company’s control, cannot be separated from the noncontrolling interests. As a result, the combination of the noncontrolling interests and the redemption feature requires classification as redeemable noncontrolling interests in the consolidated balance sheet, separate from equity. The noncontrolling interests become redeemable after the passage of time, and therefore, the Company records the carrying amount of the noncontrolling interests outside of permanent equity at the greater of (i) the initial carrying amount, increased or decreased for the noncontrolling interests’ share of net income or loss and foreign currency translation adjustments, or (ii) the estimated redemption value. If required, the Company will adjust the redeemable noncontrolling interests to the estimated redemption value on each balance sheet date with changes in the estimated redemption value recognized as an adjustment to Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. The Company adjusts the estimated redemption value of the noncontrolling interests based on the operating results of ATC TIPL and previously recorded adjustments to the estimated redemption value. The put options may be exercised, requiring the Company to purchase the Remaining Shareholders’ equity interests, on specified dates through March 31, 2021. The price of the put options will be based on the fair market value of the exercising Remaining Shareholders’ interest in the Company’s India operations at the time the option is exercised. Put options held by certain of the Remaining Shareholders are subject to a floor price of INR 216 per share. During the year ended December 31, 2019 , the Company redeemed 50 % of Tata Teleservices and Tata Sons’ combined holdings of ATC TIPL and 100 % of IDFC’s holdings of ATC TIPL, for a total consideration of INR 29.4 billion ( $ 425.7 million at the date of redemption). As a result of the redemption, the Company’s controlling interest in ATC TIPL increased from 63 % to 79 % and the noncontrolling interest decreased from 37 % to 21 % . F-47 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) In April 2019, Tata Teleservices and Tata Sons delivered notice of exercise of their put options with respect to 100 % of their remaining holdings in ATC TIPL. The Company expects to complete the redemption of the put shares, subject to regulatory approval, for total consideration of INR 24.8 billion (approximately $ 347.6 million at the December 31, 2019 exchange rate) in the first half of 2020. After the completion of the redemption, the Company will hold an approximately 92 % ownership interest in ATC TIPL. Other Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests —During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company entered into an agreement with MTN to acquire MTN’s noncontrolling interests in each of the Company’s joint ventures in Ghana and Uganda for total consideration of approximately $ 523.0 million . The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2020, subject to regulatory approval and other closing conditions. In addition, the Company, through a subsidiary of ATC Europe, entered into an agreement with its local partners in France to form Eure-et-Loir Réseaux Mobiles SAS (“Eure-et-Loir”), a telecommunications infrastructure company that owns and operates wireless communications towers in France. The Company’s controlling interest in Eure-et-Loir is 51 % with local partners holding a 49 % noncontrolling interest. The agreement provides the local partners with put options, which allow them to sell outstanding shares of Eure-et-Loir to the Company, and the Company with call options, which allow it to buy the noncontrolling shares of Eure-et-Loir. The put options, which are not under the Company’s control, cannot be separated from the noncontrolling interests. As a result, the combination of the noncontrolling interests and the redemption feature requires classification as redeemable noncontrolling interests in the consolidated balance sheet, separate from equity. The value of the Eure-et-Loir interests as of December 31, 2019 was $ 2.7 million . The changes in Redeemable noncontrolling interests for the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 were as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 Balance as of January 1, $ 1,004.8 $ 1,126.2 $ 1,091.3 Additions to redeemable noncontrolling interests 525.7 — — Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests 35.8 ( 87.9 ) ( 33.4 ) Adjustment to noncontrolling interest redemption value ( 35.8 ) 86.7 — Adjustment to noncontrolling interest due to merger — ( 28.1 ) — Purchase of redeemable noncontrolling interest ( 425.7 ) — — Foreign currency translation adjustment attributable to noncontrolling interests ( 8.3 ) ( 92.1 ) 68.3 Balance as of December 31, $ 1,096.5 $ 1,004.8 $ 1,126.2 16. EQUITY Dividends —The Company may pay dividends in cash or, subject to certain limitations, in shares of common stock or any combination of cash and shares of common stock. Sales of Equity Securities —The Company receives proceeds from sales of its equity securities pursuant to the ESPP and upon exercise of stock options granted under the 2007 Plan. During the year ended December 31, 2019 , the Company received an aggregate of $ 105.5 million in proceeds upon exercises of stock options and sales pursuant to the ESPP. Stock Repurchase Programs —In March 2011, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program, pursuant to which the Company is authorized to repurchase up to $ 1.5 billion of its common stock (the “2011 Buyback”). In December 2017, the Board of Directors approved an additional stock repurchase program, pursuant to which the Company is authorized to repurchase up to $ 2.0 billion of its common stock (the “2017 Buyback” and, together with the 2011 Buyback, the “Buyback Programs”). During the year ended December 31, 2019 , the Company repurchased 93,654 shares of its common stock under the 2011 Buyback for an aggregate of $ 19.6 million , including commissions and fees. As of December 31, 2019 , the Company had repurchased a total of 14,097,197 shares of its common stock under the 2011 Buyback for an aggregate of $ 1.4 billion , including commissions and fees. There were no repurchases under the 2017 Buyback. Under the Buyback Programs, the Company is authorized to purchase shares from time to time through open market purchases or in privately negotiated transactions not to exceed market prices and subject to market conditions and other factors. With F-48 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) respect to open market purchases, the Company may use plans adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act in accordance with securities laws and other legal requirements, which allows the Company to repurchase shares during periods when it may otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of self-imposed trading blackout periods.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Litigation —The Company periodically becomes involved in various claims, lawsuits and proceedings that are incidental to its business. In the opinion of Company management, after consultation with counsel, there are no matters currently pending that would, in the event of an adverse outcome, materially impact the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Verizon Transaction —In March 2015, the Company entered into an agreement with various operating entities of Verizon Communications Inc. (“Verizon”) that currently provides for the lease, sublease or management of approximately 11,250 wireless communications sites commencing March 27, 2015. The average term of the lease or sublease for all sites at the inception of the agreement was approximately 28 years , assuming renewals or extensions of the underlying ground leases for the sites. The Company has the option to purchase the leased sites in tranches, subject to the applicable lease, sublease or management rights upon its scheduled expiration. Each tower is assigned to an annual tranche, ranging from 2034 to 2047, which represents the outside expiration date for the sublease rights to the towers in that tranche. The purchase price for each tranche is a fixed amount stated in the lease for such tranche plus the fair market value of certain alterations made to the related towers. The aggregate purchase option price for the towers leased and subleased is approximately $ 5.0 billion . Verizon will occupy the sites as a tenant for an initial term of ten years with eight optional successive five -year terms; each such term shall be governed by standard master lease agreement terms established as a part of the transaction. AT&T Transaction —The Company has an agreement with SBC Communications Inc., a predecessor entity to AT&T, that currently provides for the lease or sublease of approximately 2,200 towers commencing between December 2000 and August 2004. Substantially all of the towers are part of the Trust Securitizations. The average term of the lease or sublease for all sites at the inception of the agreement was approximately 27 years , assuming renewals or extensions of the underlying ground leases for the sites. The Company has the option to purchase the sites subject to the applicable lease or sublease upon its expiration. Each tower is assigned to an annual tranche, ranging from 2013 to 2032, which represents the outside expiration date for the sublease rights to that tower. The purchase price for each site is a fixed amount stated in the lease for that site plus the fair market value of certain alterations made to the related tower by AT&T. As of December 31, 2019 , the Company has purchased an aggregate of 228 of the subleased towers upon expiration of the applicable agreement, including 79 towers purchased during F-51 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) the year ended December 31, 2019 for an aggregate purchase price of $ 40.2 million . The aggregate purchase option price for the remaining towers leased and subleased is $ 937.8 million and will accrete at a rate of 10 % per annum through the applicable expiration of the lease or sublease of a site. For all such sites, AT&T has the right to continue to lease the reserved space through June 30, 2020 at the then-current monthly fee, which shall escalate in accordance with the standard master lease agreement for the remainder of AT&T’s tenancy. Thereafter, AT&T shall have the right to renew such lease for up to four successive five -year terms. ALLTEL Transaction —In December 2000, the Company entered into an agreement with ALLTEL Communications, LLC, a predecessor entity to Verizon Wireless, to acquire towers through a 15 -year sublease agreement. Pursuant to the agreement, as amended, with Verizon Wireless, the Company acquired rights to approximately 1,800 towers in tranches between April 2001 and March 2002. The Company had the option to purchase each tower at the expiration of the applicable sublease. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company exercised the purchase options for 1,523 towers in a single closing and provided notice to the tower owner, Verizon’s assignee, of its intent to exercise the purchase options related to the remaining 243 towers. On August 30, 2019, the Company purchased the remaining 243 towers for an aggregate purchase price of $ 43.0 million in cash in lieu of shares of the Company’s common stock. Other Contingencies —The Company is subject to income tax and other taxes in the geographic areas where it operates, and periodically receives notifications of audits, assessments or other actions by taxing authorities. Taxing authorities may issue notices or assessments while audits are being conducted. In certain jurisdictions, taxing authorities may issue assessments with minimal examination. These notices and assessments do not represent amounts that the Company is obligated to pay and are often not reflective of the actual tax liability for which the Company will ultimately be liable. In the process of responding to assessments of taxes that the Company believes are not enforceable, the Company avails itself of both administrative and judicial remedies. The Company evaluates the circumstances of each notification or assessment based on the information available and, in those instances in which the Company does not anticipate a successful defense of positions taken in its tax filings, a liability is recorded in the appropriate amount based on the underlying assessment. On December 5, 2016, the Company received an income tax assessment of Essar Telecom Infrastructure Private Limited (“ETIPL”) from the India Income Tax Department (the “Tax Department”) for the fiscal year ending 2008 in the amount of INR 4.75 billion ( $ 69.8 million on the date of assessment) related to capital contributions. The Company challenged the assessment before the Office of Commissioner of Income Tax - Appeals, which ruled in the Company’s favor in January 2018. However, the Tax Department has appealed this ruling at a higher appellate authority. The Company estimates that there is a more likely than not probability that the Company’s position will be sustained upon appeal. Accordingly, no liability has been recorded. Additionally, the assessment was made with respect to transactions that took place in the tax year commencing in 2007, prior to the Company’s acquisition of ETIPL. Under the Company’s definitive acquisition agreement with ETIPL, the seller is obligated to indemnify and defend the Company with respect to any tax-related liability that may arise from activities prior to March 31, 2010. Guaranties and Indemnifications —The Company enters into agreements from time to time in the ordinary course of business pursuant to which it agrees to guarantee or indemnify third parties for certain claims. The Company has also entered into purchase and sale agreements relating to the sale or acquisition of assets containing customary indemnification provisions. The Company’s indemnification obligations under these agreements generally are limited solely to damages resulting from breaches of representations and warranties or covenants under the applicable agreements. In addition, payments under such indemnification clauses are generally conditioned on the other party making a claim that is subject to whatever defenses the Company may have and are governed by dispute resolution procedures specified in the particular agreement. Further, the Company’s obligations under these agreements may be limited in duration and amount, and in some instances, the Company may have recourse against third parties for payments made by the Company. The Company has not historically made any material payments under these agreements and, as of December 31, 2019 , is not aware of any agreements that could result in a material payment.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS The Company’s primary business is leasing space on multitenant communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, wireless data providers, government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries. This business is referred to as the Company’s property operations. During the fourth quarter of 2019, as a result of recent acquisitions, including the Eaton Towers Acquisition, and changes to its organizational structure, the Company reviewed and changed its reportable segments to divide its EMEA property segment into two segments: Africa property and Europe property. Prior to this revision, the Company operated in five business segments: (i) U.S. property, (ii) Asia property (iii) EMEA property, (iv) Latin America property and (v) services. The change is consistent with how the chief operating decision maker reviews financial performance and operating and business management strategies for each of the six segments. The change in reportable segments had no impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements for any periods. Historical financial information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K has been adjusted to reflect the change in reportable segments. As of December 31, 2019, the Company’s property operations consisted of the following: • U.S.: property operations in the United States; • Asia: property operations in India; • Africa: property operations in Burkina Faso, Ghana, Kenya, Niger, Nigeria, South Africa and Uganda; • Europe: property operations in France and Germany; and • Latin America: property operations in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico, Paraguay and Peru. The Company’s services segment offers tower-related services in the United States, including AZP and structural analysis, which primarily support its site leasing business, including the addition of new tenants and equipment on its sites. The services segment is a strategic business unit that offers different services from, and requires different resources, skill sets and marketing strategies than, the property operating segments. The accounting policies applied in compiling segment information below are similar to those described in note 1. Among other factors, in evaluating financial performance in each business segment, management uses segment gross margin and segment operating profit. The Company defines segment gross margin as segment revenue less segment operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation expense recorded in costs of operations; Depreciation, amortization and accretion; Selling, general, administrative and development expense; and Other operating expenses. The Company defines segment operating profit as segment gross margin less Selling, general, administrative and development expense attributable to the segment, excluding stock-based compensation expense and corporate expenses. For reporting purposes, for periods through September 30, 2018, the Latin America property segment gross margin and segment operating profit also included Interest income (expense), TV F-53 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) Azteca, net. These measures of segment gross margin and segment operating profit are also before Interest income, Interest expense, Gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations, Other income (expense), Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and Income tax benefit (provision). The categories of expenses indicated above, such as depreciation, have been excluded from segment operating performance as they are not considered in the review of information or the evaluation of results by management. There are no significant revenues resulting from transactions between the Company’s operating segments. All intercompany transactions are eliminated to reconcile segment results and assets to the consolidated statements of operations and consolidated balance sheets. Summarized financial information concerning the Company’s reportable segments for the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 is shown in the following tables. The “Other” column (i) represents amounts excluded from specific segments, such as business development operations, stock-based compensation expense and corporate expenses included in Selling, general, administrative and development expense; Other operating expenses; Interest income; Interest expense; Gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations; and Other income (expense), and (ii) reconciles segment operating profit to Income from continuing operations before income taxes.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 2.400 % Senior Notes and 2.900 % Senior Notes Offering —On January 10, 2020, the Company completed a registered public offering of $ 750.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.400 % senior unsecured notes due 2025 and $ 750.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.900 % senior unsecured notes due 2030. The net proceeds from this offering were approximately $ 1,483.4 million , after deducting commissions and estimated expenses. The Company used the net proceeds to repay existing indebtedness under the 2019 Credit Facility. Repayment of 5.900 % Senior Notes —On January 15, 2020, the Company redeemed all of the $ 500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.900 % senior unsecured notes due 2021 (the “ 5.900 % Notes”) at a price equal to 106.7090 % of the F-59 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding January 15, 2020, for an aggregate redemption price of approximately $ 539.6 million , including $ 6.1 million in accrued and unpaid interest. The Company recorded a loss on retirement of long-term obligations of $ 34.6 million , which includes prepayment consideration of $ 33.5 million and the associated unamortized discount and deferred financing costs. The redemption was funded with borrowings under the 2019 Credit Facility and cash on hand. Upon completion of the repayment, none of the 5.900 % Notes remained outstanding. 2020 Term Loan —On February 13, 2020, the Company entered into a $ 750.0 million unsecured term loan (the “2020 Term Loan”), the net proceeds of which were used, together with borrowings under the 2019 Credit Facility and cash on hand, to repay all outstanding indebtedness under the 2019 364 -Day Term Loan. The 2020 Term Loan matures on February 12, 2021. The Company has the option of choosing either a defined base rate or LIBOR as the applicable base rate for borrowings under the 2020 Term Loan. The interest rate on the 2020 Term Loan is 0.65 % above LIBOR for LIBOR based borrowings or 0.00 % above the defined base rate for base rate borrowings. Any outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest will be due and payable in full at maturity. The 2020 Term Loan does not require amortization of principal and may be paid prior to maturity in whole or in part at the Company’s option without penalty or premium. The agreement for the 2020 Term Loan contains certain reporting, information, financial and operating covenants and other restrictions (including limitations on additional debt, guaranties, sales of assets and liens) with which the Company must comply. Any failure to comply with the financial and operating covenants of the loan agreement may constitute a default, which could result in, among other things, the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable.

We have based those forward-looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future results. When we use words such as “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects” or similar expressions, we are making forward-looking statements. Examples of forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements we make regarding future prospects of growth in the communications site leasing industry, the level of future expenditures by companies in this industry and other trends in this industry, the effects of consolidation among companies in our industry and among our tenants and other competitive and financial pressures, changes in zoning, tax and other laws and regulations, economic, political and other events, particularly those relating to our international operations, our future capital expenditure levels, the impact of technology changes on our industry and our business, our ability to maintain or increase our market share, our plans to fund our future liquidity needs, our substantial leverage and debt service obligations, our future financing transactions, our future operating results, our ability to remain qualified for taxation as a real estate investment trust (REIT), the amount and timing of any future distributions including those we are required to make as a REIT, natural disasters and similar events and our ability to protect our rights to the land under our towers. These statements are based on our management’s beliefs and assumptions, which in turn are based on currently available information. These assumptions could prove inaccurate. These forward-looking statements may be found under the captions “Business” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” as well as in this Annual Report generally. ii Table of Contents You should keep in mind that any forward-looking statement we make in this Annual Report or elsewhere speaks only as of the date on which we make it. New risks and uncertainties arise from time to time, and it is impossible for us to predict these events or how they may affect us. In any event, these and other important factors, including those set forth in Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption “Risk Factors,” may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by our forward-looking statements. We have no duty, and do not intend, to update or revise the forward-looking statements we make in this Annual Report, except as may be required by law. In light of these risks and uncertainties, you should keep in mind that the future events or circumstances described in any forward-looking statement we make in this Annual Report or elsewhere might not occur. References in this Annual Report to “we,” “our” and the “Company” refer to American Tower Corporation and its predecessor, as applicable, individually and collectively with its subsidiaries as the context requires. iii Table of Contents PART I ITEM 1. BUSINESS Overview We are one of the largest global real estate investment trusts and a leading independent owner, operator and developer of multitenant communications real estate. Our primary business is the leasing of space on communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, wireless data providers, government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries. We refer to this business as our property operations, which accounted for 98% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 . We also offer tower-related services in the United States, which we refer to as our services operations. These services include site acquisition, zoning and permitting and structural analysis, which primarily support our site leasing business, including the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites. American Tower Corporation was originally created as a subsidiary of American Radio Systems Corporation in 1995 and was spun off into a free-standing public company in 1998. We are a holding company and conduct our operations through our directly and indirectly owned subsidiaries and joint ventures. Our principal domestic operating subsidiaries are American Towers LLC and SpectraSite Communications, LLC. We conduct our international operations primarily through our subsidiary, American Tower International, Inc., which in turn conducts operations through its various international holding and operating subsidiaries and joint ventures. Since inception, we have grown our communications real estate portfolio through acquisitions, long-term lease arrangements and site development. Our portfolio primarily consists of towers that we own and towers that we operate pursuant to long-term lease arrangements, as well as distributed antenna system (“DAS”) networks, which provide seamless coverage solutions in certain in-building and outdoor wireless environments. In addition to the communications sites in our portfolio, we manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements. We also hold other telecommunications infrastructure, fiber and property interests that we lease primarily to communications service providers and third-party tower operators. In 2018, we launched operations in Kenya through our acquisition of communications sites from Telkom Kenya Limited, acquired urban telecommunications assets, including fiber assets in Brazil, and added approximately 20,000 communications sites to our portfolio in India through two acquisitions. As of December 31, 2018 , our communications real estate portfolio of 170,686 communications sites included 40,757 communications sites in the U.S., 75,872 communications sites in Asia, 16,665 communications sites in Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) and 37,392 communications sites in Latin America, as well as urban telecommunications assets in Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and South Africa. We operate as a real estate investment trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes (“REIT”). Accordingly, we generally are not required to pay U.S. federal income taxes on income generated by our REIT operations, including the income derived from leasing space on our towers, as we receive a dividends paid deduction for distributions to stockholders that generally offsets our REIT income and gains. However, we remain obligated to pay U.S. federal income taxes on earnings from our domestic taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRSs”). In addition, our international assets and operations, regardless of their classification for U.S. tax purposes, continue to be subject to taxation in the jurisdictions where those assets are held or those operations are conducted. The use of TRSs enables us to continue to engage in certain businesses while complying with REIT qualification requirements. We may, from time to time, change the election of previously designated TRSs to be included as part of the REIT. As of December 31, 2018 , our REIT-qualified businesses included our U.S. tower leasing business, our operations in Nigeria, most of our operations in Costa Rica and Mexico, a majority of our operations in Germany and a majority of our indoor DAS networks business and services segment. In January 2019, a majority of our operations in France became part of the REIT. We report our results in five segments – U.S. property, Asia property, EMEA property, Latin America property and services. 1 Table of Contents Products and Services Property Operations Our property operations accounted for 98% , 99% and 99% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Our revenue is primarily generated from tenant leases. Our tenants lease space on our communications real estate, where they install and maintain their equipment. Rental payments vary considerably depending upon numerous factors, including, but not limited to, amount, type and position of tenant equipment on the tower, remaining tower capacity and tower location. Our costs typically include ground rent (which is primarily fixed under long-term lease agreements with annual cost escalations) and power and fuel costs, some or all of which may be passed through to our tenants, as well as property taxes and repair and maintenance expenses. Our property operations have generated consistent growth in revenue and typically have low cash flow volatility due to the following characteristics: • Long-term tenant leases with contractual rent escalations. In general, a tenant lease has an initial non-cancellable term of ten years with multiple renewal terms, with provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease, typically annually, based on a fixed escalation percentage (averaging approximately 3% in the United States) or an inflationary index in our international markets, or a combination of both. Based upon foreign currency exchange rates and the tenant leases in place as of December 31, 2018 , we expect to generate nearly $35 billion of non-cancellable tenant lease revenue over future periods, absent the impact of straight-line lease accounting. • Consistent demand for our sites. As a result of rapidly growing usage of mobile data and other wireless services and the corresponding wireless industry capital spending trends in the markets we serve, we anticipate consistent demand for our communications sites. We believe that our global asset base positions us well to benefit from the increasing proliferation of advanced wireless devices and the increasing usage of high bandwidth applications on those devices. We have the ability to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our sites, which typically results in incremental revenue and modest incremental costs. Our site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with a solid platform for new business opportunities, which has historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth. • High lease renewal rates. Our tenants tend to renew leases because suitable alternative sites may not exist or be available and repositioning a site in their network may be expensive and may adversely affect network quality. Historically, churn has averaged approximately 1% to 2% of tenant billings per year. We define churn as tenant billings lost when a tenant cancels or does not renew its lease or, in limited circumstances, when the lease rates on existing leases are reduced. We derive our churn rate for a given year by dividing our tenant billings lost on this basis by our prior-year tenant billings. As discussed in Item 7 of this Annual Report under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Executive Overview,” we experienced an increase in churn in 2018 due to carrier consolidation-driven churn in India, and we expect this impact to continue in 2019. • High operating margins. Incremental operating costs associated with adding new tenants to an existing communications site are relatively minimal. Therefore, as tenants are added, the substantial majority of incremental revenue flows through to gross margin and operating profit. In addition, in many of our international markets certain expenses, such as ground rent or power and fuel costs, are reimbursed or shared by our tenant base. • Low maintenance capital expenditures. On average, we require relatively low amounts of annual capital expenditures to maintain our communications sites. Our property business includes the operation of communications sites and managed networks, the leasing of property interests, the operation of fiber and the provision of backup power through shared generators. Our presence in a number of markets at different relative stages of wireless development provides us with significant diversification and long-term growth potential. Our property segments accounted for the following percentage of consolidated total revenue for the years ended December 31,: 2018 2017 2016 U.S. 51 % 55 % 59 % Asia 21 % 17 % 14 % EMEA 9 % 9 % 9 % Latin America 17 % 18 % 17 % Communications Sites. Approximately 96%, 97% and 95% of revenue in our property segments was attributable to our communications sites for the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. 2 Table of Contents We lease space on our communications sites to tenants providing a diverse range of communications services, including cellular voice and data, broadcasting, mobile video and a number of other applications. In addition, in many of our international markets, we receive additional pass-through revenue from our tenants to cover certain costs, including power and fuel costs and ground rent. Our top tenants by revenue for each region are as follows for the year ended December 31, 2018 : • U.S.: AT&T; Verizon Wireless; Sprint; and T-Mobile US accounted for an aggregate of 88% of U.S. property segment revenue. • Asia: Bharti Airtel Limited (“Airtel”); Tata Teleservices Limited (“Tata Teleservices”); Idea Cellular Limited (“Idea”) and Vodafone India Limited and Vodafone Mobile Services Limited (together, “Vodafone”); and Reliance Jio accounted for an aggregate of 95% of Asia property segment revenue. As discussed in Item 7 of this Annual Report under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Executive Overview,” we expect that Tata Teleservices will no longer be a top tenant in 2019. • EMEA: MTN Group Limited and Airtel accounted for an aggregate of 59% of EMEA property segment revenue. • Latin America: Telefónica S.A.; AT&T; and Telecom Italia accounted for an aggregate of 55% of Latin America property segment revenue. Accordingly, we are subject to certain risks, as set forth in Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption “Risk Factors—A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of tenants, and we are sensitive to changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our tenants.” In addition, we are subject to risks related to our international operations, as set forth under the caption “Risk Factors—Our foreign operations are subject to economic, political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position, including risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.” Managed Networks, Property Interests, Fiber and Shared Generators. In addition to our communications sites, we also own and operate several types of managed network solutions, provide communications site management services to third parties, manage and lease property interests under carrier or other third-party communications sites, lease fiber and provide back-up power sources to tenants at our sites. The balance of our property segment revenue not attributable to our communications sites was attributable to these items. • Managed Networks. We own and operate DAS networks in the United States and certain international markets. We obtain rights from property owners to install and operate in-building DAS networks, and we grant rights to wireless service providers to attach their equipment to our installations. We also offer a small portfolio of outdoor DAS networks as a complementary shared infrastructure solution for our tenants in the United States and in certain international markets. Typically, we have designed, built and operated our outdoor DAS networks in areas in which zoning restrictions or other barriers may prevent or delay deployment of more traditional wireless communications sites. We also hold lease rights and easement interests on rooftops capable of hosting communications equipment in locations where towers are generally not a viable solution based on area characteristics. In addition, we provide management services to property owners in the United States who elect to retain full rights to their property while simultaneously marketing the rooftop for wireless communications equipment installation. As the demand for advanced wireless services in urban markets evolves, we continue to evaluate a variety of infrastructure solutions, including small cells and other network architectures that may support our tenants’ networks in these areas. • Fiber. We own and operate fiber in Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and South Africa, which we currently lease to communications and internet service providers and third-party operators to support their telecommunications infrastructure. We expect to continue to evaluate opportunities to invest in and lease these and other similar assets to providers and operators in the future for additional fourth generation (4G) and fifth generation (5G) deployments. • Property Interests . We own a portfolio of property interests in the United States under carrier or other third-party communications sites, which provides recurring cash flow under complementary leasing arrangements. • Shared Generators . We have contracts with certain of our tenants in the United States pursuant to which we provide access to shared backup power generators. Services Operations We offer tower-related services in the United States, including site acquisition, zoning and permitting and structural analysis services. Our services operations primarily support our site leasing business, including through the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites. This segment accounted for 2% , 1% and 1% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. 3 Table of Contents Site Acquisition, Zoning and Permitting . We engage in site acquisition services on our own behalf in connection with our tower development projects, as well as on behalf of our tenants. We typically work with our tenants’ engineers to determine the geographic areas where new communications sites will best address the tenants’ needs and meet their coverage objectives. Once a new site is identified, we acquire the rights to the land or structure on which the site will be constructed, and we manage the permitting process to ensure all necessary approvals are obtained to construct and operate the communications site. Structural Analysis. We offer structural analysis services to wireless carriers in connection with the installation of their communications equipment on our towers. Our team of engineers can evaluate whether a tower structure can support the additional burden of the new equipment or if an upgrade is needed, which enables our tenants to better assess potential sites before making an installation decision. Our structural analysis capabilities enable us to provide higher quality service to our existing tenants by, among other things, reducing the time required to achieve on-air readiness, while also providing opportunities to offer structural analysis services to third parties. Strategy Operational Strategy As the use of wireless services on handsets, tablets and other advanced mobile devices grows and evolves, there is a corresponding increase in demand for the communications infrastructure required to deploy current and future generations of wireless communications technologies. To capture this demand, our primary operational focus is to (i) increase the occupancy of our existing communications real estate portfolio to support global connectivity, (ii) invest in and selectively grow our communications real estate portfolio, (iii) further improve upon our operational performance and efficiency, including through innovation initiatives and (iv) maintain a strong balance sheet. We believe these efforts to meet our tenants’ needs will support and enhance our ability to capitalize on the growth in demand for wireless infrastructure. In addition, we expect to explore new opportunities to enhance or extend our shared communications infrastructure businesses, including those that may make our assets incrementally more attractive to new tenants, or to existing tenants for new uses, and those that increase our operational efficiency. • Increase the occupancy of our existing communications real estate portfolio to support global connectivity. We believe that our highest incremental returns will be achieved by leasing additional space on our existing communications sites. Increasing demand for wireless services in our served markets has resulted in significant capital spending by major wireless carriers and other connectivity providers. As a result, we anticipate consistent demand for our communications sites because they are attractively located and typically have capacity available for additional tenants. In the United States, incremental carrier network activity is being driven primarily by the construction and densification of 4G networks, while in our international markets, carriers are deploying a combination of second generation (2G), third generation (3G) and, more recently, 4G networks, depending on the specific market. We believe that the majority of our towers have capacity for additional tenants and that substantially all of our towers that are currently at or near full structural capacity can be upgraded or augmented to meet future tenant demand with relatively modest capital investment. Therefore, we will continue to target our sales and marketing activities to increase the utilization and return on investment of our existing communications sites. • Invest in and selectively grow our communications real estate portfolio to meet our tenants’ needs. We seek opportunities to invest in and grow our operations through our capital expenditure program, new site construction and acquisitions. We believe we can achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns by pursuing such investments. In addition, we seek to secure property interests under our communications sites to improve operating margins as we reduce our cash operating expense related to ground leases. A significant portion of our inorganic growth has been focused on properties with lower initial tenancy because we believe that over time we can significantly increase tenancy levels, and therefore, drive strong returns on those assets. • Further improve upon our operational performance and efficiency, including through innovation initiatives. We continue to seek opportunities to improve our operational performance throughout the organization. This includes investing in our systems and people as we strive to improve efficiency and provide superior service to our tenants. To achieve this, we intend to continue to focus on customer service initiatives, such as reducing cycle times for key functions, including lease processing and tower structural analysis. We are also focused on developing and implementing renewable power solutions across our footprint to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and help improve the overall efficiency of the communications infrastructure and wireless industries. • Maintain a strong balance sheet. We remain committed to disciplined financial policies, which we believe result in our ability to maintain a strong balance sheet and will support our overall strategy and focus on asset growth and operational excellence. As a result of these policies, we currently have investment grade credit ratings. We continue to focus on maintaining a robust liquidity position and, as of December 31, 2018 , had $4.3 billion of available liquidity. 4 Table of Contents We believe that our investment grade credit ratings provide us consistent access to the capital markets and our liquidity provides us the ability to selectively invest in our portfolio. Capital Allocation Strategy The objective of our capital allocation strategy is to simultaneously increase adjusted funds from operations and our return on invested capital over the long term. To maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT, we are required annually to distribute an amount equal to at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain) to our stockholders. After complying with our REIT distribution requirements, we plan to continue to allocate our available capital among investment alternatives that meet or exceed our return on investment criteria, while taking into account the repayment of debt consistent with our financial policies. • Capital expenditure program. We expect to continue to invest in and expand our existing communications real estate portfolio through our annual capital expenditure program. This includes capital expenditures associated with site maintenance, increasing the capacity of our existing sites and projects such as new site construction, land interest acquisitions and power solutions. • Acquisitions. We intend to pursue acquisitions of communications sites in our existing or new markets where we can meet or exceed our risk-adjusted return on investment criteria. Our risk-adjusted hurdle rates consider additional factors such as the country and counterparties involved, investment and economic climate, legal and regulatory conditions and industry risk, among others. • Return excess capital to stockholders . If we have excess capital available after funding (i) our required distributions, (ii) capital expenditures, (iii) the repayment of debt consistent with our financial policies and (iv) anticipated future investments, including acquisition and select innovation opportunities, we will seek to return such excess capital to stockholders, including through our stock repurchase programs. International Growth Strategy We believe that, in certain international markets, we can create substantial value by either establishing a new, or expanding our existing, communications real estate leasing business. Therefore, we expect we will continue to seek international growth opportunities where we believe our risk-adjusted return objectives can be achieved. We strive to maintain a diversified approach to our international growth strategy by operating in a geographically diverse array of markets in a variety of stages of wireless network development. Our international growth strategy includes a disciplined, individualized market evaluation, in which we conduct the following analyses, among others: • Country analysis. Prior to entering a new market, we conduct an extensive review of the country’s historical and projected macroeconomic fundamentals, including inflation and foreign currency exchange rate trends, demographics, capital markets, tax regime and investment alternatives, and the general business, political and legal environments, including property rights and regulatory regime. • Wireless industry analysis. To confirm the presence of sufficient demand to support an independent tower leasing model, we analyze the competitiveness of the country’s wireless market. This includes an evaluation of the industry’s pricing environment, past and potential consolidation and the stage of its wireless network development. Characteristics that result in an attractive investment opportunity include (i) multiple competitive wireless service providers who are actively seeking to invest in deploying voice and data networks and (ii) ongoing or expected deployment of incremental spectrum from recent or anticipated auctions. • Opportunity and counterparty analysis. Once an investment opportunity is identified within a geographic area with an attractive wireless industry, we conduct a multifaceted opportunity and counterparty analysis. This includes evaluating (i) the type of transaction, (ii) its ability to meet our risk-adjusted return criteria given the country and the counterparties involved, including the anticipated anchor tenant and (iii) how the transaction fits within our long-term strategic objectives, including future potential investment and expansion within the region. Regulatory Matters Towers, Antennas and Fiber. Our U.S. and international tower leasing businesses are subject to national, state and local regulatory requirements with respect to the registration, siting, construction, lighting, marking and maintenance of our towers. In the United States, which accounted for 52% of our total property segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 , the construction of new towers or modifications to existing towers may require pre-approval by the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) and the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”), depending on factors such as tower height and proximity to public airfields. Towers requiring pre-approval must be registered with the FCC and maintained in accordance 5 Table of Contents with FAA standards. Similar requirements regarding pre-approval of the construction and modification of towers are imposed by regulators in other countries. Non-compliance with applicable tower-related requirements may lead to monetary penalties or site deconstruction orders. Certain of our international operations are subject to regulatory requirements with respect to licensing, registration, permitting and public listings. In India, each of our operating subsidiaries holds an Infrastructure Provider Category-I (“IP-I”) Registration Certificate issued by the Indian Ministry of Communications and Information Technology, which permits us to provide tower space to companies licensed as telecommunications service providers under the Indian Telegraph Act of 1885. As a condition to the IP-I, the Indian government has the right to take over telecommunications infrastructure in the case of emergency or war. Additionally, in 2018, ATC Telecom Infrastructure Private Limited (“ATC TIPL”) issued non-convertible debentures, which are listed on the National Stock Exchange of India. Although the debt is held by another subsidiary of ours and is eliminated in consolidation, ATC TIPL is still subject to the listing requirements of such exchange. In Ghana, our subsidiary holds a Communications Infrastructure License, issued by the National Communications Authority (“NCA”), which permits us to establish and maintain passive telecommunications infrastructure services and DAS networks for communications service providers licensed by the NCA. In Uganda, our subsidiary holds a Public Infrastructure Service License, issued by the Uganda Communications Commission (“UCC”), which permits us to establish and maintain passive telecommunications infrastructure and DAS networks for communication service providers licensed by the UCC. In Nigeria, our subsidiary holds a license for Infrastructure Sharing and Collocation Services, issued by the Nigerian Communications Authority (“NCC”), which permits us to establish and maintain passive telecommunications infrastructure for communication service providers licensed by the NCC. In Kenya, our subsidiary holds a “Network Facilities Provider License”, issued by the Communications Authority of Kenya (“CA”), which permits us to establish and maintain passive telecommunications infrastructure services. In Chile, our subsidiary is classified as a Telecom Intermediate Service Provider. We have received a number of site specific concessions and are working with the Chilean Subsecretaria de Telecommunicaciones to receive concessions on our remaining sites in Chile. Comunicaciones y Consumos, S.A. holds a telecom license for a number of services it provides and is regulated by the Ente Nacional de Comunicaciones (ENACOM) in Argentina. In many of the markets in which we operate we are required to provide tower space to service providers on a non-discriminatory basis, subject to the negotiation of mutually agreeable terms. Our international business operations may be subject to increased licensing fees or ownership restrictions. For example, in South Africa, the Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment Act, 2003 (the “BBBEE Act”) has established a legislative framework for the promotion of economic empowerment of South African citizens disadvantaged by Apartheid. Accordingly, the BBBEE Act and related codes measure BBBEE Act compliance and good corporate practice by the inclusion of certain ownership, management control, employment equity and other metrics for companies that do business there. In Kenya, the CA requires all holders of a commercial license to issue at least 20% of their shares to Kenyans within three years of receiving the license unless a waiver is obtained. In addition, certain municipalities have sought to impose permit fees based upon structural or operational requirements of towers and certain regional and other governmental bodies have sought to impose levies or other forms of fees. Our foreign operations may be affected if a country’s regulatory authority restricts, revokes or modifies spectrum licenses of certain wireless service providers or implements limitations on foreign ownership. In all countries where we operate, we are subject to zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by local authorities or community organizations. While these regulations vary, they typically require tower owners or tenants to obtain approval from local authorities or community standards organizations prior to tower construction or the addition of a new antenna to an existing tower. Local zoning authorities and community residents often oppose construction in their communities, which can delay or prevent new tower construction, new antenna installation or site upgrade projects, thereby limiting our ability to respond to tenant demand. This opposition and existing or new zoning regulations can increase costs associated with new tower construction, tower modifications or additions of new antennas to a site or site upgrades, as well as adversely affect the associated timing or cost of such projects. Further, additional regulations may be adopted that cause delays or result in additional costs to us or changes in the competitive landscape that may negatively affect our business. These factors could materially and adversely affect our operations. In the United States, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 prohibits any action by state and local authorities that would discriminate between different providers of wireless services or ban altogether the construction, modification or placement of communications sites. It also prohibits state or local restrictions based on the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent the facilities comply with FCC regulations. Further, in February 2012, the United States government adopted regulations requiring that local and state governments approve modifications or colocations that qualify as eligible facilities under the regulations. Portions of our business are subject to additional regulations, for example, in a number of states throughout the United States, certain of our subsidiaries hold Competitive Local Exchange Carrier (CLEC) or other status, in connection with the operation of our outdoor DAS networks business. In addition, we, or our tenants, may be subject to new regulatory policies in 6 Table of Contents certain jurisdictions from time to time that may materially and adversely affect our business or the demand for our communications sites. In Mexico, our subsidiaries that hold our fiber business are regulated by the Federal Institute of Telecommunications as concession holders and permit holders authorized to provide telecommunications services. Environmental Matters. Our U.S. and international operations are subject to various national, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the management, use, storage, disposal, emission and remediation of, and exposure to, hazardous and non-hazardous substances, materials and wastes and the siting of our towers. We may be required to obtain permits, pay additional property taxes, comply with regulatory requirements and make certain informational filings related to hazardous substances or devices used to provide power such as batteries, generators and fuel at our sites. Violations of these types of regulations could subject us to fines or criminal sanctions. Additionally, in the United States and in other countries where we operate, before constructing a new tower or adding an antenna to an existing site, we must review and evaluate the impact of the action to determine whether it may significantly affect the environment and whether we must disclose any significant impacts in an environmental assessment. If a tower or new antenna might have a material adverse impact on the environment, FCC or other governmental approval of the tower or antenna could be significantly delayed. Health and Safety. In the United States and in other countries where we operate, we are subject to various national, state and local laws regarding employee health and safety, including protection from radio frequency exposure. Competition Our industry is highly competitive. We compete, both for new business and for the acquisition of assets, with other public tower companies, such as Crown Castle International Corp., SBA Communications Corporation, Telesites S.A.B. de C.V. and Cellnex Telecom, S.A., wireless carrier tower consortia such as Indus Towers Limited and private tower companies, private equity sponsored firms, carrier-affiliated tower companies, independent wireless carriers, tower owners, broadcasters and owners of non-communications sites, including rooftops, utility towers, water towers and other alternative structures. We believe that site location and capacity, network density, price, quality and speed of service have been, and will continue to be, significant competitive factors affecting owners, operators and managers of communications sites. Our services business competes with a variety of companies offering individual, or combinations of, competing services. The field of competitors includes site acquisition consultants, zoning consultants, real estate firms, right-of-way consultants, structural engineering firms, tower owners/managers, telecommunications equipment vendors who can provide turnkey site development services through multiple subcontractors and our tenants’ personnel. We believe that our tenants base their decisions for services on various criteria, including a company’s experience, local reputation, price and time for completion of a project. For more information on demand trends in our industry, see Item 7 of this Annual Report under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Executive Overview.” Employees As of December 31, 2018 , we employed 5,026 full-time individuals and consider our employee relations to be satisfactory. 7 Table of Contents Available Information Our internet website address is www.americantower.com .

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS A significant decrease in leasing demand for our communications infrastructure would materially and adversely affect our business and operating results, and we cannot control that demand. A significant reduction in leasing demand for our communications infrastructure could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. Factors that may affect such demand include: • increased mergers or consolidations that reduce the number of wireless service providers or use of network sharing among governments or wireless service providers; • zoning, environmental, health, tax or other government regulations or changes in the application and enforcement thereof; • the financial condition of wireless service providers; • governmental licensing of spectrum or restriction or revocation of our tenants’ spectrum licenses; • a decrease in consumer demand for wireless services, including due to general economic conditions or disruption in the financial and credit markets; • the ability and willingness of wireless service providers to maintain or increase capital expenditures on network infrastructure; • delays or changes in the deployment of next generation wireless technologies; and • technological changes. Increasing competition within our industry may materially and adversely affect our revenue. Our industry is highly competitive and our tenants have numerous alternatives in leasing antenna space. Pricing competition from peers could materially and adversely affect our lease rates. We may not be able to renew existing tenant leases or enter into new tenant leases, or if we are able to renew or enter into new leases, they may be at rates lower than our current rates or on less favorable terms than our current terms, resulting in a material adverse impact on our results of operations and growth rate. In addition, should inflation rates exceed our fixed escalator percentages in markets where our leases include fixed escalators, our income could be adversely affected. If our tenants consolidate their operations, exit the telecommunications business or share site infrastructure to a significant degree, our growth, revenue and ability to generate positive cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Significant consolidation among our tenants could reduce demand for our communications infrastructure and may materially and adversely affect our growth and revenues. Certain combined companies have rationalized duplicative parts of their networks or modernized their networks, and these and other tenants could determine not to renew, or attempt to cancel, avoid or limit leases with us or related payments. In the event a tenant terminates its business or separately sells its spectrum, 8 Table of Contents we may experience increased churn as a result. Our ongoing contractual revenues and our future results may be negatively impacted if a significant number of these leases are terminated or not renewed. For example, see our discussion of carrier consolidation-driven churn in our Asia segment in Item 7 of this Annual Report, under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Executive Overview.” In addition, extensive sharing of site infrastructure, roaming or resale arrangements among wireless service providers as an alternative to leasing our communications sites, without compensation to us, may cause new lease activity to slow if carriers utilize shared equipment rather than deploy new equipment, or may result in the decommissioning of equipment on certain existing sites because portions of the tenants’ networks may become redundant. Our business is subject to government and tax regulations and changes in current or future laws or regulations could restrict our ability to operate our business as we currently do or impact our competitive landscape. Our business and those of our tenants are subject to federal, state, local and foreign regulations. In certain jurisdictions, these regulations could be applied or enforced retroactively, which could require that we modify or dismantle existing towers at significant cost. Zoning authorities and community organizations are often opposed to the construction of communications sites in their communities, which can delay, prevent or increase the cost of new tower construction, modifications, additions of new antennas to a site or site upgrades, thereby limiting our ability to respond to tenant demands. Existing or new regulatory policies, zoning regulations or construction laws may materially and adversely affect the timing, cost or completion of construction projects associated with our communications sites or result in changes in the competitive landscape that may negatively affect our business. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants or result in decreased revenue due to removal of towers to ensure compliance. In addition, in certain jurisdictions, we are required to pay annual license fees, which may be subject to substantial increases by the government, or new fees may be enacted and applied retroactively. Governmental licenses may also be subject to periodic renewal and additional conditions to receive or maintain such license. Furthermore, the tax laws, regulations and interpretations governing our business in jurisdictions where we operate may change at any time, potentially with retroactive effect. This includes changes in tax laws, administrative guidance or judicial interpretations thereof. In addition, some of these changes could have a more significant impact on us as a REIT relative to other REITs due to the nature of our business and our use of TRSs. These factors could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. Our foreign operations are subject to economic, political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position, including risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Our international business operations and our expansion into new markets in the future expose us to potential adverse financial and operational problems not typically experienced in the United States. We anticipate that revenues from our international operations will continue to grow. Accordingly, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally, including: • uncertain, inconsistent or changing laws, regulations, rulings or methodologies impacting our existing and anticipated international operations, fees or other requirements directed specifically at the ownership and operation of communications sites or our international acquisitions, any of which laws, fees or requirements may be applied retroactively or with significant delay, or failure to retain our tax status or to obtain an expected tax status for which we have applied; • expropriation or governmental regulation restricting foreign ownership or requiring reversion or divestiture; • laws or regulations that tax or otherwise restrict repatriation of earnings or other funds or otherwise limit distributions of capital; • changes in a specific country’s or region’s political or economic conditions, including inflation or currency devaluation; • changes to zoning regulations or construction laws, which could be applied retroactively to our existing communications sites; • actions restricting or revoking our tenants’ spectrum licenses or suspending or terminating business under prior licenses; • failure to comply with anti-bribery laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar local anti-bribery laws, or the Office of Foreign Assets Control requirements; • failure to comply with data privacy laws and other protections of employee health and personal information; • material site issues related to security, fuel availability and reliability of electrical grids; • significant increases in, or implementation of new, license surcharges on our revenue; • loss of key personnel, including expatriates, in markets where talent is difficult or expensive to acquire; and • price-setting or other similar laws or regulations for the sharing of passive infrastructure. 9 Table of Contents We also face risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, including those arising from our operations, investments and financing transactions related to our international business. Volatility in foreign currency exchange rates can also affect our ability to plan, forecast and budget for our international operations and expansion efforts. Our revenues earned from our international operations are primarily denominated in their respective local currencies. We have not historically engaged in significant currency hedging activities relating to our non-U.S. Dollar operations, and a weakening of these foreign currencies against the U.S. Dollar would negatively impact our reported revenues, operating profits and income. In addition, as we continue to invest in joint venture opportunities internationally, our partners may have business or economic goals that are inconsistent or conflict with ours, be in positions to take action contrary to our interests, policies or objectives, have competing interests in our, or other, markets that could create conflict of interest issues, withhold consents contrary to our requests or become unable or unwilling to fulfill their commitments, any of which could expose us to additional liabilities or costs, including requiring us to assume and fulfill the obligations of that joint venture or to execute buyouts of their interests. A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of tenants, and we are sensitive to changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our tenants. A substantial portion of our total operating revenues is derived from a small number of tenants. If any of these tenants is unwilling or unable to perform its obligations under their agreements with us, our revenues, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected. In the ordinary course of our business, we do occasionally experience disputes with our tenants, generally regarding the interpretation of terms in our leases. Historically, we have resolved these disputes in a manner that did not have a material adverse effect on us or our tenant relationships. However, it is possible that such disputes could lead to a termination of our leases with tenants, a material modification of the terms of those leases or a deterioration in our relationships with those tenants that leads to a failure to obtain new business from them, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. If we are forced to resolve any of these disputes through litigation, our relationship with the applicable tenant could be terminated or damaged, which could lead to decreased revenue or increased costs, resulting in a corresponding adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Due to the long-term nature of our tenant leases, we depend on the continued financial strength of our tenants. Many wireless service providers operate with substantial levels of debt. Sometimes our tenants, or their parent companies, face financial difficulty, file for bankruptcy or terminate operations. In our international operations, many of our tenants are subsidiaries of global telecommunications companies. These subsidiaries may not have the explicit or implied financial support of their parent entities. In addition, many of our tenants and potential tenants rely on capital raising activities to fund their operations and capital expenditures, which may be more difficult or expensive in the event of downturns in the economy or disruptions in the financial and credit markets. If our tenants or potential tenants are unable to raise adequate capital to fund their business plans or face capital constraints, they may reduce their spending, which could materially and adversely affect demand for our communications sites and our services business. If, as a result of a prolonged economic downturn or otherwise, one or more of our tenants experiences financial difficulties or files for bankruptcy, it could result in uncollectible accounts receivable and an impairment of our deferred rent asset, tower asset, network location intangible asset, tenant-related intangible asset or goodwill. The loss of significant tenants, or the loss of all or a portion of our anticipated lease revenues from certain tenants, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Our expansion initiatives involve a number of risks and uncertainties, including those related to integrating acquired or leased assets, that could adversely affect our operating results, disrupt our operations or expose us to additional risk. As we continue to acquire communications sites in our existing markets and expand into new markets, we are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including not meeting our return on investment criteria and financial objectives, increased costs, assumed liabilities and the diversion of managerial attention due to acquisitions. Achieving the benefits of acquisitions depends in part on timely and efficient integration of operations, telecommunications infrastructure assets and personnel. Integration may be difficult and unpredictable for many reasons, including, among other things, portfolios without requisite permits, differing systems, cultural differences, and conflicting policies, procedures and operations. Significant acquisition-related integration costs, including certain nonrecurring charges such as costs associated with onboarding employees, acquiring permits and visiting, inspecting, engineering and upgrading tower sites, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in the period in which such charges are recorded or our cash flow in the period in which any related costs are actually paid. Some of our acquired tower portfolios have included sites that do not meet our structural specifications, including sites that may be overburdened. In these cases, in addition to additional capital expenditures, general liability risks associated with such towers will exist until such time as those towers are upgraded or otherwise remedied. In addition, integration may 10 Table of Contents significantly burden management and internal resources, including through the potential loss or unavailability of key personnel. If we fail to successfully integrate the assets we acquire or fail to utilize such assets to their full capacity, we may not realize the benefits we expect from our acquired portfolios, and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. Our international expansion initiatives are subject to additional risks such as those described above. As a result of acquisitions, we have a substantial amount of intangible assets and goodwill. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”), we are required to assess our goodwill and other intangible assets annually or more frequently in the event of circumstances indicating potential impairment to determine if they are impaired. If, as a result of the factors noted above, the testing performed indicates that an asset may not be recoverable, we are required to record a non-cash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets and the implied fair value of the goodwill or the estimated fair value of other intangible assets in the period the determination is made. Our expansion initiatives may not be successful or we may be required to record impairment charges for our goodwill or for other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. New technologies or changes in our or a tenant’s business model could make our tower leasing business less desirable and result in decreasing revenues and operating results. The development and implementation of new technologies designed to enhance the efficiency of wireless networks or changes in a tenant’s business model could reduce the need for tower-based wireless services, decrease demand for tower space or reduce previously obtainable lease rates. In addition, tenants may allocate less of their budgets to leasing space on our towers, as the industry is trending towards deploying increased capital to the development and implementation of new technologies. Examples of these technologies include spectrally efficient technologies, which could relieve a portion of our tenants’ network capacity needs and, as a result, could reduce the demand for tower-based antenna space. Additionally, certain small cell complementary network technologies or satellite services could shift a portion of our tenants’ network investments away from the traditional tower-based networks, which may reduce the need for carriers to add more equipment at certain communications sites. Moreover, the emergence of alternative technologies could reduce the need for tower-based broadcast services transmission and reception. Further, a tenant may decide to cease outsourcing tower infrastructure or otherwise change its business model, which would result in a decrease in our revenue and operating results. Our failure to innovate in response to the development and implementation of these or other new technologies or changes in a tenant’s business model could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Conversely, we may invest significant capital in technologies, innovation projects or new additions to our core business that may not provide expected returns or profitability, which could divert management attention and have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Competition for assets could adversely affect our ability to achieve our return on investment criteria. We may experience increased competition for the acquisition of assets or contracts to build new communications sites for tenants, which could make the acquisition of high quality assets significantly more costly or prohibitive or cause us to lose contracts to build new sites. Some of our competitors are larger and may have greater financial resources than we do, while other competitors may apply less stringent investment criteria than we do. In addition, we may not anticipate increased competition entering a particular market or competing for the same assets. Higher prices for assets or the failure to add new assets to our portfolio could make it more difficult to achieve our anticipated returns on investment or future growth, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. Our leverage and debt service obligations may materially and adversely affect our ability to raise additional financing to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives and to satisfy our distribution requirements. Our leverage and debt service obligations could have significant negative consequences to our business, results of operations or financial condition, including: • requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our debt, thereby reducing the amount of our cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures and REIT distributions; • impairing our ability to meet one or more of the financial ratio covenants contained in our debt agreements or to generate cash sufficient to pay interest or principal due under those agreements, which could result in an acceleration of some or all of our outstanding debt and the loss of the towers securing such debt if a default remains uncured; 11 Table of Contents • limiting our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing, thereby placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitors and competitors that may have better access to capital resources, including with respect to acquiring assets; and • limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the markets in which we compete. We may need to raise additional capital through debt financing activities, asset sales or equity issuances, even if the then-prevailing market conditions are not favorable, to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, required purchases of our joint venture partners’ interests and to satisfy our distribution requirements and debt service obligations. An increase in our total leverage could lead to a downgrade of our credit rating below investment grade, which could negatively impact our ability to access credit markets or preclude us from obtaining funds on investment grade terms, rates and conditions or subject us to additional loan covenants. In addition, potential changes to, or the elimination of, the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), may adversely affect interest expense related to borrowings under our credit facilities, certain other debt service obligations and interest rate swaps, which could potentially negatively impact our financial condition. Further, certain of our current debt instruments limit the amount of indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may incur. Additional financing, therefore, may be unavailable, more expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness. If we fail to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT, we will be subject to tax at corporate income tax rates, which may substantially reduce funds otherwise available, and even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may face tax liabilities that impact earnings and available cash flow. Commencing with the taxable year beginning January 1, 2012, we have operated as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. Qualification for taxation as a REIT requires the application of certain highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), which provisions may change from time to time, to our operations as well as various factual determinations concerning matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. Further, tax legislation may adversely affect our ability to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT or the benefits or desirability of remaining so qualified. There are few judicial or administrative interpretations of the relevant provisions of the Code. If, in any taxable year, we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT and are not entitled to relief under the Code: • we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income; • we will be required to pay federal and state income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates; and • we will be disqualified from REIT tax treatment for the four taxable years immediately following the year during which we were so disqualified. We are subject to certain federal, state, local and foreign taxes on our income and assets, including taxes on any undistributed income and state, local or foreign income, franchise, property and transfer taxes. While state and local income tax regimes often parallel the U.S. federal income tax regime for REITs, many of these jurisdictions do not completely follow U.S. federal rules and some may not follow them at all. For example, some state and local jurisdictions currently or in the future may limit or eliminate a REIT’s deduction for dividends paid, which could increase our income tax expense. We are also subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and state, local and foreign tax authorities. The results of an audit and examination of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures may have an adverse effect on our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability. Our domestic TRS assets and operations are subject, as applicable, to federal and state corporation income taxes. Our foreign operations, whether in the REIT or TRSs, are subject to foreign taxes in jurisdictions in which those assets and operations are located. Any corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes. If we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may need to borrow additional funds or liquidate some investments to pay any additional tax liability. Accordingly, funds available for investment, operations and distribution would be reduced. Furthermore, we have owned and may from time to time own direct and indirect ownership interests in subsidiary REITs. When we own interests in a subsidiary REIT, we must demonstrate that such subsidiary REIT complies with the same REIT requirements that we must satisfy, together with all other rules applicable to REITs. If the subsidiary REIT is determined to have failed to qualify for taxation as a REIT and certain relief provisions do not apply, then the subsidiary REIT would be 12 Table of Contents subject to federal income tax, which tax we would economically bear along with applicable penalties and interest. In addition, our ownership of shares in such subsidiary REIT would fail to be a qualifying asset for purposes of the asset tests applicable to REITs and any dividend income or gains derived by us from such subsidiary REIT may cease to be treated as income that qualifies for purposes of the 75% gross income test. These consequences could have a material adverse effect on our ability to comply with the REIT income and asset tests, and thus our ability to qualify for taxation as a REIT. Complying with REIT requirements may limit our flexibility or cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities. Our use of TRSs enables us to engage in non-REIT qualifying business activities. Under the Code, no more than 20% of the value of the assets of a REIT may be represented by securities of one or more TRSs and other non-qualifying assets. This limitation may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments, including the purchase of non-qualifying assets, the expansion of non-real estate activities and investments in the businesses to be conducted by our TRSs, and to that extent limit our opportunities and our flexibility to change our business strategy. Specifically, this limitation may affect our ability to make additional investments in our managed networks business or services segment as currently structured and operated, in other non-REIT qualifying operations or assets, or in international operations conducted through TRSs that we do not elect to bring into the REIT structure. Further, acquisition opportunities in the United States and international markets may be adversely affected if we need or require the target company to comply with certain REIT requirements prior to closing. Further, as a REIT, we must distribute to our stockholders an amount equal to at least 90% of the REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain). To meet our annual distribution requirements, we may be required to distribute amounts that may otherwise be used for our operations, including amounts that may otherwise be invested in future acquisitions, capital expenditures or repayment of debt. As no more than 25% of our gross income may consist of dividend income from our TRSs and other non-qualifying types of income, our ability to receive distributions from our TRSs may be limited, which may impact our ability to fund distributions to our stockholders or to use income of our TRSs to fund other investments. In addition, the majority of our income and cash flows from our TRSs are generated from our international operations. In many cases, there are local withholding taxes and currency controls that may impact our ability or willingness to repatriate funds to the United States to help satisfy REIT distribution requirements. Restrictive covenants in the agreements related to our securitization transactions, our credit facilities and our debt securities could materially and adversely affect our business by limiting flexibility, and we may be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock, which may jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a REIT. The agreements related to our securitization transactions include operating covenants and other restrictions customary for loans subject to rated securitizations. Among other things, the borrowers under the agreements are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets. A failure to comply with the covenants in the agreements could prevent the borrowers from taking certain actions with respect to the secured assets and could prevent the borrowers from distributing any excess cash from the operation of such assets to us. If the borrowers were to default on any of the loans, the servicer on such loan could seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of the secured assets, in which case we could lose such assets and the cash flow associated with such assets. We enter into hedges for certain debt instruments. These hedges may have an adverse impact on our results to the extent that the counterparties do not perform as expected at the inception of each hedge. The agreements for our credit facilities also contain restrictive covenants and leverage and other financial maintenance tests that could limit our ability to take various actions, including incurring additional debt, guaranteeing indebtedness or making distributions to stockholders, including our required REIT distributions, and engaging in various types of transactions, including mergers, acquisitions and sales of assets. Additionally, our debt agreements restrict our and our subsidiaries’ ability to incur liens securing our or their indebtedness. These covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, new tower development, mergers and acquisitions or other opportunities. Further, reporting and information covenants in our credit agreements and indentures require that we provide financial and operating information within certain time periods. If we are unable to provide the required information on a timely basis, we would be in breach of these covenants. For more information regarding the covenants and requirements discussed above, please see Item 7 of this Annual Report under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Factors Affecting Sources of Liquidity” and note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. 13 Table of Contents Our towers, fiber networks, data centers or computer systems may be affected by natural disasters, security breaches and other unforeseen events for which our insurance may not provide adequate coverage. Our towers and fiber networks are subject to risks associated with natural disasters, including those that may be related to climate change, such as hurricanes, ice and wind storms, tornadoes, floods, earthquakes and wildfires, as well as other unforeseen events, such as acts of terrorism. Any damage or destruction to, or inability to access, our towers or data centers may impact our ability to provide services to our tenants and lead to tenant loss, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. As part of our normal business activities, we rely on information technology and other computer resources to carry out important operational, reporting and compliance activities and to maintain our business records. Our computer systems, network operation centers or power systems, or those of our cloud or Internet-based providers, could fail on their own accord and are subject to interruption or damage from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches (including through cyber attack and data theft), usage errors, catastrophic events such as natural disasters and other events beyond our control. Although we and our vendors have disaster recovery programs and security measures in place, if our computer systems and our backup systems are compromised, degraded, damaged, breached or otherwise cease to function properly, we could suffer interruptions in our operations, including our ability to correctly record, process and report financial information, our tenants’ network availability may be impacted or we could unintentionally allow misappropriation of proprietary or confidential information (including information about our tenants or landlords), which could result in a loss of revenue, damage our reputation, litigation, penalties under existing or future data privacy laws and require us to incur significant costs to remediate or otherwise resolve these issues. In addition, our recent acquisitions, including acquisitions of fiber businesses, may increase our exposure to the risks described above and have material and adverse effects on our business. While we maintain insurance coverage for natural disasters, business interruption and cybersecurity, we may not have adequate insurance to cover the associated costs of repair or reconstruction of sites or fiber for a major future event, lost revenue, including from new tenants that could have been added to our towers or fiber networks but for the event, or other costs to remediate the impact of a significant event. Further, we may be liable for damage caused by towers that collapse for any number of reasons including structural deficiencies, which could harm our reputation and require us to incur costs for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage. Our costs could increase and our revenues could decrease due to perceived health risks from radio emissions, especially if these perceived risks are substantiated. Public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and other wireless communications technology could slow the growth of wireless companies, which could in turn slow our growth. In particular, negative public perception of, and regulations regarding, these perceived health risks could undermine the market acceptance of wireless communications services and increase opposition to the development and expansion of tower sites. If a scientific study, court decision or government agency ruling resulted in a finding that radio frequency emissions pose health risks to consumers, it could negatively impact our tenants and the market for wireless services, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. We do not maintain any significant insurance with respect to these matters. We could have liability under environmental and occupational safety and health laws. Our operations are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations, including those relating to the management, use, storage, disposal, emission and remediation of, and exposure to, hazardous and non-hazardous substances, materials and wastes. As the owner, lessee or operator of real property and facilities, including generators, we may be liable for substantial costs of investigation, removal or remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous materials, and for damages and costs relating to off-site migration of hazardous materials, without regard to whether we, as the owner, lessee or operator, knew of, or were responsible for, the contamination. We may also be liable for certain costs of remediating contamination at third-party sites to which we sent waste for disposal, even if the original disposal may have complied with all legal requirements at the time. Many of these laws and regulations contain information reporting and record keeping requirements. We may not be at all times in compliance with all environmental requirements. We may be subject to potentially significant fines or penalties if we fail to comply with any of these requirements. The requirements of the environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and could become more stringent in the future. In certain jurisdictions these laws and regulations could be applied retroactively, or be broadened to cover situations or persons not currently considered. It is possible that these requirements will change or that liabilities will arise in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. While we maintain environmental and workers’ compensation insurance, we may not have adequate insurance to cover all costs, fines or penalties. 14 Table of Contents If we are unable to protect our rights to the land under our towers, it could adversely affect our business and operating results. Our real property interests relating to our towers consist primarily of leasehold and sub-leasehold interests, fee interests, easements, licenses and rights-of-way. A loss of these interests at a particular tower site may interfere with our ability to operate that tower site and generate revenues. For various reasons, we may not always have the ability to access, analyze and verify all information regarding titles and other issues prior to completing an acquisition of communications sites, which can affect our rights to access and operate a site. From time to time we also experience disputes with landowners regarding the terms of easements or ground agreements for land under towers, which can affect our ability to access and operate tower sites. Further, for various reasons, landowners may not want to renew their ground agreements with us, they may lose their rights to the land, or they may transfer their land interests to third parties, including ground lease aggregators, which could affect our ability to renew ground agreements on commercially viable terms. A significant number of the communications sites in our portfolio are located on land we lease pursuant to long-term operating leases. Further, for various reasons, title to property interests in some of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate may not be as certain as title to our property interests in the United States. Our inability to protect our rights to the land under our towers may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. If we are unable or choose not to exercise our rights to purchase towers that are subject to lease and sublease agreements at the end of the applicable period, our cash flows derived from those towers will be eliminated. Our communications real estate portfolio includes towers that we operate pursuant to lease and sublease agreements that include a purchase option at the end of the lease period. We may not have the required available capital to exercise our right to purchase the towers at the end of the applicable period, or we may choose, for business or other reasons, not to do so. If we do not exercise these purchase rights, and are unable to extend the lease or sublease or otherwise acquire an interest that would allow us to continue to operate these towers after the applicable period, we will lose the cash flows derived from the towers. If we decide to exercise these purchase rights, the benefits of acquiring a significant number of towers may not exceed the associated acquisition, compliance and integration costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

In addition, we lease approximately 31,200 square feet of office space in Cary, NC for our U.S. Tower Division, Managed Networks and Innovation function. (2) We lease two office spaces that together occupy an aggregate of approximately 12,500 square feet. (3) We lease two office spaces that together occupy an aggregate of approximately 27,100 square feet. (4) We lease two office spaces that together occupy an aggregate of approximately 13,800 square feet. In addition to the principal offices set forth above, we maintain offices in the geographic areas we serve through which we operate our tower leasing and services businesses. We believe that our owned and leased facilities are suitable and adequate to meet our anticipated needs. As of December 31, 2018 , we owned and operated a portfolio of 170,686 communications sites, including 1,701 DAS networks. See the table in Item 7 of this Annual Report, under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial 16 Table of Contents Condition and Results of Operations—Executive Overview” for more detailed information on the geographic locations of our communications sites. In addition, we own property interests that we lease to communications service providers and third-party tower operators in the United States, which are included in our U.S. property segment. Our interests in our communications sites consist of a variety of ownership interests, including leases created by long-term ground lease agreements, easements, licenses or rights-of-way granted by government entities. A typical tower site consists of a compound enclosing the tower site, a tower structure and one or more equipment shelters that house a variety of transmitting, receiving and switching equipment. In addition, many of our international sites typically include backup or auxiliary power generators and batteries. The principal types of our towers are guyed, self-supporting lattice and monopole, and rooftops in our international markets. • A guyed tower includes a series of cables attaching separate levels of the tower to anchor foundations in the ground and can reach heights of up to 2,000 feet. A guyed tower site for a typical broadcast tower can consist of a tract of land of up to 20 acres. • A self-supporting lattice tower typically tapers from the bottom up and usually has three or four legs. A lattice tower can reach heights of up to 1,000 feet. Depending on the height of the tower, a lattice tower site for a typical wireless communications tower can consist of a tract of land of 10,000 square feet for a rural site or fewer than 2,500 square feet for a metropolitan site. • A monopole tower is a tubular structure that is used primarily to address space constraints or aesthetic concerns. Monopoles typically have heights ranging from 50 to 200 feet. A monopole tower site used in metropolitan areas for a typical wireless communications tower can consist of a tract of land of fewer than 2,500 square feet. • Rooftop towers are primarily used in metropolitan areas in our Asia, EMEA and Latin America markets, where locations for traditional tower structures are unavailable. Rooftop towers typically have heights ranging from 10 to 100 feet. U.S. Property Segment Encumbered Sites . As of December 31, 2018 , the loan underlying the securitization transactions completed in March 2013 and March 2018 (the “2013 Securitization” and the “2018 Securitization”, respectively, and together, the “Trust Securitizations”) is secured by mortgages, deeds of trust and deeds to secure the loan on substantially all of the 5,116 broadcast and wireless communications towers and related assets owned by the borrowers (the “Trust Sites”) and the secured revenue notes issued in a private transaction completed in May 2015 (the “2015 Securitization”) are secured by mortgages, deeds of trust and deeds to secure debt on substantially all of the 3,556 communications sites owned by subsidiaries of the issuer (the “2015 Secured Sites”). Asia Property Segment Encumbered Sites. Certain of the outstanding indebtedness is secured by ATC TIPL’s short-term and long-term assets, including an aggregate of 75,872 sites. EMEA Property Segment Encumbered Sites. Our outstanding indebtedness in South Africa is secured by an aggregate of 1,899 towers. Latin America Property Segment Encumbered Sites . Our outstanding indebtedness in Brazil is secured by an aggregate of 760 towers and outstanding indebtedness in Colombia is secured by an aggregate of 3,563 towers. Ground Leases. Of the 168,985 towers in our portfolio as of December 31, 2018 , 90% were located on land we lease. Typically, we seek to enter long-term ground leases, which have initial terms of approximately five to ten years with one or more automatic or exercisable renewal periods. As a result, 46% of the ground leases for our sites have a final expiration date of 2028 and beyond. Tenants . Our tenants are primarily wireless service providers, broadcasters and other companies in a variety of industries. For the year ended December 31, 2018 , our top four tenants by total revenue were AT&T ( 19% ), Verizon Wireless ( 15% ), T-Mobile ( 9% ) and Sprint ( 8% ). Across most of our markets, our tenant leases generally have an initial non-cancellable term of at least ten years, with multiple renewal terms. As a result, approximately 49% of our current tenant leases have a renewal date of 2024 or beyond. 17 Table of Contents ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS We periodically become involved in various claims and lawsuits that are incidental to our business. In the opinion of management, after consultation with counsel, there are no matters currently pending that would, in the event of an adverse outcome, have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES N/A. 18 Table of Contents PART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Our common stock is listed on the NYSE under the ticker symbol AMT. As of February 20, 2019 , we had 441,134,906 outstanding shares of common stock and 145 registered holders. Dividends As a REIT, we must annually distribute to our stockholders an amount equal to at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain). Generally, we have distributed and expect to continue to distribute all or substantially all of our REIT taxable income after taking into consideration our utilization of net operating losses ( “ NOLs ” ). The amount, timing and frequency of future distributions will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon various factors, a number of which may be beyond our control, including our financial condition and operating cash flows, the amount required to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT and reduce any income and excise taxes that we otherwise would be required to pay, limitations on distributions in our existing and future debt and preferred equity instruments, our ability to utilize NOLs to offset our distribution requirements, limitations on our ability to fund distributions using cash generated through our TRSs and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant.

In addition to the 2011 Buyback, in December 2017, our Board of Directors approved an additional stock repurchase program, pursuant to which we are authorized to repurchase up to $2.0 billion of our common stock (the “2017 Buyback”, and together with the 2011 Buyback the “Buyback Programs”). During the three months ended December 31, 2018 , we repurchased a total of 301,946 shares of our common stock for an aggregate of $43.6 million, including commissions and fees, pursuant to the 2011 Buyback. We had no repurchases under the 2017 Buyback. The table below sets forth details of our repurchases under the 2011 Buyback during the three months ended December 31, 2018 .

Under this program, our management is authorized to purchase shares from time to time through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions at prevailing prices as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements, and subject to market conditions and other factors. To facilitate repurchases, we make purchases pursuant to trading plans under Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act, which allows us to repurchase shares during periods when we otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of self-imposed trading blackout periods. This program may be discontinued at any time. (2) Average price paid per share is a weighted average calculation using the aggregate price, excluding commissions and fees. We have repurchased a total of 14.0 million shares of our common stock under the 2011 Buyback for an aggregate of $1.4 billion , including commissions and fees. We expect to continue to manage the pacing of the remaining $2.1 billion under the Buyback Programs in response to general market conditions and other relevant factors. We expect to fund any further repurchases of our common stock through a combination of cash on hand, cash generated by operations and borrowings under our credit facilities. Purchases under the Buyback Programs are subject to our having available cash to fund repurchases. ITEM 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA The selected financial data should be read in conjunction with our “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. Year-over-year comparisons are significantly affected by our acquisitions, dispositions and construction of towers. Our transaction with Verizon Communications Inc. (“Verizon” and the transaction, the “Verizon Transaction”) and the acquisition of a controlling ownership interest in Viom Networks Limited (“Viom” and the acquisition, the “Viom Acquisition”), which closed in March 2015 and April 2016, respectively, significantly impact the comparability of reported results between periods. Our principal 2018 acquisitions are described in note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. 21 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 2015 2014 (In millions, except share and per share data) Statements of Operations Data: Revenues: Property $ 7,314.7 $ 6,565.9 $ 5,713.1 $ 4,680.4 $ 4,006.9 Services 125.4 98.0 72.6 91.1 93.1 Total operating revenues 7,440.1 6,663.9 5,785.7 4,771.5 4,100.0 Operating expenses: Cost of operations (exclusive of items shown separately below) Property 2,128.7 2,022.0 1,762.7 1,275.4 1,056.2 Services 49.1 34.6 27.7 33.4 38.1 Depreciation, amortization and accretion 2,110.8 1,715.9 1,525.6 1,285.3 1,003.8 Selling, general, administrative and development expense 733.2 637.0 543.4 497.8 446.5 Other operating expenses 513.3 256.0 73.3 66.8 68.5 Total operating expenses 5,535.1 4,665.5 3,932.7 3,158.7 2,613.1 Operating income 1,905.0 1,998.4 1,853.0 1,612.8 1,486.9 Interest (expense) income, TV Azteca, net (0.1 ) 10.8 10.9 11.2 10.5 Interest income 54.7 35.4 25.6 16.5 14.0 Interest expense (825.5 ) (749.6 ) (717.1 ) (595.9 ) (580.2 ) (Loss) gain on retirement of long-term obligations (3.3 ) (70.2 ) 1.2 (79.6 ) (3.5 ) Other income (expense) (1) 23.8 31.3 (47.7 ) (135.0 ) (62.0 ) Income from continuing operations before income taxes 1,154.6 1,256.1 1,125.9 830.0 865.7 Income tax benefit (provision) 110.1 (30.7 ) (155.5 ) (158.0 ) (62.5 ) Net income 1,264.7 1,225.4 970.4 672.0 803.2 Net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests (28.3 ) 13.5 (14.0 ) 13.1 21.7 Net income attributable to American Tower Corporation stockholders 1,236.4 1,238.9 956.4 685.1 824.9 Dividends on preferred stock (9.4 ) (87.4 ) (107.1 ) (90.2 ) (23.9 ) Net income attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders $ 1,227.0 $ 1,151.5 $ 849.3 $ 594.9 $ 801.0 Net income per common share amounts: Basic net income attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders $ 2.79 $ 2.69 $ 2.00 $ 1.42 $ 2.02 Diluted net income attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders $ 2.77 $ 2.67 $ 1.98 $ 1.41 $ 2.00 Weighted average common shares outstanding (in thousands): Basic 439,606 428,181 425,143 418,907 395,958 Diluted 442,960 431,688 429,283 423,015 400,086 Distribution declared per common share $ 3.15 $ 2.62 $ 2.17 $ 1.81 $ 1.40 Distribution declared per preferred share, Series A $ — $ 2.63 $ 5.25 $ 3.94 $ 3.98 Distribution declared per preferred share, Series B $ 13.75 $ 55.00 $ 55.00 $ 38.65 $ — 22 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2018 2017 2016 2015 2014 (2) (In millions) Balance Sheet Data: Cash and cash equivalents (including restricted cash) (3) $ 1,304.9 $ 954.9 $ 936.5 $ 462.9 $ 473.7 Property and equipment, net 11,247.1 11,101.0 10,517.3 9,866.4 7,590.1 Total assets 33,010.4 33,214.3 30,879.2 26,904.3 21,263.6 Long-term obligations, including current portion 21,159.9 20,205.1 18,533.5 17,119.0 14,540.3 Redeemable noncontrolling interest 1,004.8 1,126.2 1,091.3 — — Total American Tower Corporation equity 5,336.1 6,241.5 6,763.9 6,651.7 3,953.6 _______________ (1) For the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 , 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , amount includes foreign currency (losses) gains of ($4.5) million , $26.4 million, ($48.9) million, ($134.7) million and ($63.2) million, respectively.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations that follow are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences could be material to the financial statements. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report and the accompanying notes, and the information set forth under the caption “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” below. We report our results in five segments: U.S. property, Asia property, EMEA property, Latin America property and services. In evaluating financial performance in each business segment, management uses, among other factors, segment gross margin and segment operating profit (see note 20 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report). Executive Overview We are one of the largest global REITs and a leading independent owner, operator and developer of multitenant communications real estate. Our primary business is the leasing of space on communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, wireless data providers, government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries. In addition to the communications sites in our portfolio, we manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements. We also hold other telecommunications infrastructure, fiber and property interests that we lease primarily to communications service providers and third-party tower operators. We refer to this business as our property operations, which accounted for 98% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 and includes our U.S. property segment, Asia property segment, EMEA property segment and Latin America property segment. We also offer tower-related services in the United States, including site acquisition, zoning and permitting and structural analysis, which primarily support our site leasing business, including the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites. 23 Table of Contents The following table details the number of communications sites, excluding managed sites, that we owned or operated as of December 31, 2018 : Number of Owned Towers Number of Operated Towers (1) Number of Owned DAS Sites Domestic: United States 24,454 15,905 398 Asia: India 74,804 — 1,068 EMEA: France 2,186 309 9 Germany 2,208 — — Ghana 2,279 — 24 Kenya 715 Nigeria 4,760 — — South Africa (2) 2,652 — — Uganda 1,523 — — EMEA total 16,323 309 33 Latin America: Argentina (3) 36 — 4 Brazil (3) 16,632 2,257 91 Chile 1,298 — 18 Colombia 4,943 — 2 Costa Rica 553 — 2 Mexico (4) 9,047 186 85 Paraguay 1,276 — — Peru 690 272 — Latin America total 34,475 2,715 202 _______________ (1) Approximately 98% of the operated towers are held pursuant to long-term capital leases, including those subject to purchase options. (2) In South Africa, we also own fiber. (3) In Argentina and Brazil, we also own or operate urban telecommunications assets, fiber and the rights to utilize certain existing utility infrastructure for future telecommunications equipment installation. (4) In Mexico, we also own or operate urban telecommunications assets, including fiber, concrete poles and other infrastructure. In most of our markets, our tenant leases with wireless carriers generally have an initial non-cancellable term of at least ten years, with multiple renewal terms. Accordingly, the vast majority of the revenue generated by our property operations during the year ended December 31, 2018 was recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. Based upon foreign currency exchange rates and the tenant leases in place as of December 31, 2018 , we expect to generate nearly $35 billion of non-cancellable tenant lease revenue over future periods, before the impact of straight-line lease accounting. Most of our tenant leases have provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease, typically based on an annual fixed escalation (averaging approximately 3% in the United States) or an inflationary index in our international markets, or a combination of both. In addition, certain of our tenant leases provide for additional revenue primarily to cover costs, such as ground rent or power and fuel costs. The revenues generated by our property operations may be affected by cancellations of existing tenant leases. As discussed above, most of our tenant leases with wireless carriers and broadcasters are multiyear contracts, which typically are non-cancellable; however, in some instances, a lease may be cancelled upon the payment of a termination fee. Revenue lost from either cancellations or the non-renewal of leases or rent renegotiations, which we refer to as churn, historically has not had a material adverse effect on the revenues generated by our consolidated property operations. This was again the case during the year ended December 31, 2018 , in which loss of tenant billings from tenant lease cancellations, non-renewal or renegotiations represented approximately 4% of our tenant billings. 24 Table of Contents In 2018, we experienced an increase in revenue lost from cancellations or non-renewals primarily due to carrier consolidation-driven churn in India, which we expect will continue to result in a higher impact on our revenues, including tenant billings, as compared to the historical average, in 2019. We also expect this churn will compress our gross margin and operating profit in 2019, particularly in our Asia property segment, although we expect this to be partially offset by lower expenses due to reduced tenancy on existing sites or the decommissioning of sites. In addition, we expect to periodically evaluate the carrying value of our Indian assets, which may result in the realization of additional impairment expense or other similar charges. For more information, please see the information under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.” In October 2018, we entered into agreements with one of our tenants in India, Tata Teleservices and related entities (collectively, “Tata”), for a settlement and release of certain contractual lease obligations of Tata. For the year ended December 31, 2018, carrier consolidation-driven churn in India, including churn associated with our settlement with Tata, negatively impacted our consolidated property revenue by $189.1 million, including approximately $61.0 million in pass-through revenue, and negatively impacted our gross margin and operating profit by $119.8 million. The effects of carrier consolidation-driven churn described above were offset by the impact of the settlement with Tata, which resulted in a net positive impact to property revenue of $333.7 million as a result of the $345.5 million cash payment, partially offset by the impact of straight-line accounting and other amounts directly related to the settlement. The settlement also resulted in a net positive impact to operating profit of $326.9 million. On a net basis, carrier consolidation-driven churn and our settlement with Tata positively impacted our full year 2018 consolidated property revenue by $144.6 million and our full year 2018 operating profit by $207.1 million. In 2019, we expect carrier consolidation-driven churn in India, excluding the impact of the nonrecurrence of one-time items related to the settlement with Tata in 2018, to negatively impact our consolidated property revenue by approximately $191.2 million, including approximately $22.3 million in pass-through revenue, and our operating profit by approximately $148.0 million. We also recorded impairment charges of $164.2 million as a result of the settlement with Tata in October 2018 and $147.4 million as a result of one of our tenants in India, Aircel Ltd.’s (“Aircel”), filing for bankruptcy protection in February 2018. Property Operations Revenue Growth . Due to our diversified communications site portfolio, our tenant lease rates vary considerably depending upon numerous factors, including, but not limited to, amount, type and position of tenant equipment on the tower, remaining tower capacity and tower location. We measure the remaining tower capacity by assessing several factors, including tower height, tower type, environmental conditions, existing equipment on the tower and zoning and permitting regulations in effect in the jurisdiction where the tower is located. In many instances, tower capacity can be increased with relatively modest tower augmentation capital expenditures. The primary factors affecting the revenue growth of our property segments are: • Growth in tenant billings, including: • New revenue attributable to leases in place on day one on sites acquired or constructed since the beginning of the prior-year period; • New revenue attributable to leasing additional space on our sites (“colocations”) and lease amendments; and • Contractual rent escalations on existing tenant leases, net of churn. • Revenue growth from other items, including additional tenant payments primarily to cover costs, such as ground rent or power and fuel costs included in certain tenant leases (“pass-through”), straight-line revenue and decommissioning. We continue to believe that our site leasing revenue is likely to increase due to the growing use of wireless services globally and our ability to meet the corresponding incremental demand for our communications real estate. By adding new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our sites, we are able to increase these sites’ utilization and profitability. We believe the majority of our site leasing activity will continue to come from wireless service providers, with tenants in a number of other industries contributing incremental leasing demand. Our site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with new business opportunities, which have historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth as wireless carriers seek to increase the coverage and capacity of their existing networks, while also deploying next generation wireless technologies. In addition, we intend to continue to supplement our organic growth by selectively developing or acquiring new sites in our existing and new markets where we can achieve our risk-adjusted return on investment objectives. Property Operations Organic Revenue Growth . Consistent with our strategy to increase the utilization and return on investment from our sites, our objective is to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants through colocation and lease amendments. Our ability to lease additional space on our sites is primarily a function of the rate at which wireless carriers 25 Table of Contents and other tenants deploy capital to improve and expand their wireless networks. This rate, in turn, is influenced by the growth of wireless services, the penetration of advanced wireless devices, the level of emphasis on network quality and capacity in carrier competition, the financial performance of our tenants and their access to capital and general economic conditions. According to industry data, recent aggregate annual wireless capital spending in the United States has averaged approximately $30 billion, resulting in consistent demand for our sites. Based on industry research and projections, we expect that a number of key industry trends will result in incremental revenue opportunities for us: • In less advanced wireless markets where initial voice and data networks are still being deployed, we expect these deployments to drive demand for our tower space as carriers seek to expand their footprints and increase the scope and density of their networks. We have established operations in many of these markets at the early stages of wireless development, which we believe will enable us to meaningfully participate in these deployments over the long term. • Subscribers’ use of mobile data continues to grow rapidly given increasing smartphone and other advanced device penetration, the proliferation of bandwidth-intensive applications on these devices and the continuing evolution of the mobile ecosystem. We believe carriers will be compelled to deploy additional equipment on existing networks while also rolling out more advanced wireless networks to address coverage and capacity needs resulting from this increasing mobile data usage. • The deployment of advanced mobile technology, such as 4G and 5G, across existing wireless networks will provide higher speed data services and further enable fixed broadband substitution. As a result, we expect that our tenants will continue deploying additional equipment across their existing networks. • Wireless service providers compete based on the quality of their existing networks, which is driven by capacity and coverage. To maintain or improve their network performance as overall network usage increases, our tenants continue deploying additional equipment across their existing sites while also adding new cell sites. We anticipate increasing network densification over the next several years, as existing network infrastructure is anticipated to be insufficient to account for rapidly increasing levels of wireless data usage. • Wireless service providers continue to acquire additional spectrum, and as a result are expected to add additional sites and equipment to their networks as they seek to optimize their network configuration and utilize additional spectrum. • Next generation technologies requiring wireless connectivity have the potential to provide incremental revenue opportunities for us. These technologies may include autonomous vehicle networks and a number of other internet-of-things, or IoT, applications, as well as other potential use cases for wireless services. These technologies may create new and complementary use cases for our communications real estate over time, although these use cases are currently in nascent stages. As part of our international expansion initiatives, we have targeted markets in various stages of network development to diversify our international exposure and position us to benefit from a number of different wireless technology deployments over the long term. In addition, we have focused on building relationships with large multinational carriers such as Airtel, Telefónica S.A. and Vodafone Group PLC, among others. We believe that consistent carrier network investments across our international markets position us to generate meaningful organic revenue growth going forward. In emerging markets, such as Ghana, India, Kenya, Nigeria and Uganda, wireless networks tend to be significantly less advanced than those in the United States, and initial voice networks continue to be deployed in certain underdeveloped areas. A majority of consumers in these markets still utilize basic wireless services, predominantly on feature phones, while advanced device penetration remains low. In more developed urban locations within these markets, data network deployments are underway. Carriers are focused on completing voice network build-outs while also investing in initial data networks as mobile data usage and smartphone penetration within their customer bases begin to accelerate. In India, the ongoing transition from 2G technology to 4G technology has included a period of carrier consolidation, which we expect to continue through 2019, whereby the number of carriers operating in the marketplace has been reduced through mergers, acquisitions and select carrier exits from the marketplace. Over the long term, this consolidation process is expected to result in a more favorable structural environment for both the wireless carriers as well as communications infrastructure providers. In the shorter term, as described above, the consolidation process continues to result in elevated levels of churn within our India business, as merging carriers rationalize redundant legacy equipment installations and as select carriers exit the marketplace. 26 Table of Contents In markets with rapidly evolving network technology, such as South Africa and most of the countries in Latin America where we do business, initial voice networks, for the most part, have already been built out, and carriers are focused on 3G and 4G network build outs. Consumers in these regions are increasingly adopting smartphones and other advanced devices, in particular as lower cost smartphones become increasingly available. As a result, the usage of bandwidth-intensive mobile applications is growing materially. Recent spectrum auctions in these rapidly evolving markets have allowed incumbent carriers to accelerate their data network deployments and have also enabled new entrants to begin initial investments in data networks. Smartphone penetration and wireless data usage in these markets are advancing rapidly, which typically requires that carriers continue to invest in their networks to maintain and augment their quality of service. Finally, in markets with more mature network technology, such as Germany and France, carriers are focused on deploying 4G data networks to account for rapidly increasing wireless data usage among their customer base. With higher smartphone and advanced device penetration and significantly higher per capita data usage, carrier investment in networks is focused on 4G coverage and capacity. We believe that the network technology migration we have seen in the United States, which has led to significantly denser networks and meaningful new business commencements for us over a number of years, will be replicated in our less advanced international markets over time. As a result, we expect to be able to leverage our extensive international portfolio of approximately 129,930 communications sites and the relationships we have built with our carrier tenants to drive sustainable, long - term growth. We have master lease agreements with certain of our tenants that provide for consistent, long-term revenue and reduce the likelihood of churn. Certain of those master lease agreements are holistic in nature and further build and augment strong strategic partnerships with our tenants and have significantly reduced colocation cycle times, thereby providing our tenants with the ability to rapidly and efficiently deploy equipment on our sites. Demand for our communications sites could be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including an increase in network sharing or consolidation among our tenants, as set forth in Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption “Risk Factors—If our tenants consolidate their operations, exit the telecommunications business or share site infrastructure to a significant degree, our growth, revenue and ability to generate positive cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.” In addition, the emergence and growth of new technologies could reduce demand for our sites, as set forth under the caption “Risk Factors—New technologies or changes in our or a tenant’s business model could make our tower leasing business less desirable and result in decreasing revenues and operating results.” Further, our tenants may be subject to new regulatory policies from time to time that materially and adversely affect the demand for our communications sites. Property Operations New Site Revenue Growth. During the year ended December 31, 2018 , we grew our portfolio of communications real estate through the acquisition and construction of approximately 24,465 sites globally, as well as the acquisition of certain urban telecommunications assets in Brazil. In a majority of our Asia, EMEA and Latin America markets, the revenue generated from newly acquired or constructed sites resulted in increases in both tenant and pass-through revenues (such as ground rent or power and fuel costs) and expenses. We continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire communications real estate portfolios, both domestically and internationally, to determine whether they meet our risk-adjusted hurdle rates and whether we believe we can effectively integrate them into our existing portfolio. New Sites (Acquired or Constructed) 2018 2017 2016 U.S. 285 635 65 Asia 21,470 1,135 43,865 EMEA 1,055 2,755 665 Latin America 1,655 2,360 715 Property Operations Expenses. Direct operating expenses incurred by our property segments include direct site level expenses and consist primarily of ground rent and power and fuel costs, some or all of which may be passed through to our tenants, as well as property taxes, repairs and maintenance. These segment direct operating expenses exclude all segment and corporate selling, general, administrative and development expenses, which are aggregated into one line item entitled Selling, general, administrative and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations. In general, our property segments’ selling, general, administrative and development expenses do not significantly increase as a result of adding incremental tenants to our sites and typically increase only modestly year-over-year. As a result, leasing additional space to new tenants on our sites provides significant incremental cash flow. We may, however, incur additional segment selling, general, administrative and development expenses as we increase our presence in our existing markets or expand into new markets. Our 27 Table of Contents profit margin growth is therefore positively impacted by the addition of new tenants to our sites but can be temporarily diluted by our development activities. Services Segment Revenue Growth . As we continue to focus on growing our property operations, we anticipate that our services revenue will continue to represent a small percentage of our total revenues. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Included in our analysis of our results of operations are discussions regarding earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and accretion, as adjusted (“Adjusted EBITDA”), Funds From Operations, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“Nareit FFO”) attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders, Consolidated Adjusted Funds From Operations (“Consolidated AFFO”) and AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders. We define Adjusted EBITDA as Net income before Income (loss) from equity method investments; Income tax benefit (provision); Other income (expense); Gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations; Interest expense; Interest income; Other operating income (expense); Depreciation, amortization and accretion; and stock-based compensation expense. Nareit FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders is defined as net income before gains or losses from the sale or disposal of real estate, real estate related impairment charges, real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion and dividends on preferred stock, and including adjustments for (i) unconsolidated affiliates and (ii) noncontrolling interests. In this section, we refer to Nareit FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders as “Nareit FFO (common stockholders).” We define Consolidated AFFO as Nareit FFO (common stockholders) before (i) straight-line revenue and expense; (ii) stock-based compensation expense; (iii) the deferred portion of income tax; (iv) non-real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion; (v) amortization of deferred financing costs, capitalized interest, debt discounts and premiums and long-term deferred interest charges; (vi) other income (expense); (vii) gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations; (viii) other operating income (expense); and adjustments for (ix) unconsolidated affiliates and (x) noncontrolling interests, less cash payments related to capital improvements and cash payments related to corporate capital expenditures. We define AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders as Consolidated AFFO, excluding the impact of noncontrolling interests on both Nareit FFO (common stockholders) and the other adjustments included in the calculation of Consolidated AFFO. In this section, we refer to AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders as “AFFO (common stockholders).” Adjusted EBITDA, Nareit FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO and AFFO (common stockholders) are not intended to replace net income or any other performance measures determined in accordance with GAAP. None of Adjusted EBITDA, Nareit FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO or AFFO (common stockholders) represents cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and, therefore, these measures should not be considered indicative of cash flows from operating activities, as a measure of liquidity or a measure of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. Rather, Adjusted EBITDA, Nareit FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO and AFFO (common stockholders) are presented as we believe each is a useful indicator of our current operating performance. We believe that these metrics are useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because (1) each is a key measure used by our management team for decision making purposes and for evaluating our operating segments’ performance; (2) Adjusted EBITDA is a component underlying our credit ratings; (3) Adjusted EBITDA is widely used in the telecommunications real estate sector to measure operating performance as depreciation, amortization and accretion may vary significantly among companies depending upon accounting methods and useful lives, particularly where acquisitions and non-operating factors are involved; (4) Consolidated AFFO is widely used in the telecommunications real estate sector to adjust Nareit FFO (common stockholders) for items that may otherwise cause material fluctuations in Nareit FFO (common stockholders) growth from period to period that would not be representative of the underlying performance of property assets in those periods; (5) each provides investors with a meaningful measure for evaluating our period-to-period operating performance by eliminating items that are not operational in nature; and (6) each provides investors with a measure for comparing our results of operations to those of other companies, particularly those in our industry. Our measurement of Adjusted EBITDA, Nareit FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO and AFFO (common stockholders) may not, however, be fully comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA, Nareit FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO and AFFO (common stockholders) to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, have been included below. 28 Table of Contents Results of Operations Years Ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 (in millions, except percentages) Revenue Year Ended December 31, Percent Change 2018 vs 2017 Percent Change 2017 vs 2016 2018 2017 2016 Property U.S. $ 3,822.1 $ 3,605.7 $ 3,370.1 6 % 7 % Asia 1,540.5 1,164.4 827.6 32 41 EMEA 687.3 626.2 529.5 10 18 Latin America 1,264.8 1,169.6 985.9 8 19 Total property 7,314.7 6,565.9 5,713.1 11 15 Services 125.4 98.0 72.6 28 35 Total revenues $ 7,440.1 $ 6,663.9 $ 5,785.7 12 % 15 % Year ended December 31, 2018 U.S. property segment revenue growth of $216.4 million was attributable to: • Tenant billings growth of $264.0 million, which was driven by: • $188.5 million due to colocations and amendments; • $59.6 million from contractual escalations, net of churn; and • $21.0 million generated from newly acquired or constructed sites; • Partially offset by a decrease of $5.1 million from other tenant billings; and • A decrease of $47.6 million in other revenue, which includes an $81.3 million decrease due to straight-line accounting. Asia property segment revenue growth of $376.1 million was attributable to: • Tenant billings growth of $31.0 million, which was driven by: • $123.7 million generated from newly acquired or constructed sites, including $117.7 million from the transactions with Vodafone (the “Vodafone Acquisition”) and Idea (the “Idea Acquisition”); • $49.5 million due to colocations and amendments; and • $0.6 million from other tenant billings; • Partially offset by a decrease of $142.8 million resulting from churn in excess of contractual escalations, including $128.1 million due to carrier consolidation-driven churn in India; • Pass-through revenue growth of $59.7 million; and • An increase of $349.3 million in other revenue, primarily due to the net impact of our settlement with Tata and a decrease in revenue reserves. The settlement with Tata contributed $333.7 million to other revenue, as a result of the approximately $345.5 million cash settlement payment, partially offset by the net impacts of straight-line accounting and other amounts directly related to the settlement.

We record unrealized foreign currency gains or losses as a result of foreign currency fluctuations primarily associated with our intercompany notes and similar unaffiliated balances denominated in a currency other than the subsidiaries’ functional currencies. The increase in total other expense during the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily due to additional interest expense of $75.9 million due to a $2.0 billion increase in our average debt outstanding and foreign currency losses of $4.5 million in the current period, compared to foreign currency gains of $26.4 million in the prior-year period. The increase was partially offset by (i) a decrease in loss on retirement of long-term obligations of $66.9 million due to the nonrecurrence of a loss of $70.2 million recorded in the prior-year period attributable to the redemptions of the 7.25% senior unsecured notes due 2019 (the “7.25% Notes”) and the 4.500% senior unsecured notes due 2018 (the “4.500% Notes”) and the repayment of the Secured Cellular Site Revenue Notes, Series 2012-2 Class A, Series 2012-2 Class B and Series 2012-2 Class C and Secured Cellular Site Revenue Notes, Series 2010-2, Class C and Series 2010-2, Class F (collectively, the “GTP Notes”), (ii) an increase in other income of $23.4 million partially due to the write-offs of the capital lease liability and Economic Rights Agreement and related amortization in conjunction with the note extinguishment with TV Azteca (as described in note 5 to our consolidated 34 Table of Contents financial statements included in this Annual Report) and (iii) an additional $19.3 million in interest income, compared to the prior-year period. The increase in total other expense during the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to a loss on retirement of long-term obligations of $70.2 million attributable to the redemptions of the 7.25% Notes and the 4.500% Notes and the repayment of the GTP Notes, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, where we recorded a gain on retirement of long-term obligations of $1.2 million attributable to the repayment of the Secured Tower Cellular Site Revenue Notes, Series 2012-1, Class A and the Secured Cellular Site Revenue Notes, Series 2010-1, Class C. The increase was also attributable to additional interest expense of $32.5 million due to a $0.9 billion increase in our average debt outstanding. These items were partially offset by foreign currency gains of $26.4 million compared to foreign currency losses of $48.9 million in the prior-year period, as well an additional $9.8 million in interest income compared to the prior-year period. Income Tax (Benefit) Provision Year Ended December 31, Percent Change 2018 vs 2017 Percent Change 2017 vs 2016 2018 2017 2016 Income tax (benefit) provision $ (110.1 ) $ 30.7 $ 155.5 (459 )% (80 )% Effective tax rate (9.5 )% 2.4 % 13.8 % As a REIT, we may deduct earnings distributed to stockholders against the income generated by our REIT operations. In addition, we are able to offset certain income by utilizing our NOLs, subject to specified limitations. Consequently, the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations for each of the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 differs from the federal statutory rate. The change in the income tax (benefit) provision for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily attributable to the receipt of the payment associated with the Tata settlement, offset by the deferred tax benefit of impairment charges and accelerated amortization in India. Additionally, we restructured our international operations in certain jurisdictions resulting in a current-year benefit of $85.7 million, which was offset by the nonrecurrence of prior-year benefit from a clarification in income tax law in Ghana. The decrease in the income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to lower uncertain tax position reserve recorded in 2017 than in 2016, a decrease in foreign earnings in India due to impairments, as well as changes in tax laws in certain foreign jurisdictions.

During the year ended December 31, 2018 , we generated sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our capital expenditures and debt service obligations, as well as our required distributions. We believe the cash generated by operating activities during the year ending December 31, 2019 , together with our borrowing capacity under our credit facilities, will be sufficient to fund our required distributions, capital expenditures, debt service obligations (interest and principal repayments) and signed acquisitions. As of December 31, 2018 , we had $1.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries, of which $711.6 million was held by our joint ventures. While certain subsidiaries may pay us interest or principal on intercompany debt, it has not been our practice to repatriate earnings from our foreign subsidiaries primarily due to our ongoing expansion efforts and related capital needs. However, in the event that we do repatriate any funds, we may be required to accrue and pay certain taxes. Cash Flows from Operating Activities For the year ended December 31, 2018 , cash provided by operating activities increased $822.7 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The primary factors that impacted cash provided by operating activities as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, include: • An increase in our operating profit of $594.5 million ; • An increase of approximately $77.6 million in cash paid for interest; • A decrease in cash required for working capital, primarily as a result of accounts receivable collection; and • An increase of approximately $27.4 million in cash paid for taxes.

We plan to continue to allocate our available capital, after satisfying our distribution requirements, among investment alternatives that meet our return on investment criteria, while maintaining our commitment to our long-term financial policies. Accordingly, we expect to continue to deploy capital through our annual capital expenditure program, including land purchases and new site construction, and through acquisitions. We also regularly review our tower portfolios as to capital expenditures required to upgrade our towers to our structural standards or address capacity, structural or permitting issues. In 2018, we conducted a review as to whether any additional capital was required for such upgrades and determined that our capital planning was appropriate. We expect that our 2019 total capital expenditures will be between $900.0 million and $1.0 billion , as follows (in millions): Discretionary capital projects (1) $ 265 to $ 305 Ground lease purchases 150 to 160 Capital improvements and corporate expenditures 160 to 180 Redevelopment 255 to 265 Start-up capital projects 70 to 90 Total capital expenditures $ 900 to $ 1,000 _______________ (1) Includes the construction of approximately 2,500 to 3,500 communications sites globally.

Senior Notes 1.950% Senior Notes Offering. On May 22, 2018, we completed a registered public offering of 500.0 million EUR ( $589.0 million at the date of issuance) aggregate principal amount of the 1.950% Notes. The net proceeds from this offering were approximately 493.2 million EUR (approximately $581.0 million at the date of issuance), after deducting commissions and estimated expenses. We used the net proceeds to repay existing indebtedness under the 2013 Credit Facility. The 1.950% Notes will mature on May 22, 2026 and bear interest at a rate of 1.950% per annum. Accrued and unpaid interest on the 1.950% Notes will be payable in EUR in arrears on May 22 of each year, beginning on May 22, 2019. Interest on the 1.950% Notes will be computed on the basis of the actual number of days in the period for which interest is being calculated and the actual number of days from and including the last date on which interest was paid on the 1.950% Notes and commenced accruing on May 22, 2018. We may redeem the 1.950% Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes plus a make-whole premium, together with accrued interest to the redemption date. If we redeem the 1.950% Notes on or after February 22, 2026, we will not be required to pay a make-whole premium. In addition, if we undergo a change of control and corresponding ratings decline, each as defined in the supplemental indenture, we may be required to repurchase all of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of such notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest (including additional interest, if any), up to but not including the repurchase date. The notes rank equally with all of our other senior unsecured debt and are structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of our subsidiaries. The supplemental indenture contains certain covenants that restrict our ability to merge, consolidate or sell assets and our (together with our subsidiaries’) ability to incur liens. These covenants are subject to a number of exceptions, including that we and our subsidiaries may incur certain liens on assets, mortgages or other liens securing indebtedness if the aggregate amount of such liens does not exceed 3.5 x Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the supplemental indenture. Securitizations Repayment of Series 2013-1A Securities . On the March 2018 payment date, we repaid the $500.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Series 2013-1A Securities, pursuant to the terms of the agreements governing such securities. The repayment was funded with borrowings under the 2014 Credit Facility and cash on hand. Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2018-1, Subclass A and Series 2018-1, Subclass R . On March 29, 2018, we completed the 2018 Securitization in which the American Tower Trust I (the “Trust”) issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Series 2018-1A Securities. To satisfy the applicable risk retention requirements of Regulation RR promulgated under the Exchange Act (such requirements, the “Risk Retention Rules”), the Trust issued, and one of our affiliates purchased, $26.4 million aggregate principal amount of Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2018-1, Subclass R (the “Series 2018-1R Securities” and, together with the Series 2018-1A Securities, the “2018 Securities”) to retain an “eligible horizontal residual interest” (as defined in the Risk Retention Rules) in an amount equal to at least 5% of the fair value of the 2018 Securities. The assets of the Trust consist of a nonrecourse loan (the “Loan”) made by the Trust to American Tower Asset Sub, LLC and American Tower Asset Sub II, LLC (together, the “AMT Asset Subs”). The AMT Asset Subs are jointly and severally liable under the Loan, which is secured primarily by mortgages on the AMT Asset Subs’ interests in 5,116 broadcast and wireless communications towers and related assets (the “Trust Sites”). The 2018 Securities correspond to components of the Loan made to the AMT Asset Subs pursuant to the Second Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement among the Trust and the AMT Asset Subs, dated as of March 29, 2018 (the “Loan Agreement”) and were issued in two separate subclasses of the same series. The 2018 Securities represent a pass-through interest in the components of the Loan corresponding to the 2018 Securities. The Series 2018-1A Securities have an interest rate of 3.652% and the Series 2018-1R Securities have an interest rate of 4.459%. The 2018 Securities have an expected life of approximately ten years with a final repayment date in March 2048. The AMT Asset Subs may prepay the Loan in whole or in part at any time provided it is accompanied by applicable prepayment consideration. If the prepayment occurs within 36 months of the anticipated repayment date for the component of 41 Table of Contents the Loan corresponding to the 2018 Securities, no prepayment consideration is due. The entire unpaid principal balance of the components of the Loan corresponding to the 2018 Securities will be due in March 2048. The Loan is secured by (1) mortgages, deeds of trust and deeds to secure debt on substantially all of the Trust Sites and their operating cash flows, (2) a security interest in substantially all of the AMT Asset Subs’ personal property and fixtures and (3) the AMT Asset Subs’ rights under that certain management agreement among the AMT Asset Subs and SpectraSite Communications, LLC entered into in March 2013. American Tower Holding Sub, LLC (the “Guarantor”), whose only material assets are its equity interests in each of the AMT Asset Subs, and American Tower Guarantor Sub, LLC whose only material asset is its equity interests in the Guarantor, have each guaranteed repayment of the Loan and pledged their equity interests in their respective subsidiary or subsidiaries as security for such payment obligations. The Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2013-2A (the “Series 2013-2A Securities”) issued in the 2013 Securitization remain outstanding and are subject to the terms of the Second Amended and Restated Trust and Servicing Agreement entered into in connection with the 2018 Securitization. The component of the Loan corresponding to the Series 2013-2A Securities also remains outstanding and is subject to the terms of the Loan Agreement. For more information regarding the Trust Securitizations, see “—Factors Affecting Sources of Liquidity” below.

On March 29, 2018, we entered into the 2018 Term Loan, the net proceeds of which were used to repay $1.1 billion of outstanding indebtedness under the 2013 Credit Facility and $445.0 million of outstanding indebtedness under the 2014 Credit Facility. The 2018 Term Loan had a maturity date of March 29, 2019. On February 14, 2019, we repaid all amounts outstanding under the 2018 Term Loan with proceeds from the 2019 Term Loan (as defined below) and cash on hand. As of December 31, 2018 , the key terms under the 2013 Credit Facility, the 2014 Credit Facility, the 2013 Term Loan and the 2018 Term Loan were as follows: 42 Table of Contents Bank Facility (1) Outstanding Principal Balance Maturity Date LIBOR borrowing interest rate range (2) Base rate borrowing interest rate range (2) Current margin over LIBOR and the base rate, respectively 2013 Credit Facility $ 1,875.0 June 28, 2022 (3) 0.875% - 1.750% 0.000% - 0.750% 1.125% and 0.125% 2014 Credit Facility $ — January 31, 2024 (3) 0.875% - 1.750% 0.000% - 0.750% 1.125% and 0.125% 2013 Term Loan $ 1,000.0 January 31, 2024 0.875% - 1.750% 0.000% - 0.750% 1.125% and 0.125% 2018 Term Loan $ 1,500.0 March 29, 2019 0.625% - 1.500% 0.000% - 0.500% 0.875% and 0.000% _______________ (1) Currently borrowed at LIBOR. (2) Represents interest rate above LIBOR for LIBOR based borrowings and the interest rate above the defined base rate for base rate borrowings, in each case based on our debt ratings. (3) Subject to two optional renewal periods. The 2013 Credit Facility and the 2014 Credit Facility are subject to two optional renewal periods and we must pay a quarterly commitment fee on the undrawn portion of each facility. The commitment fee for the 2013 Credit Facility and the 2014 Credit Facility ranges from 0.100% to 0.350% per annum, based upon our debt ratings, and is currently 0.125% . 2019 Term Loan . On February 14, 2019, we entered into a $1.3 billion unsecured term loan (the “2019 Term Loan”), the net proceeds of which were used to repay outstanding indebtedness under the 2018 Term Loan. The 2019 Term Loan matures on February 13, 2020 and has an interest rate that ranges between 0.550% and 1.375% above LIBOR for LIBOR based borrowings or up to 0.375% above the defined base rate for base rate borrowings, in each case based upon our debt ratings. The current margin over LIBOR for the 2019 Term Loan is 0.800%. Any outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest will be due and payable in full at maturity. The 2013 Credit Facility, the 2014 Credit Facility, the 2013 Term Loan and the 2019 Term Loan do not require amortization of principal and may be paid prior to maturity in whole or in part at our option without penalty or premium. We have the option of choosing either a defined base rate or the LIBOR as the applicable base rate for borrowings under these bank facilities. The loan agreements for each of the 2013 Credit Facility, the 2014 Credit Facility, the 2013 Term Loan and the 2019 Term Loan contain certain reporting, information, financial and operating covenants and other restrictions (including limitations on additional debt, guaranties, sales of assets and liens) with which we must comply. Failure to comply with the financial and operating covenants of the loan agreements could not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under the revolving credit facilities, but may constitute a default, which could result in, among other things, the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable. India Indebtedness. Amounts outstanding and key terms of the India indebtedness consisted of the following as of December 31, 2018 (in millions, except percentages): Amount Outstanding (INR) Amount Outstanding (USD) Interest Rate (Range) Maturity Date (Range) Term loans (1) 16,751 $ 240.1 8.75% - 8.95% January 1, 2019 - November 30, 2024 Working capital facilities (2) — $ — 8.40% - 8.75% March 18, 2019 - October 23, 2019 _______________ (1) In January 2019, we repaid approximately 5.0 billion INR ($ 72.0 million ) of India indebtedness. (2) 5.7 billion INR ( $81.8 million ) of borrowing capacity as of December 31, 2018. The India indebtedness includes several term loans, with maturities ranging from one to ten years, which are generally secured by the borrower’s short-term and long-term assets. Each of the term loans bear interest at the applicable bank’s Marginal Cost of Funds based Lending Rate (as defined in the applicable agreement), plus a spread. Interest rates on the term loans are fixed until certain reset dates. Generally, the term loans can be repaid without penalty on the reset dates; repayments at dates other than the reset dates are subject to prepayment penalties, typically of 1% to 2% . Scheduled repayment terms include either ratable or staggered amortization with repayments typically commencing between six and thirty-six months after the initial disbursement of funds. The India indebtedness also includes several working capital facilities, most of which are subject to annual renewal, and which are generally secured by the borrower’s short-term and long-term assets. The working capital facilities bear interest at rates that consist of the applicable bank’s Marginal Cost of Funds based Lending Rate (as defined in the applicable agreement), plus a spread. Generally, the working capital facilities are payable on demand prior to maturity. 43 Table of Contents Stock Repurchase Programs. We have two stock repurchase programs, the 2011 Buyback and the 2017 Buyback. During the year ended December 31, 2018 , we repurchased 1,647,489 shares of our common stock under the 2011 Buyback for an aggregate of $232.8 million , including commissions and fees. We had no repurchases under the 2017 Buyback. Under each program, we are authorized to purchase shares from time to time through open market purchases, in privately negotiated transactions not to exceed market prices, and (with respect to such open market purchases) pursuant to plans adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act in accordance with securities laws and other legal requirements, and subject to market conditions and other factors. We expect to continue managing the pacing of the remaining $2.1 billion under the Buyback Programs in response to general market conditions and other relevant factors. We expect to fund further repurchases of our common stock through a combination of cash on hand, cash generated by operations and borrowings under our credit facilities. Purchases under the Buyback Programs are subject to us having available cash to fund repurchases. Sales of Equity Securities. We receive proceeds from sales of our equity securities pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan (the “ESPP”) and upon exercise of stock options granted under our equity incentive plans. For the year ended December 31, 2018 , we received an aggregate of $98.9 million in proceeds upon exercises of stock options and sales pursuant to the ESPP. Distributions. As a REIT, we must annually distribute to our stockholders an amount equal to at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain). Generally, we have distributed, and expect to continue to distribute, all or substantially all of our REIT taxable income after taking into consideration our utilization of NOLs. We have distributed an aggregate of approximately $5.7 billion to our common stockholders, including the dividend paid in January 2019, primarily classified as ordinary income that may be treated as qualified REIT dividends under Section 199A of the Code for taxable years ending after 2017 and before 2026. The amount, timing and frequency of future distributions will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on various factors, a number of which may be beyond our control, including our financial condition and operating cash flows, the amount required to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT and reduce any income and excise taxes that we otherwise would be required to pay, limitations on distributions in our existing and future debt and preferred equity instruments, our ability to utilize NOLs to offset our distribution requirements, limitations on our ability to fund distributions using cash generated through our TRSs and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. In March 2015, we issued 5.50% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, Series B (the “Series B Preferred Stock”) with a dividend rate of 5.50%. Dividends were payable quarterly in arrears, subject to declaration by our Board of Directors. On February 15, 2018, we paid the final dividend of $13.75 per share, or $18.9 million, to holders of the Series B Preferred Stock of record at the close of business on February 1, 2018. On February 15, 2018, all outstanding shares of the Series B Preferred Stock converted at a rate of 8.7420 per share of Series B Preferred Stock, or 0.8742 per depositary share, each representing a 1/10th interest in a share of Series B Preferred Stock, into shares of our common stock pursuant to the provisions of the Certificate of Designations governing the Series B Preferred Stock. As a result of the conversions of the Series B Preferred Stock in 2018, we issued an aggregate of 12,020,064 shares of our common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2018 , we paid $3.01 per share, or $1.3 billion , to common stockholders of record. In addition, we declared a distribution of $0.84 per share, or $370.5 million, paid on January 14, 2019 to our common stockholders of record at the close of business on December 27, 2018. We accrue distributions on unvested restricted stock units, which are payable upon vesting. The amount accrued for distributions payable related to unvested restricted stock units was $13.7 million and $10.1 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2018 , we paid $4.3 million of distributions upon the vesting of restricted stock units.

(10) Includes payments under non-cancellable initial terms, as well as payments for certain renewal periods at our option, which we expect to renew because failure to do so could result in a loss of the applicable communications sites and related revenues from tenant leases. (11) Primarily represents our asset retirement obligations and excludes certain other non-current liabilities included in our consolidated balance sheet, primarily our straight-line rent liability for which cash payments are included in operating lease payments and unearned revenue that is not payable in cash. (12) Excludes $85.8 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax positions and $19.1 million of accrued income tax related interest and penalties included in our consolidated balance sheet as we are uncertain as to when and if the amounts may be settled. Settlement of such amounts could require the use of cash flows generated from operations. We expect the unrecognized tax benefits to change over the next 12 months if certain tax matters ultimately settle with the applicable taxing jurisdiction during this timeframe. However, based on the status of these items and the amount of uncertainty associated with the outcome and timing of audit settlements, we are currently unable to estimate the impact of the amount of such changes, if any, to previously recorded uncertain tax positions. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. We have no material off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K. Factors Affecting Sources of Liquidity Our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities, borrow funds under our credit facilities and maintain compliance with the contractual agreements governing our indebtedness. We believe that the debt agreements discussed below represent our material debt agreements that contain covenants, our compliance with which would be material to an investor’s understanding of our financial results and the impact of those results on our liquidity. Internally Generated Funds . Because the majority of our tenant leases are multiyear contracts, a significant majority of the revenues generated by our property operations as of the end of 2018 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. Accordingly, a key factor affecting our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is to maintain this recurring revenue and to convert it into operating profit by minimizing operating costs and fully achieving our operating efficiencies. In addition, our ability to increase cash flow from operating activities depends upon the demand for our communications sites and our related services and our ability to increase the utilization of our existing communications sites. Restrictions Under Loan Agreements Relating to Our Credit Facilities. The loan agreements for the 2013 Credit Facility, the 2014 Credit Facility, the 2013 Term Loan, the 2018 Term Loan and the 2019 Term Loan contain certain financial and operating covenants and other restrictions applicable to us and our subsidiaries that are not designated as unrestricted subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. These restrictions include limitations on additional debt, distributions and dividends, guaranties, sales of assets and liens. The loan agreements also contain covenants that establish financial tests with which we and our restricted subsidiaries must comply related to total leverage and senior secured leverage, as set forth in the table below. In the event that our debt ratings fall below investment grade, we must also maintain an interest coverage ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to Interest Expense (each as defined in the applicable loan agreement) of at least 2.50:1.00. As of December 31, 2018 , we were in compliance with each of these covenants. Compliance Tests For The 12 Months Ended December 31, 2018 ($ in billions) Ratio (1) Additional Debt Capacity Under Covenants (2) Capacity for Adjusted EBITDA Decrease Under Covenants (3) Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ≤ 6.00:1.00 ~ $7.6 ~ $1.3 Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio Senior Secured Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ≤ 3.00:1.00 ~ $11.2 (4) ~ $3.7 (4) _______________ 46 Table of Contents (1) Each component of the ratio as defined in the applicable loan agreement. (2) Assumes no change to Adjusted EBITDA. (3) Assumes no change to our debt levels. (4) Effectively, however, additional Senior Secured Debt under this ratio would be limited to the capacity under the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio. The loan agreements for our credit facilities also contain reporting and information covenants that require us to provide financial and operating information to the lenders within certain time periods. If we are unable to provide the required information on a timely basis, we would be in breach of these covenants. Failure to comply with the financial maintenance tests and certain other covenants of the loan agreements for our credit facilities could not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under these credit facilities, but may constitute a default under these credit facilities, which could result in, among other things, the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable. If this were to occur, we may not have sufficient cash on hand to repay such indebtedness. The key factors affecting our ability to comply with the debt covenants described above are our financial performance relative to the financial maintenance tests defined in the loan agreements for these credit facilities and our ability to fund our debt service obligations. Based upon our current expectations, we believe our operating results during the next 12 months will be sufficient to comply with these covenants. Restrictions Under Agreements Relating to the 2015 Securitization and the Trust Securitizations . The indenture and related supplemental indentures governing the American Tower Secured Revenue Notes, Series 2015-1, Class A (the “Series 2015-1 Notes”) and the American Tower Secured Revenue Notes, Series 2015-2, Class A (the “Series 2015-2 Notes,” and, together with the Series 2015-1 Notes, the “2015 Notes”) issued by GTP Acquisition Partners I, LLC (“GTP Acquisition Partners”) in the 2015 Securitization and the loan agreement related to the Trust Securitizations include certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions customary for transactions subject to rated securitizations. Among other things, GTP Acquisition Partners and the AMT Asset Subs are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets, subject to customary carve-outs for ordinary course trade payables and permitted encumbrances (as defined in the applicable agreement). Under the agreements, amounts due will be paid from the cash flows generated by the assets securing the 2015 Notes or the Loan, as applicable, which must be deposited into certain reserve accounts, and thereafter distributed solely pursuant to the terms of the applicable agreement. On a monthly basis, after payment of all required amounts under the applicable agreement, subject to the conditions described in the table below, the excess cash flows generated from the operation of such assets are released to GTP Acquisition Partners or the AMT Asset Subs, as applicable, which can then be distributed to, and used by, us. As of December 31, 2018 , $80.1 million held in such reserve accounts was classified as restricted cash. Certain information with respect to the 2015 Securitization and the Trust Securitizations is set forth below. The debt service coverage ratio (“DSCR”) is generally calculated as the ratio of the net cash flow (as defined in the applicable agreement) to the amount of interest, servicing fees and trustee fees required to be paid over the succeeding 12 months on the principal amount of the 2015 Notes or the Loan, as applicable, that will be outstanding on the payment date following such date of determination. 47 Table of Contents Issuer or Borrower Notes/Securities Issued Conditions Limiting Distributions of Excess Cash Excess Cash Distributed During Year Ended December 31, 2018 DSCR as of December 31, 2018 Capacity for Decrease in Net Cash Flow Before Triggering Cash Trap DSCR (1) Capacity for Decrease in Net Cash Flow Before Triggering Minimum DSCR (1) Cash Trap DSCR Amortization Period (in millions) (in millions) (in millions) 2015 Securitization GTP Acquisition Partners American Tower Secured Revenue Notes, Series 2015-1 and Series 2015-2 1.30x, Tested Quarterly (2) (3)(4) $197.3 8.67x $196.9 $200.9 Trust Securitizations AMT Asset Subs Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2013-2A, Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2018-1, Subclass A and Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2018-1, Subclass R 1.30x, Tested Quarterly (2) (3)(5) $612.9 10.65x $558.4 $567.4 _______________ (1) Based on the net cash flow of the applicable issuer or borrower as of December 31, 2018 and the expenses payable over the next 12 months on the 2015 Notes or the Loan, as applicable. (2) Once triggered, a Cash Trap DSCR condition continues to exist until the DSCR exceeds the Cash Trap DSCR for two consecutive calendar quarters. During a Cash Trap DSCR condition, all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments, fund required reserves, pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and make other payments required under the applicable transaction documents, referred to as excess cash flow, will be deposited into a reserve account (the “Cash Trap Reserve Account”) instead of being released to the applicable issuer or borrower. (3) An amortization period commences if the DSCR is equal to or below 1.15x (the “Minimum DSCR”) at the end of any calendar quarter and continues to exist until the DSCR exceeds the Minimum DSCR for two consecutive calendar quarters. (4) No amortization period is triggered if the outstanding principal amount of a series has not been repaid in full on the applicable anticipated repayment date. However, in such event, additional interest will accrue on the unpaid principal balance of the applicable series, and such series will begin to amortize on a monthly basis from excess cash flow. (5) An amortization period exists if the outstanding principal amount has not been paid in full on the applicable anticipated repayment date and continues to exist until such principal has been repaid in full. A failure to meet the noted DSCR tests could prevent GTP Acquisition Partners or the AMT Asset Subs from distributing excess cash flow to us, which could affect our ability to fund our capital expenditures, including tower construction and acquisitions and meet REIT distribution requirements. During an “amortization period,” all excess cash flow and any amounts in the applicable Cash Trap Reserve Account would be applied to pay principal of the 2015 Notes or the Loan, as applicable, on each monthly payment date, and so would not be available for distribution to us. Further, additional interest will begin to accrue with respect to any series of the 2015 Notes or subclass of the Loan from and after the anticipated repayment date at a per annum rate determined in accordance with the applicable agreement. With respect to the 2015 Notes, upon the occurrence and during an event of default, the applicable trustee may, in its discretion or at the direction of holders of more than 50% of the aggregate outstanding principal of any series of the 2015 Notes, declare such series of 2015 Notes immediately due and payable, in which case any excess cash flow would need to be used to pay holders of such notes. Furthermore, if GTP Acquisition Partners or the AMT Asset Subs were to default on a series of the 2015 Notes or the Loan, the applicable trustee may seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of all or any portion of the 3,556 communications sites that secure the 2015 Notes or the 5,116 broadcast and wireless communications towers and related assets that secure the Loan, respectively, in which case we could lose such sites and the revenue associated with those assets. As discussed above, we use our available liquidity and seek new sources of liquidity to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, satisfy our distribution requirements and repay or repurchase our debt. If we determine that it is desirable or necessary to raise additional capital, we may be unable to do so, or such additional financing may be prohibitively expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness. If we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise, we may not be able to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, satisfy our REIT distribution requirements and debt service obligations or refinance our existing indebtedness. 48 Table of Contents In addition, our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities. As set forth under Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption “Risk Factors,” we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a small number of tenants and, consequently, a failure by a significant tenant to perform its contractual obligations to us could adversely affect our cash flow and liquidity. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We have reviewed our policies and estimates to determine our critical accounting policies for the year ended December 31, 2018 . We have identified the following policies as critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition. This is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies. See note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for a summary of our significant accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP, with no need for management’s judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result. • Impairment of Assets—Assets Subject to Depreciation and Amortization : We review long-lived assets for impairment at least annually or whenever events, changes in circumstances or other indicators or evidence indicate that the carrying amount of our assets may not be recoverable. We review our tower portfolio and network location intangible assets for indicators of impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, typically at an individual tower basis. Possible indicators include a tower not having current tenant leases or having expenses in excess of revenues. A cash flow modeling approach is utilized to assess recoverability and incorporates, among other items, the tower location, the tower location demographics, the timing of additions of new tenants, lease rates and estimated length of tenancy and ongoing cash requirements. We review our tenant-related intangible assets on a tenant by tenant basis for indicators of impairment, such as high levels of turnover or attrition, non-renewal of a significant number of contracts or the cancellation or termination of a relationship. We assess recoverability by determining whether the carrying amount of the tenant-related intangible assets will be recovered primarily through projected undiscounted future cash flows. If the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of our long-lived assets is less than the carrying amount of the assets, an impairment loss may be recognized. An impairment loss would be based on the fair value of the asset, which is based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows to be provided from the asset. We record any related impairment charge in the period in which we identify such impairment. On February 28, 2018, one of our tenants in Asia, Aircel, filed for bankruptcy protection. We performed an impairment test based on current expectations of the impact of the bankruptcy on projected cash flows for assets related to Aircel. These assets consisted primarily of towers, network location intangibles and tenant-related intangibles. As a result, an impairment of $40.1 million was taken on the tower and network intangible assets. We also fully impaired the tenant-related intangible asset for Aircel, which resulted in an impairment of $107.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. In October 2017, one of our tenants in Asia, Tata Teleservices, informed the Department of Telecommunications in India of its intent to exit the wireless telecommunications business and announced plans to transfer its business to another telecommunications provider. On October 23, 2018, we entered into agreements with Tata for a settlement and release of certain contractual lease obligations effective November 1, 2018. As part of the arrangement, we received an upfront one-time INR-denominated cash payment equal to approximately $345.5 million for the termination of lease obligations with Tata Teleservices in India. In addition, we entered into new leasing arrangements with a number of Tata-affiliated entities. As a result of the settlement and new leasing agreements, we expect an approximately 80% reduction in revenues from Tata as compared to what had previously been generated from the terminated leases. In connection with the acceleration of the contractual arrangements, we also accelerated the amortization of our tenant- 49 Table of Contents related intangible asset with Tata Teleservices, which resulted in an additional amortization expense of $327.5 million in 2018. We also recorded an impairment of $164.2 million for tower and network location intangible assets as a result of the settlement. Impairment of Assets—Goodwill: We review goodwill for impairment at least annually (as of December 31) or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill is recorded in the applicable segment and assessed for impairment at the reporting unit level. We utilize the two step impairment test and employ a discounted cash flow analysis when testing goodwill for impairment. The key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance, terminal sales growth rate, management’s expectations of future operating results and cash requirements, the current weighted average cost of capital and an expected tax rate. Under the first step of this test, we compare the fair value of the reporting unit, as calculated under an income approach using future discounted cash flows, to the carrying amount of the applicable reporting unit. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, we conduct the second step of this test, in which the implied fair value of the applicable reporting unit’s goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount of the excess. During the year ended December 31, 2018 , no potential impairment was identified as the fair value of each of our reporting units was in excess of its carrying amount. The fair value of our India reporting unit, which is based on the present value of forecasted future value cash flows (the income approach) exceeded the carrying value by approximately $311.1 million, or 8%. Key assumptions include future revenue growth rates and operating margins, capital expenditures, terminal period growth rate and the weighted-average cost of capital, which were determined considering historical data and current assumptions related to the impacts of the carrier consolidation. For this reporting unit, we performed a sensitivity analysis on our significant assumptions and determined that a (i) 6% reduction of projected revenues, (ii) 58 basis point increase in the weighted-average cost of capital or (iii) 28% reduction in terminal sales growth rate, individually, each of which we determined to be reasonable, would impact our conclusion that the fair value of the India reporting unit exceeds its carrying value. Events that could negatively affect our India reporting unit’s financial results include increased customer attrition exceeding our forecast resulting from the ongoing carrier consolidation, carrier tenant bankruptcies and other factors set forth in Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption “Risk Factors.” The carrying value of goodwill in the India reporting unit was $1,045.5 million as of December 31, 2018, which represents 19% of our consolidated balance of $5,501.9 million. • Asset Retirement Obligations: When required, we recognize the fair value of obligations to remove our tower assets and remediate the leased land upon which certain of our tower assets are located. Generally, the associated retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related tower assets and depreciated over their estimated useful lives and the liability is accreted through the obligation’s estimated settlement date. We updated our assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation, which resulted in a net decrease in the estimated obligation of $14.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 . The change in 2018 primarily resulted from changes in timing of certain settlement date and cost assumptions. Fair value estimates of liabilities for asset retirement obligations generally involve discounting of estimated future cash flows. Periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is included in Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense in the consolidated statements of operations. The significant assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation are: timing of tower removals; cost of tower removals; timing and number of land lease renewals; expected inflation rates; and credit-adjusted risk-free interest rates that approximate our incremental borrowing rate. While we feel the assumptions are appropriate, there can be no assurances that actual costs and the probability of incurring obligations will not differ from these estimates. We will continue to review these assumptions periodically and we may need to adjust them as necessary. • Acquisitions : We evaluate each of our acquisitions under the accounting guidance framework to determine whether to treat an acquisition as an asset acquisition or a business combination. For those transactions treated as asset acquisitions, the purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired, with no recognition of goodwill. For those acquisitions that meet the definition of a business combination, we apply the acquisition method of accounting where assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value at the date of each acquisition, and the results of operations are included with our results from the dates of the respective acquisitions. Any excess of the purchase price paid over the amounts recognized for assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. We continue to 50 Table of Contents evaluate acquisitions accounted for as business combinations for a period not to exceed one year after the applicable acquisition date of each transaction to determine whether any additional adjustments are needed to the allocation of the purchase price paid for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is typically determined by using either estimates of replacement costs or discounted cash flow valuation methods. When determining the fair value of tangible assets acquired, we must estimate the cost to replace the asset with a new asset taking into consideration such factors as age, condition and the economic useful life of the asset. When determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired, we must estimate the applicable discount rate and the timing and amount of future tenant cash flows, including rate and terms of renewal and attrition. • Revenue Recognition: Our revenue from leasing arrangements, including fixed escalation clauses present in non-cancellable lease arrangements, is reported on a straight-line basis over the term of the respective leases when collectibility is probable. Escalation clauses tied to the Consumer Price Index or other inflation-based indices, and other incentives present in lease agreements with our tenants are excluded from the straight-line calculation. Total property straight-line revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 were $87.6 million , $194.4 million and $131.7 million, respectively. Amounts billed upfront in connection with the execution of lease agreements are initially deferred and reflected in Unearned revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and recognized as revenue over the terms of the applicable lease arrangements. Amounts billed or received for services prior to being earned are deferred and reflected in Unearned revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets until the criteria for recognition have been met. We derive the largest portion of our revenues, corresponding trade receivables and the related deferred rent asset from a small number of tenants in the telecommunications industry, with 51% of our revenues derived from four tenants. In addition, we have concentrations of credit risk in certain geographic areas. We mitigate the concentrations of credit risk with respect to notes and trade receivables by actively monitoring the creditworthiness of our borrowers and tenants. In recognizing tenant revenue we assess the collectibility of both the amounts billed and the portion recognized on a straight-line basis. This assessment takes tenant credit risk and business and industry conditions into consideration to ultimately determine the collectibility of the amounts billed. To the extent the amounts, based on management’s estimates, may not be collectible, recognition is deferred until such point as the uncertainty is resolved. Any amounts that were previously recognized as revenue and subsequently determined to be uncollectible are charged to bad debt expense. Accounts receivable are reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts related to estimated losses resulting from a tenant’s inability to make required payments and allowances for amounts invoiced whose collectibility is not reasonably assured. • Rent Expense: Many of the leases underlying our tower sites have fixed rent escalations, which provide for periodic increases in the amount of ground rent payable over time. In addition, certain of our tenant leases require us to exercise available renewal options pursuant to the underlying ground lease if the tenant exercises its renewal option. We calculate straight-line ground rent expense for these leases based on the fixed non-cancellable term of the underlying ground lease plus all periods, if any, for which failure to renew the lease imposes an economic penalty to us such that renewal appears to be reasonably assured. Effective January 1, 2019, we will adopt the new lease accounting guidance, which requires us to recognize a Right of Use (“ROU”) lease asset and lease liability for operating and finance leases. The ROU asset will be measured as the sum of the lease liability, prepaid or accrued lease payments, any initial direct costs incurred and any other applicable amounts. The calculation of the lease liability requires us to make certain assumptions for each lease, including lease term and discount rate implicit in each lease, which could significantly impact the gross lease obligation, the duration and the present value of the lease liability. When calculating the lease term, we will consider the renewal, cancellation and termination rights available to us and the lessor. We will determine the discount rate by calculating the incremental borrowing rate on a collateralized basis at the commencement of a lease or upon a change in the lease term. • Income Taxes: Accounting for income taxes requires us to estimate the timing and impact of amounts recorded in our financial statements that may be recognized differently for tax purposes. To the extent that the timing of amounts recognized for financial reporting purposes differs from the timing of recognition for tax reporting purposes, deferred tax assets or liabilities are required to be recorded. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on the rate at which we expect these items to be reflected in our tax returns, which may differ from the current rate. We do not expect to pay federal income taxes on our REIT taxable income. We periodically review our deferred tax assets, and we record a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management 51 Table of Contents assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets. Valuation allowances would be reversed as a reduction to the provision for income taxes, if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based on changes in facts and circumstances relevant to the assets’ recoverability. We recognize the benefit of uncertain tax positions when, in management’s judgment, it is more likely than not that positions we have taken in our tax returns will be sustained upon examination, which are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. We adjust our tax liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information or information not previously available. Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which additional information is available or the position is ultimately settled under audit. The December 2017 legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) significantly changed how the U.S. taxes corporations. The Tax Act contains several key provisions including, among other things, a one-time mandatory deemed repatriation of all post-1986 untaxed foreign earnings and profits, a reduction in the corporate income rate from 35% to 21% for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 and the introduction of a new U.S. tax on certain off-shore earnings. The SEC staff issued guidance to address the application of GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared or analyzed in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act and allows the registrant to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year from the enactment date. We recognized the provisional impacts of the Tax Act in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017 and finalized these amounts in 2018 with no significant changes to preliminary amounts. Accounting Standards Update For a discussion of recent accounting standards updates, see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.

(g) Represents the weighted average variable rate of interest based on contractual notional amount as a percentage of total notional amounts. Interest Rate Risk As of December 31, 2018 , we have one interest rate swap agreement related to debt in Colombia. This swap has been designated as a cash flow hedge, has a notional amount of $16.9 million and has an interest rate of 5.74% and expires in April 2021. We have three interest rate swap agreements related to the 2.250% Notes. These swaps have been designated as fair value hedges, have an aggregate notional amount of $600.0 million and an interest rate of one-month LIBOR plus applicable spreads and expire in January 2022. In addition, we have three interest rate swap agreements related to a portion of the 3.000% Notes. These swaps have been designated as fair value hedges, have an aggregate notional amount of $500.0 million and have an interest rate of one-month LIBOR plus applicable spreads and expire in June 2023. Changes in interest rates can cause interest charges to fluctuate on our variable rate debt. Variable rate debt as of December 31, 2018 consisted of $1.9 billion under the 2013 Credit Facility, $1.0 billion under the 2013 Term Loan, $1.5 billion under the 2018 Term Loan, $600.0 million under the interest rate swap agreements related to the 2.250% Notes, $500.0 million under the interest rate swap agreements related to the 3.000% Notes, $40.6 million under the South African credit facility, $16.9 million under the Colombian credit facility after giving effect to our interest rate swap agreements and $24.7 million under the Brazil credit facility. A 10% increase in current interest rates would result in an additional $20.2 million of interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 . 53 Table of Contents Foreign Currency Risk We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily in connection with our foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures internationally. Any transaction denominated in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar is reported in U.S. Dollars at the applicable exchange rate. All assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. Dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of the applicable fiscal reporting period and all revenues and expenses are translated at average rates for the period. The cumulative translation effect is included in equity as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We may enter into additional foreign currency financial instruments in anticipation of future transactions to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. For the year ended December 31, 2018 , 47% of our revenues and 57% of our total operating expenses were denominated in foreign currencies. As of December 31, 2018 , we have incurred intercompany debt that is not considered to be permanently reinvested, and similar unaffiliated balances that were denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the subsidiary in which it is recorded. As this debt had not been designated as being a long-term investment in nature, any changes in the foreign currency exchange rates will result in unrealized gains or losses, which will be included in our determination of net income. An adverse change of 10% in the underlying exchange rates of our unsettled intercompany debt and similar unaffiliated balances would result in $110.9 million of unrealized losses that would be included in Other expense in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 . ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA See Item 15 (a). ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures We have established disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that material information relating to us, including our consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to the officers who certify our financial reports and to other members of senior management and the Board of Directors. Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2018 and designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the requisite time periods specified in the applicable rules and forms, and that it is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 . In making its assessment of internal control over financial reporting, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) . Based on this assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2018 , our internal control over financial reporting is effective. 54 Table of Contents Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm that audited our financial statements included in this Annual Report, has issued an attestation report on management’s internal control over financial reporting, which is included in this Item 9A under the caption “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm.” Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2018 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 55 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of American Tower Corporation Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of American Tower Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018, of the Company and our report dated February 27, 2019, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP Boston, Massachusetts February 27, 2019 56 Table of Contents PART III ITEM 10.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 27, 2019, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP Boston, Massachusetts February 27, 2019 We have served as the Company's auditor since 1997.

F-7 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) 1. BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Business —American Tower Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, “ATC” or the “Company”) is one of the largest global real estate investment trusts and a leading independent owner, operator and developer of multitenant communications real estate. The Company’s primary business is the leasing of space on communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, wireless data providers, government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries. The Company refers to this business as its property operations. Additionally, the Company offers tower-related services in the United States, which the Company refers to as its services operations. These services include site acquisition, zoning and permitting (“AZP”) and structural analysis, which primarily support the Company’s site leasing business, including the addition of new tenants and equipment on its sites. The Company’s portfolio primarily consists of towers that it owns and towers that it operates pursuant to long-term lease arrangements, as well as distributed antenna system (“DAS”) networks, which provide seamless coverage solutions in certain in-building and certain outdoor wireless environments. In addition to the communications sites in its portfolio, the Company manages rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements. The Company also holds other telecommunications infrastructure, fiber and property interests that it leases primarily to communications service providers and third-party tower operators. American Tower Corporation is a holding company that conducts its operations through its directly and indirectly owned subsidiaries and joint ventures. ATC’s principal domestic operating subsidiaries are American Towers LLC and SpectraSite Communications, LLC. ATC conducts its international operations primarily through its subsidiary, American Tower International, Inc., which in turn conducts operations through its various international holding and operating subsidiaries and joint ventures. The Company operates as a real estate investment trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes (“REIT”). Accordingly, the Company generally is not required to pay U.S. federal income taxes on income generated by its REIT operations, including the income derived from leasing space on its towers, as it receives a dividends paid deduction for distributions to stockholders that generally offsets its REIT income and gains. However, the Company remains obligated to pay U.S. federal income taxes on earnings from its domestic taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRSs”). In addition, the Company’s international assets and operations, regardless of their classification for U.S. tax purposes, continue to be subject to taxation in the jurisdictions where those assets are held or those operations are conducted. The use of TRSs enables the Company to continue to engage in certain businesses while complying with REIT qualification requirements. The Company may, from time to time, change the election of previously designated TRSs to be included as part of the REIT. As of December 31, 2018 , the Company’s REIT-qualified businesses included its U.S. tower leasing business, its operations in Nigeria, most of its operations in Costa Rica and Mexico, a majority of its operations in Germany and a majority of its indoor DAS networks business and services segment. In January 2019, a majority of the Company’s operations in France became part of the REIT. Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation —The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and those entities in which it has a controlling interest. Investments in entities that the Company does not control are accounted for using the equity or cost method, depending upon the Company’s ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. As of December 31, 2018, the Company holds (i) a 51% controlling interest, and MTN Group Limited holds a 49% noncontrolling interest, in each of two joint ventures, one in Ghana and one in Uganda, (ii) a 51% controlling interest, and PGGM holds a 49% noncontrolling interest, in a joint venture that primarily consists of the Company’s operations in Germany and France, (iii) an approximate 81% controlling interest, and South African investors hold an approximate 19% noncontrolling interest, in a subsidiary of the Company in South Africa and (iv) a 63% controlling interest in ATC Telecom Infrastructure Private Limited (“ATC TIPL”), formerly Viom Networks Limited (“Viom”), in India. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company purchased approximately 6% of the interest in a subsidiary of the Company in South Africa from one of its local partners for $20.5 million , which resulted in an increase in the Company’s controlling interest from approximately 75% to approximately 81% . The purchase is reflected in the consolidated statements of equity as a reduction of Additional paid-in capital of $16.5 million , a decrease in Accumulated other comprehensive loss of $0.5 million and a reduction in Noncontrolling interest of $4.5 million . F-8 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) Significant Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates —The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results may differ from those estimates, and such differences could be material to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The significant estimates in the accompanying consolidated financial statements include impairment of long-lived assets (including goodwill), asset retirement obligations, revenue recognition, rent expense, income taxes and accounting for business combinations and acquisitions of assets. The Company considers events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued as additional evidence for certain estimates or to identify matters that require additional disclosure. Accounts Receivable and Deferred Rent Asset —The Company derives the largest portion of its revenues, corresponding accounts receivable and the related deferred rent asset from a relatively small number of tenants in the telecommunications industry, and 51% of its current-year revenues are derived from four tenants. The Company’s deferred rent asset is associated with non-cancellable tenant leases that contain fixed escalation clauses over the terms of the applicable lease in which revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company mitigates its concentrations of credit risk with respect to notes and trade receivables and the related deferred rent assets by actively monitoring the creditworthiness of its borrowers and tenants. In recognizing tenant revenue, the Company assesses the collectibility of both the amounts billed and the portion recognized in advance of billing on a straight-line basis. This assessment takes tenant credit risk and business and industry conditions into consideration to ultimately determine the collectibility of the amounts billed. To the extent the amounts, based on management’s estimates, may not be collectible, recognition is deferred until such point as collectibility is determined to be reasonably assured. Any amounts that were previously recognized as revenue and subsequently determined to be uncollectible are charged to bad debt expense included in Selling, general, administrative and development expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Accounts receivable is reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts related to estimated losses resulting from a tenant’s inability to make required payments and allowances for amounts invoiced whose collectibility is not reasonably assured. These allowances are generally estimated based on payment patterns, days past due and collection history, and incorporate changes in economic conditions that may not be reflected in historical trends, such as tenants in bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization. Receivables are written-off against the allowances when they are determined to be uncollectible. Such determination includes analysis and consideration of the particular conditions of the account. Changes in the allowances were as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 Balance as of January 1, $ 131.0 $ 45.9 $ 23.1 Current year increases 157.8 87.2 50.0 Write-offs, recoveries and other (1) (6.4 ) (2.1 ) (27.2 ) Balance as of December 31, $ 282.4 $ 131.0 $ 45.9 _______________ (1) Recoveries includes recognition of revenue resulting from collections of previously reserved amounts. Functional Currency —The functional currency of each of the Company’s foreign operating subsidiaries is normally the respective local currency, except for Costa Rica, where the functional currency is the U.S. Dollar. All foreign currency assets and liabilities held by the subsidiaries are translated into U.S. Dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the end of the applicable fiscal reporting period and all foreign currency revenues and expenses are translated at the average monthly exchange rates. Translation adjustments are reflected in equity as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss (“AOCL”) in the consolidated balance sheets and included as a component of Comprehensive income in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Gains and losses on foreign currency transactions are reflected in Other expense in the consolidated statements of operations. However, the effect from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on intercompany debt for which repayment is not anticipated in the foreseeable future is reflected in AOCL in the consolidated balance sheets and included as a component of comprehensive income. F-9 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) The Company recorded the following net foreign currency losses: Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 Foreign currency losses recorded in AOCL $ 385.8 $ 51.6 $ 105.0 Foreign currency losses (gains) recorded in Other expense 4.5 (26.4 ) 48.9 Net foreign currency losses $ 390.3 $ 25.2 $ 153.9 Adoption of Highly Inflationary Accounting in Argentina —The Argentinean economy was deemed to be highly inflationary as of the second quarter of 2018 and, as a result, the Company adopted highly inflationary accounting as of July 1, 2018 for its subsidiary in Argentina. Under highly inflationary accounting, the functional currency of its subsidiary in Argentina is considered to be the U.S. Dollar. All monetary and non-monetary assets and liabilities were remeasured at the U.S. Dollar to Argentinean Peso exchange rate of 1 to 29.4 as of June 30, 2018. These amounts became the new basis for those assets and liabilities as of July 1, 2018. Non-monetary assets and liabilities, as well as the corresponding income statement activities such as depreciation, amortization and equity, will continue to be measured at the June 30, 2018 exchange rate. This change did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements as Argentina’s assets and revenue are less than 1% of consolidated assets and revenue, respectively. Cash and Cash Equivalents —Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, demand deposits and short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less. The Company maintains its deposits at high quality financial institutions and monitors the credit ratings of those institutions. Restricted Cash— Restricted cash includes cash pledged as collateral to secure obligations and all cash whose use is otherwise limited by contractual provisions. The reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash reported within the applicable balance sheet that sum to the total of the same such amounts shown in the statement of cash flows is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,208.7 $ 802.1 $ 787.2 Restricted cash 96.2 152.8 149.3 Total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 1,304.9 $ 954.9 $ 936.5 Short-Term Investments— Short-term investments consists of highly liquid investments with original maturities in excess of three months. Property and Equipment —Property and equipment is recorded at cost or, in the case of acquired properties, at estimated fair value on the date acquired. Cost for self-constructed towers includes direct materials and labor, capitalized interest and certain indirect costs associated with construction of the tower, such as transportation costs, employee benefits and payroll taxes. The Company begins the capitalization of costs during the pre-construction period, which is the period during which costs are incurred to evaluate the site, and continues to capitalize costs until the tower is substantially completed and ready for occupancy by a tenant. Labor and related costs capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 were $55.0 million , $50.9 million and $47.7 million , respectively. Capitalized interest costs were not material for the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 . Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Augmentation and improvements that extend an asset’s useful life or enhance capacity are capitalized. Depreciation expense is recorded using the straight-line method over the assets’ estimated useful lives. Towers and related assets on leased land are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the term of the corresponding ground lease, taking into consideration lease renewal options and residual value. Towers or assets acquired through capital leases are recorded net at the present value of future minimum lease payments or the fair value of the leased asset at the inception of the lease. Property and equipment and assets held under capital leases are F-10 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) amortized over the shorter of the applicable lease term or the estimated useful life of the respective assets for periods generally not exceeding twenty years. The Company reviews its tower portfolio for indicators of impairment on an individual tower basis. Impairments primarily result from a tower not having current tenant leases or from having expenses in excess of revenues. The Company reviews other long-lived assets for impairment whenever events, changes in circumstances or other evidence indicate that the carrying amount of the Company’s assets may not be recoverable. The Company records impairment charges in Other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the Company identifies such impairment. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets —The Company reviews goodwill for impairment at least annually (as of December 31) or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill is recorded in the applicable segment and assessed for impairment at the reporting unit level. The Company utilizes the two-step impairment test and employs a discounted cash flow analysis when testing goodwill for impairment. The key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance, terminal sales growth rate, management’s expectations of future operating results and cash requirements, the current weighted average cost of capital and an expected tax rate. Under the first step of the test, the Company compares the fair value of the reporting unit, as calculated under an income approach using future discounted cash flows, to the carrying amount of the applicable reporting unit. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, the Company conducts the second step of this test, in which the implied fair value of the applicable reporting unit’s goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount of the excess. During the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , no potential impairment was identified under the first step of the test, as the fair value of each of the reporting units was in excess of its carrying amount. Intangible assets that are separable from goodwill and are deemed to have a definite life are amortized over their useful lives, generally ranging from three to twenty years and are evaluated separately for impairment at least annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The Company reviews its network location intangible assets for indicators of impairment on an individual tower basis. Impairments primarily result from a tower not having current tenant leases or from having expenses in excess of revenues. The Company monitors its tenant-related intangible assets on a tenant by tenant basis for indicators of impairment, such as high levels of turnover or attrition, non-renewal of a significant number of contracts or the cancellation or termination of a relationship. The Company assesses recoverability by determining whether the carrying amount of the related assets will be recovered primarily through projected undiscounted future cash flows. If the Company determines that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, the Company measures any impairment loss based on the projected future discounted cash flows to be provided from the asset or available market information relative to the asset’s fair value, as compared to the asset’s carrying amount. The Company records impairment charges, which are discussed in note 16, in Other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the Company identifies such impairment. Derivative Financial Instruments —Derivatives are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value. If a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in AOCL, as well as a component of comprehensive income, and are recognized in the results of operations when the hedged item affects earnings. Changes in fair value of the ineffective portions of cash flow hedges are recognized in the results of operations. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, changes in value of the derivatives are recorded in Other expense in the consolidated statements of operations in the current period, along with the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. For derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognized in the results of operations in the period that the change occurs. The primary risks managed through the use of derivative instruments is interest rate risk, exposure to changes in the fair value of debt attributable to interest rate risk and currency risk. From time to time, the Company enters into interest rate swap agreements or foreign currency contracts to manage exposure to these risks. Under these agreements, the Company is exposed to counterparty credit risk to the extent that a counterparty fails to meet the terms of a contract. The Company’s exposure is limited to the current value of the contract at the time the counterparty fails to perform. The Company assesses, both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows or fair values of hedged items. The Company does not hold derivatives for trading purposes. F-11 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) Fair Value Measurements —The Company determines the fair value of its financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Asset Retirement Obligations —When required, the Company recognizes the fair value of obligations to remove its tower assets and remediate the leased land upon which certain of its tower assets are located. Generally, the associated retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related tower assets and depreciated over their estimated useful lives and the liability is accreted through the obligation’s estimated settlement date. Fair value estimates of asset retirement obligations generally involve discounting of estimated future cash flows associated with takedown costs. Periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is included in Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Adjustments are also made to the asset retirement obligation liability to reflect changes in the estimates of timing and amount of expected cash flows, with an offsetting adjustment made to the related long-lived tangible asset. The significant assumptions used in estimating the Company’s aggregate asset retirement obligation are: timing of tower removals; cost of tower removals; timing and number of land lease renewals; expected inflation rates; and credit-adjusted, risk-free interest rates that approximate the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. Income Taxes —As a REIT, the Company generally is not subject to U.S. federal income taxes on income generated by its REIT operations as it receives a dividends paid deduction for distributions to stockholders that generally offsets its REIT income and gains. However, the Company remains obligated to pay U.S. federal income taxes on certain earnings and continues to be subject to taxation in its foreign jurisdictions. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements reflect provisions for federal, state, local and foreign income taxes. The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The Company measures deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company periodically reviews its deferred tax assets, and provides valuation allowances if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets. Valuation allowances would be reversed as a reduction to the provision for income taxes if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based on changes in facts and circumstances relevant to the assets’ recoverability. The Company classifies uncertain tax positions as non-current income tax liabilities in Other non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet, unless expected to be paid within one year. The Company reports penalties and tax-related interest expense as a component of the income tax provision and interest income from tax refunds as a component of Other expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) —Other comprehensive income (loss) refers to items excluded from net income that are recorded as an adjustment to equity, net of tax. The Company’s other comprehensive income (loss) primarily consisted of changes in fair value of effective derivative cash flow hedges, foreign currency translation adjustments and reclassification of unrealized losses on effective derivative cash flow hedges. The AOCL balance included accumulated foreign currency translation losses of $2.6 billion , $2.0 billion and $2.0 billion for the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Distributions —As a REIT, the Company must annually distribute to its stockholders an amount equal to at least 90% of its REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain). Generally, the Company has distributed, and expects to continue to distribute, all or substantially all of its REIT taxable income after taking into consideration its utilization of net operating losses (“NOLs”). The amount, timing and frequency of future distributions will be at the sole discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend upon various factors, a number of which may be beyond the Company’s control, including the Company’s financial condition and operating cash flows, the amount required to maintain its qualification for taxation as a REIT and reduce any income and excise taxes that the Company otherwise would be required to pay, limitations on distributions in the Company’s existing and future debt and preferred equity instruments, the Company’s ability to utilize NOLs to offset the Company’s distribution requirements, limitations on its ability to fund distributions using cash generated through its TRSs and other factors that the Board of Directors may deem relevant. F-12 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) Acquisitions —For acquisitions that meet the definition of a business combination, the Company applies the acquisition method of accounting where assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value at the date of each acquisition, and the results of operations are included with those of the Company from the dates of the respective acquisitions. Any excess of the purchase price paid by the Company over the amounts recognized for assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. The Company continues to evaluate acquisitions for a period not to exceed one year after the applicable acquisition date of each transaction to determine whether any additional adjustments are needed to the allocation of the purchase price paid for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. All other acquisitions are accounted for as asset acquisitions and the purchase price is allocated to the net assets acquired with no recognition of goodwill. The purchase price is not subsequently adjusted. The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is typically determined by using either estimates of replacement costs or discounted cash flow valuation methods. When determining the fair value of tangible assets acquired, the Company must estimate the cost to replace the asset with a new asset taking into consideration such factors as age, condition and the economic useful life of the asset. When determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the Company must estimate the applicable discount rate and the timing and amount of future cash flows, including rate and terms of renewal and attrition. Revenue —The Company’s revenue from leasing arrangements, including fixed escalation clauses present in non-cancellable lease arrangements, is reported on a straight-line basis over the term of the respective leases when collectibility is probable. Escalation clauses tied to the Consumer Price Index or other inflation-based indices, and other incentives present in lease agreements with the Company’s tenants are excluded from the straight-line calculation. Total property straight-line revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were $87.6 million , $194.4 million and $131.7 million , respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2018 the Company entered into agreements with one of its tenants in India, Tata Teleservices Limited (“Tata Teleservices”) and related entities (collectively, “Tata”), for a settlement and release of certain contractual lease obligations of Tata Teleservices for which the Company received a cash settlement payment of $345.5 million . The new revenue recognition accounting standard, which applies to revenue not recorded under the lease standard, requires entities to recognize revenue when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted the new revenue recognition standard using the modified retrospective method applied to contracts that were not completed as of January 1, 2018. Results for reporting periods beginning January 1, 2018 are presented under the new standard, while prior-period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with accounting under the previously applicable guidance. The Company recorded a net reduction to opening Distributions in excess of earnings in its consolidated balance sheet of $38.4 million as of January 1, 2018 due to the cumulative impact of adopting the new revenue recognition standard. The impact is primarily related to the Company’s site inspection revenue, which is now recognized at the point in time when the inspection service is completed. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the impact of applying the new standard was an increase to revenue of $4.9 million . The adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s revenue recognition patterns. Most of the Company’s revenue is derived from leasing arrangements and is accounted for as lease revenue. A small portion of the Company’s revenue is either derived from non-lease performance obligations within the lease arrangements or from other agreements with its tenants. This revenue, designated non-lease revenue, is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to the tenants in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Since most of the Company’s contracts are leases, costs to enter into lease arrangements are capitalized under the applicable lease accounting guidance. Costs incurred to obtain non-lease contracts that are capitalized primarily relate to DAS networks and are not material to the consolidated financial statements. The Company has excluded sales tax, value-added tax and similar taxes from non-lease revenue. Non-lease revenue is disaggregated by geography in a manner consistent with the Company’s business segments, which are discussed further in note 20. A summary of non-lease revenue disaggregated by source and geography is as follows: F-13 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) Year Ended December 31, 2018 U.S. Asia EMEA Latin America Total Power and fuel pass-through revenue $ — $ 450.0 $ 140.3 $ 16.8 $ 607.1 Other non-lease revenue 273.2 7.0 1.3 102.1 383.6 Total non-lease property revenue $ 273.2 $ 457.0 $ 141.6 $ 118.9 $ 990.7 Services revenue 125.4 — — — 125.4 Total non-lease revenue $ 398.6 $ 457.0 $ 141.6 $ 118.9 $ 1,116.1 Property lease revenue 3,548.9 1,083.5 545.7 1,145.9 6,324.0 Total revenue $ 3,947.5 $ 1,540.5 $ 687.3 $ 1,264.8 $ 7,440.1 Power and fuel pass-through revenue —Most of the Company’s leasing arrangements outside of the U.S. require that the Company provide power to the communications site through an electrical grid connection, diesel fuel generators or other sources and permit the Company to pass through the costs of, or otherwise charge for, these services. The Company recognizes revenue received in connection with such services as power and fuel pass-through revenue. Many arrangements require that the communications site has power for a specified percentage of time. In most such cases, if delivery of power falls below the specified service level, a corresponding reduction in revenue is recorded. The Company has determined that this performance obligation is satisfied over time for the duration of the arrangement. Other significant judgments related to this revenue stream are the (i) determination that the Company is a principal in these transactions and revenue is therefore recorded on a gross basis and (ii) service level related adjustments to revenue. Other non-lease revenue —Other non-lease revenue consists primarily of revenue generated from DAS networks, fiber and other property related revenue. DAS networks and fiber arrangements require that the Company provide the tenant the right to use the applicable communications infrastructure. Performance obligations are satisfied over time for the duration of the arrangements. Other property related revenue streams, which include site inspections, are not material on either an individual or consolidated basis. Services revenue —The Company offers tower-related services in the United States. These services include AZP and structural analysis. There is a single performance obligation related to AZP, and revenue is recognized over time based on milestones achieved, which are determined based on costs expected to be incurred. Structural analysis services may have more than one performance obligation, contingent upon the number of contracted services. Revenue is recognized at the point in time the services are completed. Some of the Company’s contracts with tenants contain multiple performance obligations. For these arrangements, the Company allocates revenue to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price, which is typically based on the price charged to tenants. Information about receivables, contract assets and contract liabilities from contracts with tenants is as follows: January 1, 2018 December 31, 2018 Accounts receivable $ 222.2 $ 260.7 Prepaids and other current assets 79.7 103.2 Notes receivable and other non-current assets 24.2 22.2 Unearned revenue 26.6 37.6 Other non-current liabilities 68.5 54.9 The Company records unearned revenue when payments are received from tenants in advance of the completion of the Company’s performance obligations. Long-term unearned revenue is included in Other non-current liabilities. The increase in the Unearned revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 is due to payments received, offset by $79.5 million of revenue recognized during the year ended December 31, 2018, that was included in the Unearned revenue balance as of January 1, 2018. There was $0.5 million of revenue recognized from Other non-current liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2018. F-14 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) The Company records unbilled receivables, which are included in Prepaids and other current assets, when it has completed a performance obligation prior to its ability to bill under the customer arrangement. Other contract assets are included in Notes receivable and other non-current assets. The decrease in unbilled receivables attributable to revenue recognized during the year ended December 31, 2018 was $1.0 million . The change in contract assets attributable to revenue recognized during the year ended December 31, 2018 was $0.4 million . The Company does not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for agreements (i) with an original expected length of one year or less or (ii) for which it recognizes revenue at the amount to which it has the right to invoice for services performed. Rent Expense —Many of the leases underlying the Company’s tower sites have fixed rent escalations, which provide for periodic increases in the amount of ground rent payable by the Company over time. In addition, certain of the Company’s tenant leases require the Company to exercise available renewal options pursuant to the underlying ground lease if the tenant exercises its renewal option. The Company calculates straight-line ground rent expense for these leases based on the fixed non-cancellable term of the underlying ground lease plus all periods, if any, for which failure to renew the lease imposes an economic penalty to the Company such that renewal appears to be reasonably assured. Total property straight-line ground rent expense for the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 was $57.9 million , $62.3 million and $67.8 million , respectively. The Company records a liability for straight-line ground rent expense in Other non-current liabilities. The Company records prepaid ground rent in Prepaid and other current assets and Notes receivable and other non-current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets according to the anticipated period of benefit. Selling, General, Administrative and Development Expense —Selling, general and administrative expense consists of overhead expenses related to the Company’s property and services operations and corporate overhead costs not specifically allocable to any of the Company’s individual business operations. Development expense consists of costs related to the Company’s acquisition efforts, costs associated with new business initiatives and project cancellation costs. Stock-Based Compensation —Stock-based compensation expense is measured at the accounting measurement date based on the fair value of the award and is generally recognized as an expense over the service period, which typically represents the vesting period. The Company provides for accelerated vesting and extended exercise periods of stock options and restricted stock units upon an employee’s death or permanent disability, or upon an employee’s qualified retirement, provided certain eligibility criteria are met. Accordingly, the Company recognizes compensation expense for stock options and time-based restricted stock units (“RSUs”) over the shorter of (i) the four -year vesting period or (ii) the period from the date of grant to the date the employee becomes eligible for such retirement benefits, which may occur upon grant. The expense recognized includes the impact of forfeitures as they occur. The Company grants performance-based restricted stock units (“PSUs”) to its executive officers. Threshold, target and maximum parameters are established for a three -year performance period at the time of grant. The metrics are used to calculate the number of shares that will be issuable when the awards vest, which may range from zero to 200% of the target amounts. The Company recognizes compensation expense for PSUs over the three -year vesting period, subject to adjustment based on the date the employee becomes eligible for retirement benefits as well as performance relative to grant parameters. The fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and the fair value of RSUs and PSUs is based on the fair value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. The Company recognizes all stock-based compensation expense in either Selling, general, administrative and development expense, costs of operations or as part of the costs associated with the construction of the tower assets. In connection with the vesting of restricted stock units, the Company withholds from issuance a number of shares of common stock to satisfy certain employee tax withholding obligations arising from such vesting. The shares withheld are considered constructively retired. The Company recognizes the fair value of the shares withheld in Additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2018, the Company has withheld from issuance an aggregate of 1.7 million shares, including 0.3 million shares related to the vesting of restricted stock units during the year ended December 31, 2018. Litigation Costs —The Company periodically becomes involved in various claims and lawsuits that are incidental to its business. The Company regularly monitors the status of pending legal actions to evaluate both the magnitude and likelihood of any potential loss. The Company accrues for these potential losses when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss, or possible range of loss, can be reasonably estimated. Should the ultimate losses on contingencies or litigation vary from estimates, adjustments to those liabilities may be required. The Company also incurs legal costs in connection with F-15 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) these matters and records estimates of these expenses, which are reflected in Selling, general, administrative and development expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Earnings Per Common Share — Basic and Diluted —Basic net income per common share represents net income attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per common share represents net income attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period and any dilutive common share equivalents, including (A) shares issuable upon (i) the vesting of RSUs, (ii) exercise of stock options, and (iii) conversion of the Company’s mandatory convertible preferred stock and (B) shares expected to be earned upon the achievement of the parameters established for PSUs, each to the extent not anti-dilutive. Dilutive common share equivalents also include the dilutive impact of the shares issuable in the Alltel transaction, which is described in note 18. The Company uses the treasury stock method to calculate the effect of its outstanding RSUs, PSUs and stock options and uses the if-converted method to calculate the effect of its outstanding mandatory convertible preferred stock. Retirement Plan —The Company has a 401(k) plan covering substantially all employees who meet certain age and employment requirements. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company matched 100% of the first 5% of a participant's contributions. For the year ended December 31, 2016 , the Company matched 75% of the first 6% of a participant’s contributions. For the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , the Company contributed $11.2 million , $11.0 million and $9.1 million to the plan, respectively. Accounting Standards Updates Lease Accounting —In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued guidance on the accounting for leases. The guidance amends the existing accounting standards for lease accounting, including the requirement that lessees recognize right of use assets and lease liabilities for leases with terms greater than twelve months in the statement of financial position. Under the new guidance, lessor accounting is largely unchanged. In January 2018, the FASB issued guidance on the treatment of land easements. The guidance provides a practical expedient to not evaluate existing or expired land easements under the new lease accounting standards if those easements were not previously accounted for as leases under the existing lease guidance. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on its financial statements or its adoption of the lease accounting guidance. In July 2018, the FASB issued additional guidance on the accounting for leases. The guidance provides companies with another transition method by allowing entities to recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of the date of adoption. Under this method, previously presented years’ financial positions and results would not be adjusted. The new guidance also provides lessors with a practical expedient, by class of underlying asset, to not separate non-lease components from the associated lease component if the non-lease components would otherwise be accounted for under the new revenue recognition standard and both the timing and pattern of transfer are the same for the non-lease components and associated lease component and, if accounted for separately, the lease component would be classified as an operating lease. In December 2018, the FASB issued additional guidance with narrow-scope improvements for lessors. The guidance permits lessors, as an accounting policy election, to exclude sales and related taxes from the evaluation of lessor costs, requires lessors to exclude from revenue and expense lessor costs paid directly to a third party by lessees and clarifies the lessors’ accounting for variable payments related to both lease and non-lease components. The lease accounting guidance is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company plans to adopt the standard using the modified retrospective method applied to lease arrangements that were in place on the transition date. Results for reporting periods beginning January 1, 2019 will be presented under the new standard, while prior-period amounts will not be adjusted and will continue to be reported in accordance with accounting under the previously applicable guidance. The Company will elect certain available practical expedients that permit the adopter to not reassess certain items upon adoption, including: (i) whether any existing contracts are or contain leases, (ii) the classification of existing leases and (iii) initial directs costs for existing leases. As a result, the vast majority of the Company’s ground leases will continue to be accounted for as operating leases under the standard and have recognition patterns similar to those under prior guidance. The F-16 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) Company will also elect the practical expedient related to land easements, which permits carryforward accounting treatment of capitalizing long-term easements that have a specified term. The Company will elect to not separate non-lease components from the related lease components and will account for the components together as a single lease component on the transition date. The Company estimates adoption of the standard will result in recognition of operating lease right of use assets and operating lease liabilities of approximately $7.1 billion and $6.8 billion , respectively, as of January 1, 2019. The right of use assets recorded include, among other items, amounts previously classified as prepaid rent, deferred lease acquisition costs and long-term deferred rent obligations. The Company also expects to record approximately $24.7 million as an adjustment to retained earnings related to right of use assets assets recorded on previously impaired sites. The Company’s capital lease assets, which are disclosed in note 3, and liabilities, which are disclosed in note 8, remain largely unchanged under the lease accounting standard. Although adoption of the standard will require the Company to provide additional disclosures in the financial statements and notes, the Company does not expect the standard will have a material impact on its results of operations or liquidity. The Company does not expect the guidance to have a material impact on its debt covenant compliance. Other Updates —In January 2017, the FASB issued guidance on accounting for goodwill impairments. The guidance eliminates Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test and requires, among other things, recognition of an impairment loss when the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. The loss recognized is limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements. In August 2017, the FASB issued guidance on hedge and derivative accounting. The guidance simplifies accounting rules around hedge accounting and the disclosures of hedging arrangements. Among other things, the guidance eliminates the need to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness and generally requires the entire change in fair value of a hedging instrument to be presented in the same income statement line as the hedged item. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company early adopted this guidance during the fourth quarter of 2018. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements. In February 2018, the FASB issued new guidance on the treatment of tax effects that are presented in other comprehensive income. The guidance allows a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects as a result of the December 2017 legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued guidance on fair value measurements. The guidance modifies the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements and is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The Company early adopted this guidance during the fourth quarter of 2018. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements. Other Disclosure Requirement Updates In August 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued a final rule that amends certain of its disclosure requirements. Among other amendments, the final rule extends to interim periods the annual disclosure requirement of presenting changes in stockholders’ equity and the amount of dividends per share for each class of shares and deletes the provisions of the rules that require the presentation of dividends per share on the face of the income statement for interim periods, moving the required disclosure to the analysis of changes in stockholders’ equity. The final rule was effective as of November 5, 2018. The adoption of these disclosure requirements did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements. F-17 2.

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS The changes in the carrying value of goodwill for the Company’s business segments were as follows: Property Services Total U.S. Asia EMEA Latin America Balance as of January 1, 2017 $ 3,379.2 $ 1,029.3 $ 150.5 $ 509.7 $ 2.0 $ 5,070.7 Additions (1) — 0.4 220.9 264.8 — 486.1 Effect of foreign currency translation — 65.3 33.5 (17.2 ) — 81.6 Balance as of January 1, 2018 $ 3,379.2 $ 1,095.0 $ 404.9 $ 757.3 $ 2.0 $ 5,638.4 Additions (2) 3.3 44.5 — 0.4 — 48.2 Effect of foreign currency translation — (94.0 ) (23.6 ) (67.1 ) — (184.7 ) Balance as of December 31, 2018 $ 3,382.5 $ 1,045.5 $ 381.3 $ 690.6 $ 2.0 $ 5,501.9 _______________ (1) Additions consist of $485.1 million resulting from 2017 acquisitions and $1.0 million from revisions to prior-year acquisitions due to measurement period adjustments. (2) Additions consist of $47.8 million resulting from 2018 acquisitions and $0.4 million from revisions to prior-year acquisitions due to measurement period adjustments. F-18 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) The Company’s other intangible assets subject to amortization consisted of the following: As of December 31, 2018 As of December 31, 2017 Estimated Useful Lives Gross Carrying Value Accumulated Amortization Net Book Value Gross Carrying Value Accumulated Amortization Net Book Value (years) Acquired network location intangibles (1) Up to 20 $ 4,780.3 $ (1,704.9 ) $ 3,075.4 $ 4,858.8 $ (1,525.3 ) $ 3,333.5 Acquired tenant-related intangibles 15-20 11,156.5 (3,147.2 ) 8,009.3 11,150.9 (2,754.7 ) 8,396.2 Acquired licenses and other intangibles 3-20 104.1 (14.5 ) 89.6 58.8 (8.1 ) 50.7 Economic Rights, TV Azteca (2) 70 — — — 14.5 (11.6 ) 2.9 Total other intangible assets $ 16,040.9 $ (4,866.6 ) $ 11,174.3 $ 16,083.0 $ (4,299.7 ) $ 11,783.3 _______________ (1) Acquired network location intangibles are amortized over the shorter of the term of the corresponding ground lease taking into consideration lease renewal options and residual value or up to 20 years, as the Company considers these intangibles to be directly related to the tower assets. (2) As discussed in note 5, in conjunction with the extinguishment of a note from TV Azteca (as defined in note 5), the Company restructured the Economic Rights Agreement (as defined in note 5) and wrote off the corresponding asset. The intangible asset related to the Commercialization Rights (as defined in note 5) agreement with TV Azteca is included in Acquired licenses and other intangibles. The acquired network location intangibles represent the value to the Company of the incremental revenue growth that could potentially be obtained from leasing the excess capacity on acquired communications sites. The acquired tenant-related intangibles typically represent the value to the Company of tenant contracts and relationships in place at the time of an acquisition or similar transaction, including assumptions regarding estimated renewals. The Company amortizes its acquired network location intangibles and tenant-related intangibles on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives. As of December 31, 2018 , the remaining weighted average amortization period of the Company’s intangible assets was 15 years. Amortization of intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 was $1,144.1 million , $785.9 million and $699.8 million , respectively. Amortization expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2018 because the Company entered into agreements with Tata for a settlement and release of certain contractual lease obligations of Tata Teleservices. As a result, the Company recorded $327.5 million of accelerated amortization related to the Tata tenant relationship, which was subsequently retired. Based on current exchange rates, the Company expects to record amortization expense as follows over the next five years: Year Ending December 31, 2019 $ 786.0 2020 765.8 2021 749.6 2022 745.1 2023 740.6 5. NOTES RECEIVABLE AND OTHER NON-CURRENT ASSETS Notes receivable and other non-current assets consisted of the following as of December 31,: 2018 2017 Long-term prepaid ground rent $ 607.5 $ 552.8 Notes receivable 1.0 83.7 Other miscellaneous assets 354.1 313.6 Notes receivable and other non-current assets $ 962.6 $ 950.1 F-19 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) TV Azteca Note Receivable —In 2000, the Company loaned TV Azteca, S.A. de C.V. (“TV Azteca”), the owner of a major national television network in Mexico, $119.8 million . The loan had an interest rate of 13.11% , payable quarterly, which at the time of issuance was determined to be below market and therefore a corresponding discount was recorded. The term of the loan was 70 years . The Company amortized the discount on the loan to Interest income, TV Azteca, net of interest expense on its consolidated statements of operations using the effective interest method over the term of the loan. As of December 31, 2017, the outstanding balance on the loan was $91.8 million , or $82.9 million , net of discount. On September 25, 2018, TV Azteca paid $59.5 million to extinguish this loan and simultaneously restructured its Economic Rights agreement, which the Company estimated had a fair value of $24.8 million . TV Azteca Economic Rights and Commercialization Rights —Simultaneous with the signing of the loan agreement in 2000, the Company also entered into a 70 -year Economic Rights Agreement with TV Azteca regarding space not used by TV Azteca on approximately 190 of its broadcast towers. In exchange for the issuance of the below market interest rate loan described above and the annual payment of $1.5 million to TV Azteca (under the Economic Rights Agreement), the Company had the right to market and lease the unused tower space on the broadcast towers (the “Economic Rights”). TV Azteca retained title to these towers and was responsible for their operation and maintenance. The Company was entitled to 100% of the revenues generated from leases with tenants on the unused space and was responsible for any incremental operating expenses associated with those tenants. The Company accounted for the annual payment of $1.5 million as a capital lease by initially recording an asset and a corresponding liability of $18.6 million . The capital lease asset also included the original discount on the note. The capital lease asset and original discount on the note aggregated $30.2 million at the time of the transaction and represented the cost to acquire the Economic Rights. The Economic Rights asset was recorded as an intangible asset and was being amortized over the 70 -year life of the Economic Rights Agreement. In conjunction with the note extinguishment described above, the Company restructured the Economic Rights Agreement into a Commercialization Rights agreement. Under this agreement, the Company has the exclusive right to commercialize available space on approximately 190 TV Azteca broadcast towers for the installation, licensing and operation of equipment for wireless telecommunications service, radio and television broadcasting on the towers (the “Commercialization Rights”) until September 2038, during which time the Company is entitled to all revenues derived from the Commercialization Rights. Subsequent to 2038, the Company is required to pay quarterly to TV Azteca a market rate of 25% of the gross revenues associated with the Commercialization Rights, and annually, TV Azteca has the right to repurchase the Commercialization Rights for the then-market price. As a result of entering into the Commercialization Rights agreement, the obligations under the capital lease were cancelled and the remaining capital lease liability of $14.1 million , the deferred financing costs of $1.5 million , and the net carrying value of the original Economic Rights asset of $3.0 million were written off, which resulted in a gain of $9.7 million that was recorded in Other income (expense). 6. ACQUISITIONS The Company evaluates each of its acquisitions under the accounting guidance framework to determine whether to treat an acquisition as an asset acquisition or a business combination. For those transactions treated as asset acquisitions, the purchase price is allocated to the assets or rights acquired and liabilities assumed, with no recognition of goodwill. For those transactions treated as business combinations, the estimates of the fair value of the assets or rights acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of the applicable acquisition are subject to adjustment during the measurement period (up to one year from the particular acquisition date). The primary areas of the accounting for the acquisitions that are not yet finalized relate to the fair value of certain tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which may include contingent consideration, residual goodwill and any related tax impact. F-20 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) The fair value of these net assets acquired are based on management’s estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. While the Company believes that such preliminary estimates provide a reasonable basis for estimating the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, it evaluates any necessary information prior to finalization of the fair value. During the measurement period for those acquisitions accounted for as business combinations, the Company will adjust assets or liabilities if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have resulted in the revised estimated values of those assets or liabilities as of that date. Impact of current year acquisitions —The Company typically acquires communications sites from wireless carriers or other tower operators and subsequently integrates those sites into its existing portfolio of communications sites. The financial results of the Company’s acquisitions have been included in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 from the date of the respective acquisition. The date of acquisition, and by extension the point at which the Company begins to recognize the results of an acquisition, may depend on, among other things, the receipt of contractual consents, the commencement and extent of leasing arrangements and the timing of the transfer of title or rights to the assets, which may be accomplished in phases. Sites acquired from communications service providers may never have been operated as a business and may instead have been utilized solely by the seller as a component of its network infrastructure. An acquisition may or may not involve the transfer of business operations or employees. For those acquisitions accounted for as business combinations, the Company recognizes acquisition and merger related expenses in the period in which they are incurred and services are received; for transactions accounted for as asset acquisitions, these costs are capitalized as part of the purchase price. Acquisition and merger related costs may include finder’s fees, advisory, legal, accounting, valuation and other professional or consulting fees and general administrative costs directly related to the transaction. Integration costs include incremental and non-recurring costs necessary to convert data, retain employees and otherwise enable the Company to operate acquired businesses or assets efficiently. The Company records acquisition and merger related expenses for business combinations, as well as integration costs for all acquisitions, in Other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. During the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , the Company recorded the following acquisition and merger related expenses for business combinations and integration costs: Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 Acquisition and merger related expenses $ 14.1 $ 16.3 $ 15.9 Integration costs $ 16.1 $ 11.5 $ 9.9 The Company also recorded aggregate purchase price refunds of $22.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. The refunds primarily related to an acquisition in Brazil in 2014 for which the measurement period has closed. 2018 Transactions The estimated aggregate impact of the 2018 acquisitions on the Company’s revenues and gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2018 was approximately $232.2 million and $83.0 million , respectively. The revenues and gross margin amounts also reflect incremental revenues from the addition of new tenants to such sites subsequent to the transaction date. Idea Acquisition— On May 31, 2018, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of Idea Cellular Infrastructure Services Limited (“Idea”), a telecommunications company that owns and operates approximately 9,700 communications sites in India, for total consideration of approximately 42.8 billion Indian Rupees (“INR”) ( $635.5 million at the date of acquisition). This acquisition was accounted for as a business combination and is subject to post-closing adjustments. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the purchase price was reduced to approximately 42.2 billion INR ( $625.9 million at the date of acquisition). Vodafone Acquisition— On March 31, 2018, the Company acquired approximately 10,200 communications sites from Vodafone India Limited and Vodafone Mobile Services Limited (together, “Vodafone”) for an aggregate total purchase price of 38.3 billion INR ( $587.9 million at the date of acquisition). Of the aggregate purchase price, $1.1 million is reflected in Accounts payable in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2018. This acquisition was accounted for as an asset acquisition. F-21 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) Kenya Acquisition— On October 1, 2018, the Company acquired over 700 sites in Kenya from Telkom Kenya Limited for total consideration of $174.1 million , including value added tax. The Company issued a note for $51.8 million of the purchase price, which will be paid either in future installments subject to the satisfaction of specified conditions, or three years from the purchase date. This acquisition was accounted for as an asset acquisition. Other Acquisitions— During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company acquired a total of 1,335 communications sites in the United States, Colombia, Mexico, Paraguay and Peru for an aggregate purchase price of $414.5 million . Of the aggregate purchase price, $11.8 million is reflected as a payable in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2018. The majority of these acquisitions were accounted for as asset acquisitions. On November 1, 2018, the Company acquired a portfolio of fiber assets and the right to use certain telecommunications poles in Brazil from Cia Energetica de Minas Gerais SA for total consideration of approximately 576.9 million Brazilian Reais (“BRL”) ( $155.8 million at the date of acquisition). This acquisition is included in “Other” in the table below and was accounted for as an asset acquisition.

If the DSCR were equal to or below 1.30 x (the “Cash Trap DSCR”) for any quarter, then all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments, fund required reserves, pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and make other payments required under the applicable transaction documents, referred to as excess cash flow, will be deposited into a reserve account (the “Cash Trap Reserve Account”) instead of being released to the AMT Asset Subs or GTP Acquisition Partners, as applicable. The funds in the Cash Trap Reserve Account will not be released to the AMT Asset Subs or GTP Acquisition Partners, as applicable, unless the DSCR exceeds the Cash Trap DSCR for two consecutive calendar quarters. Additionally, an “amortization period” commences if, as of the end of any calendar quarter, the DSCR is equal to or below 1.15 x (the “Minimum DSCR”) and will continue to exist until the DSCR exceeds the Minimum DSCR for two consecutive calendar quarters. With respect to the Trust Securities, an “amortization period” also commences if, on the anticipated repayment date the component of the Loan corresponding to the applicable subclass of the Trust Securities has not been repaid in full, provided that such amortization period shall apply with respect to such component that has not been repaid in full. If either series of the 2015 Notes have not been repaid in full on the applicable anticipated repayment date, additional interest will accrue on the unpaid principal balance of the applicable series of the 2015 Notes, and such series will begin to amortize on a monthly basis from excess cash flow. During an amortization period, all excess cash flow and any amounts in the applicable Cash Trap Reserve Account would be applied to pay the principal of the Loan or the 2015 Notes, as applicable, on each monthly payment date. The Loan and the 2015 Notes may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time, provided such payment is accompanied by the applicable prepayment consideration. If the prepayment occurs within 12 months of the anticipated repayment date with respect to the Series 2015-1 Notes, 18 months of the anticipated repayment date with respect to the Series 2013-2A Securities or the Series 2015-2 Notes, or 36 months of the anticipated repayment date with respect to the Series 2018 Securities, no prepayment consideration is due. The Loan Agreement and the 2015 Indenture include operating covenants and other restrictions customary for transactions subject to rated securitizations. Among other things, the AMT Asset Subs and the GTP Entities, as applicable, are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets subject to customary carve-outs for ordinary course trade payables and permitted encumbrances (as defined in the Loan Agreement or the 2015 Indenture, as applicable). The organizational documents of the AMT Asset Subs and the GTP Entities contain provisions consistent with rating agency securitization criteria for special purpose entities, including the requirement that they maintain independent directors. The Loan Agreement and the 2015 Indenture also contain certain covenants that require the AMT Asset Subs or GTP Acquisition Partners, as applicable, to provide the respective trustee with regular financial reports and operating budgets, promptly notify such trustee F-30 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) of events of default and material breaches under the Loan Agreement and other agreements related to the Trust Sites or the 2015 Indenture and other agreements related to the 2015 Secured Sites, as applicable, and allow the applicable trustee reasonable access to the sites, including the right to conduct site investigations. A failure to comply with the covenants in the Loan Agreement or the 2015 Indenture could prevent the AMT Asset Subs or GTP Acquisition Partners, as applicable, from distributing excess cash flow to the Company. Furthermore, if the AMT Asset Subs or GTP Acquisition Partners were to default on the Loan or a series of the 2015 Notes, the applicable trustee may seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of all or any portion of the Trust Sites or the 2015 Secured Sites, respectively, in which case the Company could lose the revenue associated with those assets. With respect to the 2015 Notes, upon the occurrence and during an event of default, the applicable trustee may, in its discretion or at the direction of holders of more than 50% of the aggregate outstanding principal of any series of the 2015 Notes, declare such series of 2015 Notes immediately due and payable, in which case any excess cash flow would need to be used to pay holders of such notes. Further, under the Loan Agreement and the 2015 Indenture, the AMT Asset Subs or GTP Acquisition Partners, respectively, are required to maintain reserve accounts, including for ground rents, real estate and personal property taxes and insurance premiums, and, under the 2015 Indenture and in certain circumstances under the Loan Agreement, to reserve a portion of advance rents from tenants on the Trust Sites. Based on the terms of the Loan Agreement and the 2015 Indenture, all rental cash receipts received for each month are reserved for the succeeding month and held in an account controlled by the applicable trustee and then released. The $63.3 million held in the reserve accounts with respect to the Trust Securitizations and the $16.8 million held in the reserve accounts with respect to the 2015 Securitization as of December 31, 2018 are classified as Restricted cash on the Company’s accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Interest rates on the term loans are fixed until certain reset dates. Generally, the term loans can be repaid without penalty on the reset dates; repayments at dates other than the reset dates are subject to prepayment penalties, typically of 1% to 2% . Scheduled repayment terms include either ratable or staggered amortization with repayments typically commencing between 6 and 36 months after the initial disbursement of funds. The India indebtedness also includes several working capital facilities, most of which are subject to annual renewal, and which are generally secured by the borrower’s short-term and long-term assets. The working capital facilities bear interest at rates that consist of the applicable bank’s Marginal Cost of Funds based Lending Rate (as defined in the applicable agreement), plus a spread.

The South African Credit Facility may be prepaid in whole or in part without prepayment consideration. The Colombian Credit Facility may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time, subject to certain limitations and prepayment consideration. The South African Credit Facility, the Colombian Credit Facility and the Brazil Credit Facility are secured by, among other things, liens on towers owned by the applicable borrower. Each of the agreements governing the other subsidiary debt contains contractual covenants and other restrictions. Failure to comply with certain of the financial and operating covenants could constitute a default under the applicable debt agreement, which could result in, among other things, the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable. Shareholder Loans —In connection with the establishment of certain of the Company’s joint ventures and related acquisitions of communications sites in Ghana and Uganda, the Company’s majority owned subsidiaries entered into shareholder loan agreements, as borrowers, with wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company and of the Company’s joint venture partners, as lenders. The portions of the loans made by the Company’s wholly owned subsidiaries are eliminated in consolidation and the portions of the loans made by each of the Company’s joint venture partner’s wholly owned subsidiaries are reported as outstanding debt of the Company. Outstanding amounts under each of the Company’s shareholder loans consisted of the following as of December 31, : 2018 2017 Contractual Interest Rate Maturity Date Ghana loan (1) $ 59.9 $ 66.5 21.87 % December 31, 2019 Uganda loan (2) $ — 34.1 N/A N/A F-32 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) _______________ (1) Denominated in GHS.

F-33 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) 11. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS The Company determines the fair value of its financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Below are the three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date. Level 2 Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Items Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis —The fair value of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities that are required to be measured on a recurring basis at fair value was as follows: December 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 Fair Value Measurements Using Fair Value Measurements Using Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Assets: Short-term investments (1) $ — — — $ 1.0 — — Embedded derivative in lease agreement — — $ 11.5 — — $ 12.4 Liabilities: Interest rate swap agreements — $ 33.8 — — $ 29.0 — Acquisition-related contingent consideration — — $ 0.9 — — $ 10.1 Fair value of debt related to interest rate swap agreements $ (31.3 ) — — $ (24.5 ) — — Redeemable noncontrolling interests — — $ 1,004.8 — — $ 1,126.2 _______________ (1) Consists of highly liquid investments with original maturities in excess of three months. Interest Rate Swap Agreements The fair value of the Company’s interest rate swap agreements is determined using pricing models with inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, changes in the value of the derivatives are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in the current period, along with the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the Company records the change in fair value for the effective portion of the cash flow hedges in AOCL in the consolidated balance sheets and reclassifies a portion of the value from AOCL into Interest expense on a quarterly basis as the cash flows from the hedged item affects earnings. The Company records the settlement of interest rate swap agreements in (Loss) gain on retirement of long-term obligations in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the settlement occurs. The Company entered into three interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional value of $500.0 million related to the 3.000% senior unsecured notes due 2021 (the “ 3.000% Notes”). These interest rate swaps, which were designated as fair value hedges at inception, were entered into to hedge against changes in fair value of the 3.000% Notes resulting from changes in interest rates. The interest rate swap agreements require the Company to pay interest at a variable interest rate of one-month LIBOR plus applicable spreads and to receive fixed interest at a rate of 3.000% through June 15, 2023. F-34 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) The Company entered into three interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional value of $600.0 million related to the 2.250% senior unsecured notes due 2022 (the “ 2.250% Notes”). These interest rate swaps, which were designated as fair value hedges at inception, were entered into to hedge against changes in fair value of the 2.250% Notes resulting from changes in interest rates. The interest rate swap agreements require the Company to pay interest at a variable interest rate of one-month LIBOR plus applicable spreads and to receive fixed interest at a rate of 2.250% through January 15, 2022. The fair value of the interest rate swap agreements in the U.S. at December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $33.5 million and $28.5 million , respectively, and were included in Other non-current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recorded net fair value adjustments of $1.7 million related to interest rate swaps and the change in fair value of debt due to interest rate swaps in Other expense in the consolidated statement of operations. One of the Company’s Colombian subsidiaries is party to an interest rate swap agreement with an aggregate notional value of 55.0 billion COP ( $16.9 million ) with certain of the lenders under the Colombian Credit Facility. The interest rate swap agreement, which was designated as a cash flow hedge at inception, was entered into to manage exposure to variability in interest rates on debt. The interest rate swap agreement requires the payment of a fixed interest rate of 5.74% and pays variable interest at the three-month Inter-bank Rate (IBR) through the earlier of termination of the underlying debt or April 24, 2021. The notional value is reduced in accordance with the repayment schedule under the Colombian Credit Facility. The fair value of the interest rate swap agreements in Colombia at December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $0.3 million and $0.5 million , respectively, and were included in Other non-current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Embedded Derivative in Lease Agreement In connection with the acquisition of communications sites in Nigeria, the Company entered into a site lease agreement where a portion of the monthly rent to be received is escalated based on an index outside the lessor’s economic environment. The fair value of the portion of the lease tied to the U.S. consumer price index was $14.6 million at the date of acquisition and was recorded in Notes receivable and other non-current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the Company’s embedded derivative is determined using a discounted cash flow approach, which takes into consideration Level 3 unobservable inputs, including expected future cash flows over the period in which the associated payment is expected to be received and applies a discount factor that captures uncertainties in the future periods associated with the expected payment. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recorded $0.9 million of fair value adjustments, which were recorded in Other expense in the consolidated statement of operations. Acquisition-Related Contingent Consideration Acquisition-related contingent consideration is initially measured and recorded at fair value as an element of consideration paid in connection with an acquisition with subsequent adjustments recognized in Other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. The fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration, and any subsequent changes in fair value, is determined by using a discounted probability-weighted approach, which takes into consideration Level 3 unobservable inputs, including assessments of expected future cash flows over the period in which the obligation is expected to be settled, and applies a discount factor that captures the uncertainties associated with the obligation. Changes in the unobservable inputs of Level 3 assets or liabilities could significantly impact the fair value of these assets or liabilities recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, with the adjustments being recorded in the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2018 , the Company estimates that the value of all potential acquisition-related contingent consideration required payments to be between $0.0 million and $0.9 million . The changes in fair value of the contingent consideration were as follows during the years ended December 31,: 2018 2017 Balance as of January 1 $ 10.1 $ 15.4 Additions — — Settlements (8.7 ) — Change in fair value (0.9 ) (6.3 ) Foreign currency translation adjustment 0.4 1.0 Balance as of December 31 $ 0.9 $ 10.1 F-35 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests The Company records the carrying amount of the redeemable noncontrolling interests as described in note 14. The fair value of redeemable noncontrolling interests is determined using a discounted cash flow approach, which takes into consideration Level 3 unobservable inputs, including expected future cash flows and applies a discount factor that captures uncertainties in the future periods. If required, the Company adjusts the redeemable noncontrolling interests to redemption value on each balance sheet date with changes in redemption value recognized as an adjustment to net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests. The recurring Level 3 fair value measurements of the Company’s embedded derivative in lease agreement, acquisition-related contingent consideration and redeemable noncontrolling interests include the following significant unobservable inputs as of December 31, 2018: Significant Unobservable Input Range Embedded derivative in lease agreement Discount rate 10.93% - 13.96% Acquisition-related contingent consideration Probability of payout 0.00% - 100.00% Redeemable noncontrolling interests Revenue growth 3.16% - 12.87% Long-term growth rate 4.00 % Items Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis Assets Held and Used —The Company’s long-lived assets are recorded at amortized cost and, if impaired, are adjusted to fair value using Level 3 inputs. During the year ended December 31, 2018 , certain long-lived assets held and used with a carrying value of $22.4 billion were written down to their net realizable value as a result of an asset impairment charge of $ 394.0 million . During the year ended December 31, 2017 , certain long-lived assets held and used with a carrying value of $21.7 billion were written down to their net realizable value as a result of an asset impairment charge of $211.4 million . The asset impairment charges are recorded in Other operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. These adjustments were determined by comparing the estimated fair value utilizing projected future discounted cash flows to be provided from the long-lived assets to the asset’s carrying value. There were no other items measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during the year ended December 31, 2018 . Fair Value of Financial Instruments —The Company’s financial instruments for which the carrying value reasonably approximates fair value at December 31, 2018 and 2017 include cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable and accounts payable. The Company’s estimates of fair value of its long-term obligations, including the current portion, are based primarily upon reported market values. For long-term debt not actively traded, fair value is estimated using either indicative price quotes or a discounted cash flow analysis using rates for debt with similar terms and maturities. As of December 31, 2018 , the carrying value and fair value of long-term obligations, including the current portion, were $21.2 billion and $21.1 billion , respectively, of which $13.4 billion was measured using Level 1 inputs and $7.7 billion was measured using Level 2 inputs. As of December 31, 2017 , the carrying value and fair value of long-term obligations, including the current portion, were $20.2 billion and $20.6 billion , respectively, of which $13.3 billion was measured using Level 1 inputs and $7.3 billion was measured using Level 2 inputs. 12. INCOME TAXES Beginning in the taxable year ended December 31, 2012, the Company has filed, and intends to continue to file, U.S. federal income tax returns as a REIT, and its domestic TRSs filed, and intend to continue to file, separate tax returns as required. The Company also files tax returns in various states and countries. The Company’s state tax returns reflect different combinations of the Company’s subsidiaries and are dependent on the connection each subsidiary has with a particular state and form of organization. The following information pertains to the Company’s income taxes on a consolidated basis. F-36 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) The income tax provision from continuing operations consisted of the following for the years ended December 31,: 2018 2017 2016 Current: Federal $ (1.4 ) $ (0.1 ) $ (26.5 ) State (1.8 ) (3.8 ) (2.0 ) Foreign (189.7 ) (113.4 ) (100.1 ) Deferred: Federal 4.0 0.2 (0.6 ) State 0.7 1.0 (0.3 ) Foreign 298.3 85.4 (26.0 ) Income tax benefit (provision) $ 110.1 $ (30.7 ) $ (155.5 ) The effective tax rate (“ETR”) on income from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the Company’s qualification for taxation as a REIT, as well as adjustments for state and foreign items. As a REIT, the Company may deduct earnings distributed to stockholders against the income generated by its REIT operations. In addition, the Company is able to offset certain income by utilizing its NOLs, subject to specified limitations. The Tax Act significantly changed how the U.S. taxes corporations. The Tax Act contained several key provisions including, among other things, a reduction in the corporate income rate from 35% to 21% for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. As a result of this change in tax rate, the rate at which the Company’s deferred tax assets of the Company’s TRSs decreased, resulting in additional tax expense of $2.4 million , which did not significantly impact the Company's effective tax rate. As of December 31, 2017, the analysis of the full impact of the Tax Act on the Company was considered provisional and subject to further analysis. As of December 31, 2018 the Company has completed its analysis and all amounts are considered final. There were no material changes to the provisional impact. In 2015, there was an income tax law change in Ghana that disallowed unused capital allowances to be carried into 2016, which resulted in a charge to income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2015. In 2017, the Ghana Revenue Authority issued Practice Note Number DT/2016/010 (the “Practice Note”), which clarified the Capital Allowance section of the Income Tax Act of 2015. The Practice Note allowed for unused Capital Allowance from 2015 to be treated as a deduction in 2016. As a result, the Company recorded a tax benefit of $17.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The change in the income tax (benefit) provision for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily attributable to receipt of the payment associated with the Tata settlement and the deferred benefit resulting from impairment charges and accelerated amortization taken in the same foreign jurisdiction. The net impact from restructuring was primarily due to a benefit of $85.7 million which resulted from the restructuring of foreign operations in certain jurisdictions. Reconciliation between the U.S. statutory rate and the effective rate from continuing operations is as follows for the years ended December 31,: 2018 2017 2016 Statutory tax rate 21% 35 % 35 % Adjustment to reflect REIT status (1) (21 ) (35 ) (35 ) Foreign taxes (8 ) 1 5 Foreign withholding taxes 4 3 4 Uncertain tax positions — — 5 Changes in tax laws — (2 ) — Impact from restructuring (6 ) — — Effective tax rate (10 )% 2 % 14 % _______________ F-37 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) (1) As a result of the ability to utilize the dividends paid deduction to offset the Company’s REIT income and gains. The domestic and foreign components of income from continuing operations before income taxes are as follows for the years ended December 31,: 2018 2017 2016 United States $ 1,212.7 $ 971.2 $ 882.6 Foreign (58.1 ) 284.9 243.3 Total $ 1,154.6 $ 1,256.1 $ 1,125.9 The components of the net deferred tax asset and liability and related valuation allowance were as follows as of December 31,: 2018 2017 Assets: Net operating loss carryforwards $ 264.9 $ 287.0 Accrued asset retirement obligations 165.7 157.0 Stock-based compensation 6.3 3.9 Unearned revenue 28.3 19.3 Unrealized loss on foreign currency 12.9 27.4 Other accruals and allowances 78.6 50.2 Items not currently deductible and other 26.2 28.0 Liabilities: Depreciation and amortization (757.0 ) (1,073.9 ) Deferred rent (36.9 ) (35.9 ) Other (15.3 ) (14.7 ) Subtotal (226.3 ) (551.7 ) Valuation allowance (151.9 ) (142.0 ) Net deferred tax liabilities $ (378.2 ) $ (693.7 ) At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company has provided a valuation allowance of $151.9 million and $142.0 million , respectively, which primarily relates to foreign items. The increase in the valuation allowance for the year ending December 31, 2018 is due to uncertainty as to the timing of, and the Company’s ability to recover, net deferred tax assets in certain foreign operations in the foreseeable future, offset by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if objective evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight may be given to subjective evidence such as the Company’s projections for growth. A summary of the activity in the valuation allowance is as follows: 2018 2017 2016 Balance as of January 1, $ 142.0 $ 144.4 $ 137.0 Additions (1) 15.7 11.6 14.1 Reversals — (9.1 ) — Foreign currency translation (5.8 ) (4.9 ) (6.7 ) Balance as of December 31, $ 151.9 $ 142.0 $ 144.4 _______________ (1) Includes net charges to expense and allowances established through goodwill at acquisition. The recoverability of the Company’s deferred tax assets has been assessed utilizing projections based on its current operations. Accordingly, the recoverability of the deferred tax assets is not dependent on material asset sales or other non-routine F-38 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) transactions. Based on its current outlook of future taxable income during the carryforward period, the Company believes that deferred tax assets, other than those for which a valuation allowance has been recorded, will be realized. Despite a mandatory one-time inclusion in U.S. taxable income of accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries under the Tax Act for the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company intends to continue to reinvest foreign earnings indefinitely outside of the U.S. and does not expect to incur any significant additional taxes, including withholding taxes, related to such amounts. At December 31, 2018 , the Company had net federal, state and foreign operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income. If not utilized, the Company’s NOLs expire as follows: Years ended December 31, Federal State Foreign 2019 to 2023 $ — $ 142.9 $ 46.0 2024 to 2028 141.7 378.4 142.7 2029 to 2033 — 13.9 4.5 2034 to 2038 10.6 135.4 — Indefinite carryforward 9.6 — 746.5 Total $ 161.9 $ 670.6 $ 939.7 As of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would impact the ETR, if recognized, is $93.7 million and $105.8 million , respectively. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits for the year ended December 31, 2018 includes additions to the Company’s existing tax positions of $8.4 million . The Company expects the unrecognized tax benefits to change over the next 12 months if certain tax matters ultimately settle with the applicable taxing jurisdiction during this timeframe, or if the applicable statute of limitations lapses. The impact of the amount of such changes to previously recorded uncertain tax positions could range from zero to $2.7 million . A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits are as follows for the years ended December 31,: 2018 2017 2016 Balance at January 1 $ 116.7 $ 107.6 $ 28.1 Additions based on tax positions related to the current year 8.1 7.6 82.9 Additions and reductions for tax positions of prior years 0.3 — — Foreign currency (8.1 ) 1.9 (0.2 ) Reduction as a result of the lapse of statute of limitations (2.6 ) (0.4 ) (3.2 ) Reduction as a result of effective settlements (6.7 ) — — Balance at December 31 $ 107.7 $ 116.7 $ 107.6 During the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , the statute of limitations on certain unrecognized tax benefits lapsed and certain positions were effectively settled, which resulted in a decrease of $9.3 million , $0.4 million and $3.2 million , respectively, in the liability for uncertain tax benefits. The Company recorded penalties and tax-related interest expense to the tax provision of $8.0 million , $5.0 million and $9.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. In addition, due to the expiration of the statute of limitations in certain jurisdictions and certain positions that were effectively settled, the Company reduced its liability for penalties and income tax-related interest expense related to uncertain tax positions during the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 by $16.2 million , $0.6 million and $3.4 million , respectively. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , the total amount of accrued income tax-related interest and penalties included in the consolidated balance sheets were $19.1 million and $29.0 million , respectively. The Company has filed for prior taxable years, and for its taxable year ended December 31, 2018 will file, numerous consolidated and separate income tax returns, including U.S. federal and state tax returns and foreign tax returns. The Company F-39 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) is subject to examination in the U.S. and various state and foreign jurisdictions for certain tax years. As a result of the Company’s ability to carryforward federal, state and foreign NOLs, the applicable tax years generally remain open to examination several years after the applicable loss carryforwards have been used or have expired. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the tax jurisdictions resulting from these examinations. The Company believes that adequate provisions have been made for income taxes for all periods through December 31, 2018 . 13. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION Summary of Stock-Based Compensation Plans —The Company maintains equity incentive plans that provide for the grant of stock-based awards to its directors, officers and employees. The 2007 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended (the “2007 Plan”), provides for the grant of non-qualified and incentive stock options, as well as restricted stock units, restricted stock and other stock-based awards. Exercise prices for non-qualified and incentive stock options are not less than the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. Equity awards typically vest ratably, generally over four years for RSUs and stock options and three years for PSUs. Stock options generally expire 10 years from the date of grant. As of December 31, 2018 , the Company had the ability to grant stock-based awards with respect to an aggregate of 7.7 million shares of common stock under the 2007 Plan. In addition, the Company maintains an employee stock purchase plan (the “ESPP”) pursuant to which eligible employees may purchase shares of the Company’s common stock on the last day of each bi-annual offering period at a 15% discount from the lower of the closing market value on the first or last day of such offering period. The offering periods run from June 1 through November 30 and from December 1 through May 31 of each year. During the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , the Company recorded and capitalized the following stock-based compensation expenses: 2018 2017 2016 Stock-based compensation expense $ 137.5 $ 108.5 $ 89.9 Stock-based compensation expense capitalized as property and equipment 2.0 1.6 1.4 Stock Options —The fair value of each option granted during the period was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model based on the assumptions noted in the table below. The expected life of stock options (estimated period of time outstanding) was estimated using the vesting term and historical exercise behavior of the Company’s employees. The risk-free interest rate was based on the U.S. Treasury yield with a term that approximated the estimated life in effect at the accounting measurement date. The expected volatility of the underlying stock price was based on historical volatility for a period equal to the expected life of the stock options. The expected annual dividend yield was the Company’s best estimate of expected future dividend yield. There were no options granted during the year ended December 31, 2018. Key assumptions used to apply the Black-Scholes option pricing model were as follows (percentages and years disclosed in full amounts): 2017 2016 Range of risk-free interest rate 1.88%-1.94% 1.00%-1.73% Weighted average risk-free interest rate 1.89% 1.44% Range of expected life of stock options 5.2 years 4.5 - 5.2 years Range of expected volatility of the underlying stock price 18.95% - 19.45% 20.59% - 21.45% Weighted average expected volatility of underlying stock price 19.05% 21.43% Range of expected annual dividend yield 2.40% 1.85% - 2.40% The weighted average grant date fair value per share during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $16.84 and $14.60 , respectively. The intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 was $98.8 million , $100.3 million and $77.6 million , respectively. As of December 31, 2018 , total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock options was $4.5 million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately one year. The amount of cash received from the exercise of stock options was $88.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 .

(2) PSUs represent the shares above target that are issuable for the 2016 PSUs at the end of the three -year performance cycle based on exceeding the performance metric for the three-year performance period, or 169,340 shares, and the target number of shares issuable at the end of the three-year performance period for the 2018 PSUs, or 131,311 shares. (3) PSUs consist of shares vested pursuant to the 2015 PSUs. There are no additional shares to be earned related to the 2015 PSUs. RSUs exclude 32,596 shares that are vested and deferred. (4) Vested and deferred RSUs are related to deferred compensation for certain former employees. The total fair value of RSUs and PSUs that vested during the year ended December 31, 2018 was $115.1 million . F-41 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) Restricted Stock Units— As of December 31, 2018 , total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested RSUs granted under the 2007 Plan was $111.8 million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately two years . Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units— During the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016, the Company’s Compensation Committee granted an aggregate of 131,311 PSUs (the “2018 PSUs”), 154,520 PSUs (the “2017 PSUs”), and 169,340 PSUs (the “2016 PSUs”), respectively, to its executive officers and established the performance metrics for these awards. Threshold, target and maximum parameters were established for the metrics for a three -year performance period with respect to each of the 2018 PSUs, the 2017 PSUs and the 2016 PSUs and will be used to calculate the number of shares that will be issuable when each award vests, which may range from zero to 200% of the target amounts. At the end of each three -year performance period, the number of shares that vest will depend on the degree of achievement against the pre-established performance goals. PSUs will be paid out in common stock at the end of each performance period, subject generally to the executive’s continued employment or death, disability or qualified retirement (each as defined in the applicable PSU award agreement). PSUs will accrue dividend equivalents prior to vesting, which will be paid out only in respect of shares that actually vest. On July 26, 2018, the Company changed the vesting terms of the PSU award agreements in the event of a participant’s death, disability or qualified retirement (each as defined in the applicable award agreement) for all plan participants with the exception of its Chief Executive Officer. During the year ended December 31, 2018 , the Company recorded $52.2 million in stock-based compensation expense for equity awards in which the performance goals have been established and were probable of being achieved. This amount included $19.1 million of incremental compensation that was accelerated in the third quarter due to the changes in vesting terms. The remaining unrecognized compensation expense related to these awards at December 31, 2018 , was $8.6 million based on the Company’s current assessment of the probability of achieving the performance goals. The weighted-average period over which the cost will be recognized is approximately two years . 14. REDEEMABLE NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests —On April 21, 2016, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, ATC Asia Pacific Pte. Ltd., acquired a 51% controlling ownership interest in ATC TIPL (formerly Viom), a telecommunications infrastructure company that owns and operates wireless communications towers and indoor DAS networks in India (the “Viom Acquisition”). In connection with the Viom Acquisition, the Company, through one of its subsidiaries, entered into a shareholders agreement (the “Shareholders Agreement”) with Viom and the following remaining Viom shareholders: Tata Sons Limited (“Tata Sons”), Tata Teleservices, IDFC Private Equity Fund III (“IDFC”), Macquarie SBI Infrastructure Investments Pte Limited and SBI Macquarie Infrastructure Trust (collectively, the “Remaining Shareholders”). During the year ended December 31, 2018, pursuant to the terms of the Shareholders Agreement, the Company merged its other wholly-owned India subsidiaries into ATC TIPL. As a result, the Company’s controlling interest in ATC TIPL increased from 51% to 63% , which resulted in an increase in the Company’s additional paid-in capital of $28.1 million . Similarly, the noncontrolling interest was reduced from 49% to 37% , and a corresponding adjustment to reduce the redeemable noncontrolling interest value by $28.1 million was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2018. In addition, the Company reclassified $78.8 million of previously recorded accumulated other comprehensive loss to additional paid-in capital due to the change in ownership of ATC TIPL. The Shareholders Agreement also provides certain of the Remaining Shareholders with put options, which allow them to sell outstanding shares of ATC TIPL to the Company, and the Company with call options, which allow it to buy the noncontrolling shares of ATC TIPL. The put options, which are not under the Company’s control, cannot be separated from the noncontrolling interests. As a result, the combination of the noncontrolling interests and the redemption feature requires classification as redeemable noncontrolling interests in the consolidated balance sheet, separate from equity. Given the provisions governing the put rights, the redeemable noncontrolling interests are recorded outside of permanent equity at their redemption value. The noncontrolling interests become redeemable after the passage of time, and therefore, the Company records the carrying amount of the noncontrolling interests at the greater of (i) the initial carrying amount, increased or decreased for the noncontrolling interests’ share of net income or loss and foreign currency translation adjustments, and (ii) the redemption value. If required, the Company will adjust the redeemable noncontrolling interests to redemption value on each balance sheet date with changes in redemption value recognized as an adjustment to Net income attributable to noncontrolling F-42 Table of Contents interests. Due primarily to the impact of impairment charges on net income and, as a result, on the carrying value of the noncontrolling interests, the Company adjusted noncontrolling interests by $86.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The put options may be exercised, requiring the Company to purchase the Remaining Shareholders’ equity interests, on specified dates through March 31, 2021. The price of the put options will be based on the fair market value of the exercising Remaining Shareholders’ interest in the Company’s India operations at the time the option is exercised. Put options held by certain of the Remaining Shareholders are subject to a floor price of 216 INR. In the fourth quarter of 2018, Tata Teleservices delivered to the Company notice of exercise of their put options under the Shareholders Agreement with respect to 50% of their combined holdings with Tata Sons of ATC TIPL. Also in the fourth quarter of 2018, IDFC delivered notice to the Company of exercise of its put option under the Shareholders Agreement with respect of 100% of its holdings of ATC TIPL. The Company expects to complete the redemption of the put shares, subject to regulatory approval, for total consideration of INR 29.4 billion (approximately $420.0 million ) in the first half of 2019. As a result of the redemption, the Company’s controlling interest in ATC TIPL would increase to approximately 79% . The changes in Redeemable noncontrolling interests for the year ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 Balance as of January 1, $ 1,126.2 $ 1,091.3 $ — Fair value at acquisition — — 1,100.9 Net (loss) income attributable to noncontrolling interests (87.9 ) (33.4 ) 13.9 Adjustment to noncontrolling interest redemption value 86.7 — — Adjustment to noncontrolling interest due to merger (28.1 ) — — Foreign currency translation adjustment attributable to noncontrolling interests (92.1 ) 68.3 (23.5 ) Balance as of December 31, $ 1,004.8 $ 1,126.2 $ 1,091.3 15. EQUITY Series B Preferred Stock —In March 2015, the Company issued 1,375,000 shares of its 5.50% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, Series B, par value $0.01 per share (the “Series B Preferred Stock”). As of December 31, 2017, the Company had 13,749,860 depositary shares, each representing a 1/10th interest in a share of its Series B Preferred Stock outstanding, after giving effect to the early conversion of 140 depositary shares at the option of the holder at a conversion rate of 0.8687 per depositary share in May 2017. On February 15, 2018, the Company paid the final dividend of $18.9 million to holders of the Series B Preferred Stock at the close of business on February 1, 2018. Unless converted or redeemed earlier, each share of the Series B Preferred Stock converted automatically on February 15, 2018 at a rate of 8.7420 per share of Series B Preferred Stock, or 0.8742 per depositary share, each representing a 1/10th interest in a share of Series B Preferred Stock, into shares of the Company’s common stock pursuant to the provisions of the Certificate of Designations governing the Series B Preferred Stock. As a result of the conversions of the Series B Preferred Stock in 2018, the Company issued an aggregate of 12,020,064 shares of its common stock. The Company paid cash in lieu of fractional shares of the Company’s common stock. These payments were recorded as a reduction to Additional paid-in capital. Dividends —The Company may pay dividends in cash or, subject to certain limitations, in shares of common stock or any combination of cash and shares of common stock.

During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company received an aggregate of $98.9 million in proceeds upon exercises of stock options and sales pursuant to the ESPP. Stock Repurchase Programs —In March 2011, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program, pursuant to which the Company is authorized to repurchase up to $1.5 billion of its common stock (the “2011 Buyback”). In December 2017, the Board of Directors approved an additional stock repurchase program, pursuant to which the Company is F-43 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) authorized to repurchase up to $2.0 billion of its common stock (the “2017 Buyback” and, together with the 2011 Buyback, the “Buyback Programs”). During the year ended December 31, 2018 , the Company repurchased 1,647,489 shares of its common stock under the 2011 Buyback for an aggregate of $232.8 million , including commissions and fees. As of December 31, 2018 , the Company had repurchased a total of 14,003,543 shares of its common stock under the 2011 Buyback for an aggregate of $1.4 billion , including commissions and fees. There were no repurchases under the 2017 Buyback. Under the Buyback Programs, the Company is authorized to purchase shares from time to time through open market purchases, in privately negotiated transactions not to exceed market prices, and (with respect to such open market purchases) pursuant to plans adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in accordance with securities laws and other legal requirements, and subject to market conditions and other factors. The Company expects to fund any further repurchases of its common stock through a combination of cash on hand, cash generated by operations and borrowings under its credit facilities. Purchases under the Buyback Programs are subject to the Company having available cash to fund repurchases. Distributions —During the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , the Company declared the following cash distributions: For the year ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 Distribution per share Aggregate Payment Amount (in millions) Distribution per share Aggregate Payment Amount (in millions) Distribution per share Aggregate Payment Amount (in millions) Common Stock $ 3.15 $ 1,389.8 $ 2.62 $ 1,122.5 $ 2.17 $ 923.7 Series A Preferred Stock (1) $ — $ — $ 2.63 $ 15.8 $ 5.25 $ 31.5 Series B Preferred Stock $ 13.75 $ 18.9 $ 55.00 $ 75.6 $ 55.00 $ 75.6 _______________ (1) 5.25% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, Series A, par value $0.01 per share (the “Series A Preferred Stock”), which converted into shares of the Company’s common stock pursuant to the provisions of the Certificate of Designations governing the Series A Preferred Stock in 2017.

During the year ended December 31, 2018 , the Company paid $4.3 million of distributions payable upon the vesting of restricted stock units. To maintain its qualification for taxation as a REIT, the Company expects to continue paying distributions, the amount, timing and frequency of which will be determined and subject to adjustment by the Company’s Board of Directors. 16. OTHER OPERATING EXPENSE Other operating expense consists primarily of impairment charges, net losses on sales or disposals of assets and other operating expense items. The Company records impairment charges to write down certain assets to their net realizable value after an indicator of impairment is identified and subsequent analysis determines that the asset is either partially recoverable or not recoverable. These assets consisted primarily of towers, which are typically assessed on an individual basis, network location intangibles, which relate directly to towers, and tenant-related intangibles, which are assessed on a tenant basis. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, impairment charges included amounts related to land easements. Net losses on sales or disposals of assets primarily relate to certain non-core towers, other assets and miscellaneous items. Other operating expenses includes acquisition-related costs and integration costs. Other operating expenses included the following for the years ended December 31,: 2018 2017 2016 Impairment charges $ 394.0 $ 211.4 $ 28.5 Net losses on sales or disposals of assets 85.6 32.8 25.1 Other operating expenses (1) 33.7 11.8 19.7 Total Other operating expenses $ 513.3 $ 256.0 $ 73.3 _______________ (1) For the year ended December 31, 2017, the amount also includes refunds of acquisition costs and a charitable contribution. Impairment charges included the following for the years ended December 31,: 2018 2017 2016 Tower and network location intangible assets $ 284.9 $ 108.7 $ 18.0 Tenant relationships 107.3 100.1 — Other 1.8 2.6 10.5 Total impairment charges $ 394.0 $ 211.4 $ 28.5 On February 28, 2018, one of the Company’s tenants in Asia, Aircel Ltd.’s (“Aircel”), filed for bankruptcy protection with the National Company Law Tribunal of India. The bankruptcy process is ongoing and the ultimate outcome has yet to be determined. The Company performed an impairment test based on current expectations of the impact of the bankruptcy on projected cash flows for assets related to Aircel. These assets primarily consisted of towers, network location intangibles and tenant-related intangibles. As a result, an impairment of $40.1 million was recorded on the tower and network location intangible assets. The Company also fully impaired the tenant relationship for Aircel, which resulted in an impairment of $107.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. In October 2017, one of the Company’s tenants in Asia, Tata Teleservices, informed the Department of Telecommunications in India of its intent to exit the wireless telecommunications business and announced plans to transfer its business to another telecommunications provider. In October 2018, the Company entered into agreements with Tata for a settlement and release of certain contractual lease obligations of Tata. The Company performed an impairment test based on current expectations of the impact of the settlement on projected cash flows for assets related to Tata. These assets consisted primarily of towers, network F-45 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) location intangibles and tenant-related intangibles. As a result, an impairment of $164.2 million was recorded on the tower and network location intangible assets. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recorded an additional $54.0 million of impairments on tower and network location intangible assets related to other carrier consolidation-driven churn in India. During the year ended December 31, 2017, $81.0 million of impairment charges on tower and network location intangible assets and all impairment charges on tenant relationships related to carrier consolidation-driven churn in India. 17.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Litigation —The Company periodically becomes involved in various claims, lawsuits and proceedings that are incidental to its business. In the opinion of Company management, after consultation with counsel, there are no matters currently pending that would, in the event of an adverse outcome, materially impact the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Verizon Transaction —In March 2015, the Company entered into an agreement with various operating entities of Verizon Communications Inc. (“Verizon”) that currently provides for the lease, sublease or management of approximately 11,250 wireless communications sites commencing March 27, 2015. The average term of the lease or sublease for all sites at the inception of the agreement was approximately 28 years , assuming renewals or extensions of the underlying ground leases for the sites. The Company has the option to purchase the leased sites in tranches, subject to the applicable lease, sublease or management rights upon its scheduled expiration. Each tower is assigned to an annual tranche, ranging from 2034 to 2047, which represents the outside expiration date for the sublease rights to the towers in that tranche. The purchase price for each tranche is a fixed amount stated in the lease for such tranche plus the fair market value of certain alterations made to the related towers. The aggregate purchase option price for the towers leased and subleased is approximately $5.0 billion . Verizon will occupy the sites as a tenant for an initial term of ten years with eight optional successive five -year terms; each such term shall be governed by standard master lease agreement terms established as a part of the transaction. AT&T Transaction —The Company has an agreement with SBC Communications Inc., a predecessor entity to AT&T Inc. (“AT&T”), that currently provides for the lease or sublease of approximately 2,280 towers commencing between December 2000 and August 2004. Substantially all of the towers are part of the Trust Securitizations. The average term of the lease or sublease for all sites at the inception of the agreement was approximately 27 years , assuming renewals or extensions of the underlying ground leases for the sites. The Company has the option to purchase the sites subject to the applicable lease or sublease upon its expiration. Each tower is assigned to an annual tranche, ranging from 2013 to 2032, which represents the outside expiration date for the sublease rights to that tower. The purchase price for each site is a fixed amount stated in the lease for that site plus the fair market value of certain alterations made to the related tower by AT&T. As of December 31, 2018 , the Company has purchased an aggregate of 149 of the subleased towers upon expiration of the applicable agreement, including 61 F-46 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) towers purchased during the year ended December 31, 2018 for an aggregate purchase price of $22.2 million . The aggregate purchase option price for the remaining towers leased and subleased is $891.5 million and will accrete at a rate of 10% per annum through the applicable expiration of the lease or sublease of a site. For all such sites, AT&T has the right to continue to lease the reserved space through June 30, 2020 at the then-current monthly fee, which shall escalate in accordance with the standard master lease agreement for the remainder of AT&T’s tenancy. Thereafter, AT&T shall have the right to renew such lease for up to four successive five -year terms. ALLTEL Transaction —In December 2000, the Company entered into an agreement with ALLTEL Communications, LLC, a predecessor entity to Verizon Wireless, to acquire towers through a 15 -year sublease agreement. Pursuant to the agreement, as amended, with Verizon Wireless, the Company acquired rights to approximately 1,800 towers in tranches between April 2001 and March 2002. The Company has the option to purchase each tower at the expiration of the applicable sublease. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company exercised the purchase options for 1,523 towers and provided notice to the tower owner, Verizon’s assignee, of its intent to exercise the purchase options related to the 243 remaining towers. As of December 31, 2018 , the purchase price per tower was $42,844 payable in cash or, at the tower owner’s option, with 769 shares of the Company’s common stock per tower. The aggregate cash purchase option price for the subleased towers was $10.4 million as of December 31, 2018 . Other Contingencies —The Company is subject to income tax and other taxes in the geographic areas where it operates, and periodically receives notifications of audits, assessments or other actions by taxing authorities. Taxing authorities may issue preliminary notices or assessments while audits are being conducted. In certain jurisdictions, taxing authorities may issue assessments with minimal examination. These notices and assessments do not represent amounts that the Company is obligated to pay and are often not reflective of the actual tax liability for which the Company will ultimately be liable. The Company evaluates the circumstances of each notification or assessment based on the information available and records a liability for any potential outcome that is probable or more likely than not unfavorable if the liability is also reasonably estimable. On December 5, 2016, the Company received an income tax assessment of Essar Telecom Infrastructure Private Limited (“ETIPL”) from the India Income Tax Department (the “Tax Department”) for the fiscal year ending 2008 in the amount of 4.75 billion INR ( $69.8 million on the date of assessment) related to capital contributions. The Company challenged the assessment before the Office of Commissioner of Income Tax - Appeals, which ruled in the Company’s favor in January 2018. However, the Tax Department has appealed this ruling at a higher appellate authority. The Company estimates that there is a more likely than not probability that the Company’s position will be sustained upon appeal. Accordingly, no liability has been recorded. Additionally, the assessment was made with respect to transactions that took place in the tax year commencing in 2007, prior to the Company’s acquisition of ETIPL. Under the Company’s definitive acquisition agreement of ETIPL, the seller is obligated to indemnify and defend the Company with respect to any tax-related liability that may arise from activities prior to March 31, 2010. Lease Obligations —The Company leases certain land, office and tower space under operating leases that expire over various terms. Many of the leases contain renewal options with specified increases in lease payments upon exercise of the renewal option. Escalation clauses present in operating leases, excluding those tied to a consumer price index or other inflation-based indices, are recognized on a straight-line basis over the non-cancellable term of the applicable leases. Future minimum rental payments under non-cancellable operating leases include payments for certain renewal periods at the Company’s option because failure to renew could result in a loss of the applicable communications sites and related revenues from tenant leases, thereby making it reasonably assured that the Company will renew the leases. Such payments at December 31, 2018 are as follows: Year Ending December 31, 2019 $ 926.0 2020 904.2 2021 879.8 2022 834.2 2023 792.6 Thereafter 6,173.1 Total $ 10,509.9 F-47 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) Aggregate rent expense (including the effect of straight-line rent expense) under operating leases for the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 approximated $1,128.0 million , $1,088.0 million and $986.2 million , respectively. Future minimum payments under capital leases in effect at December 31, 2018 were as follows: Year Ending December 31, 2019 $ 40.7 2020 32.7 2021 27.8 2022 23.7 2023 19.2 Thereafter 117.5 Total minimum lease payments 261.6 Less amounts representing interest (82.1 ) Present value of capital lease obligations $ 179.5 Tenant Leases —The Company’s lease agreements with its tenants vary depending upon the region and the industry of the tenant, and generally have initial terms of ten years with multiple renewal terms at the option of the tenant. Historically, the Company has been able to successfully renew its ground leases as needed to ensure its tower revenue. Accordingly, the Company assumes that it will have access to the land underneath its tower sites when calculating future minimum rental receipts. Future minimum rental receipts expected from tenants under non-cancellable operating lease agreements in effect at December 31, 2018 were as follows: Year Ending December 31, 2019 $ 5,251.2 2020 5,062.2 2021 4,676.1 2022 3,754.6 2023 3,457.3 Thereafter 12,641.1 Total $ 34,842.5 Guaranties and Indemnifications —The Company enters into agreements from time to time in the ordinary course of business pursuant to which it agrees to guarantee or indemnify third parties for certain claims. The Company has also entered into purchase and sale agreements relating to the sale or acquisition of assets containing customary indemnification provisions. The Company’s indemnification obligations under these agreements generally are limited solely to damages resulting from breaches of representations and warranties or covenants under the applicable agreements. In addition, payments under such indemnification clauses are generally conditioned on the other party making a claim that is subject to whatever defenses the Company may have and are governed by dispute resolution procedures specified in the particular agreement. Further, the Company’s obligations under these agreements may be limited in duration and amount, and in some instances, the Company may have recourse against third parties for payments made by the Company. The Company has not historically made any material payments under these agreements and, as of December 31, 2018 , is not aware of any agreements that could result in a material payment.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS The Company’s primary business is leasing space on multitenant communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, wireless data providers, government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries. This business is referred to as the Company’s property operations, which as of December 31, 2018, consisted of the following: • U.S.: property operations in the United States; • Asia: property operations in India; • Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”): property operations in France, Germany, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa and Uganda; and • Latin America: property operations in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico, Paraguay and Peru. The Company’s services segment offers tower-related services in the United States, including AZP and structural analysis, which primarily support its site leasing business, including the addition of new tenants and equipment on its sites. The services segment is a strategic business unit that offers different services from, and requires different resources, skill sets and marketing strategies than, the property operating segments. The accounting policies applied in compiling segment information below are similar to those described in note 1. Among other factors, in evaluating financial performance in each business segment, management uses segment gross margin and segment operating profit. The Company defines segment gross margin as segment revenue less segment operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation expense recorded in costs of operations; Depreciation, amortization and accretion; Selling, general, administrative and development expense; and Other operating expenses. The Company defines segment operating profit as segment gross margin less Selling, general, administrative and development expense attributable to the segment, excluding stock-based compensation expense and corporate expenses. For reporting purposes, for periods through September 30, 2018, the Latin America property segment gross margin and segment operating profit also include Interest income (expense), TV Azteca, net. These measures of segment gross margin and segment operating profit are also before Interest income, Interest expense, Gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations, Other income (expense), Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and Income tax benefit (provision). The categories of expenses indicated above, such as depreciation, have been excluded from segment operating performance as they are not considered in the review of information or the evaluation of results by management. There are no significant revenues resulting from transactions between the Company’s operating segments. All intercompany transactions are eliminated to reconcile segment results and assets to the consolidated statements of operations and consolidated balance sheets.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 2019 Term Loan— On February 14, 2019, the Company entered into a $1.3 billion unsecured term loan (the “2019 Term Loan”), the net proceeds of which were used, together with cash on hand, to repay all outstanding indebtedness under the 2018 Term Loan. The 2019 Term Loan matures on February 13, 2020. The Company has the option of choosing either a defined base rate or LIBOR as the applicable base rate for borrowings under the 2019 Term Loan. The interest rate on the 2019 Term Loan ranges between 0.550% and 1.375% above LIBOR for LIBOR based borrowings or up to 0.375% above the defined base rate for base rate borrowings, in each case based upon the Company’s debt ratings. The current margin over LIBOR for the 2019 F-54 Table of Contents AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed) Term Loan is 0.800% . Any outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest will be due and payable in full at maturity. The 2019 Term Loan does not require amortization of principal and may be paid prior to maturity in whole or in part at the Company’s option without penalty or premium. The agreement for the 2019 Term Loan contains certain reporting, information, financial and operating covenants and other restrictions (including limitations on additional debt, guaranties, sales of assets and liens) with which the Company must comply. Any failure to comply with the financial and operating covenants of the loan agreement may constitute a default, which could result in, among other things, the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable.
