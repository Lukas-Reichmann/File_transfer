Dated: November 9, 2023 Verra Mobility Corporation By: /s/ Craig Conti Name: Craig Conti Title: Chief Financial Officer 4-;-EX-99.1: Exhibit 99.1 Verra Mobility Announces Third Quarter 2023 Financial Results MESA, Ariz., November 9, 2023 /PRNewswire/ – Verra Mobility Corporation (NASDAQ: VRRM), a leading provider of smart mobility technology solutions, announced today the financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2023. “Our team delivered tremendous results for the third quarter, highlighted by strong recurring revenue growth and free cash flow generation,” said David Roberts, President and CEO, Verra Mobility. “Additionally, we delivered on our commitments including renewing a key customer contract in our Commercial Services business and continuing to execute a balanced capital allocation strategy. With our focus on commercial excellence and the favorable trends in the markets we serve, we are again increasing our financial guidance and look forward to continuing our positive momentum as we close out the year.” Third Quarter 2023 Financial Highlights 1 We report our results of operations based on three operating segments: Third Quarter 2023 Segment Detail Liquidity: As of September 30, 2023, cash and cash equivalents were $114.4 million, and we generated $62.4 million in cash flows from operations for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Interest Rate Swap In December 2022, we entered into a cancellable interest rate swap agreement to hedge our exposure to interest rate fluctuations associated with the LIBOR (now transitioned to Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate) portion of the variable interest rate on our 2021 Term Loan. Under the interest rate swap agreement, we pay a fixed rate of 5.17% and the counterparty pays a variable interest rate which is net settled. The notional amount on the interest rate swap is $675.0 million. We have the option to terminate the interest rate swap agreement starting in December 2023, and monthly thereafter until December 2025 in the event interest rates decrease. Any changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument (including accrued interest) and related cash payments are recorded in the condensed consolidated statements of operations within the loss (gain) on interest rate swap line item. We recorded a $0.1 million loss during the three months ended September 30, 2023, of which approximately $0.2 million is associated with the derivative instrument re-measured to fair value at the end of the reporting period, netted by $0.1 million related to the net cash received. We recorded a $1.9 million gain during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, of which approximately $3.3 million is associated with the derivative instrument re-measured to fair value at the end of the reporting period, netted by $1.4 million related to the monthly cash payments. 2 Warrants During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we processed the exercise of 20 million warrants in exchange for the issuance of 16,273,406 shares of Class A Common Stock. There were 14,035,449 shares issued on a cash-basis resulting in the receipt of $161.4 million in cash proceeds as of September 30, 2023. Share Repurchases In November 2022, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to an aggregate amount of $100.0 million of our outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock over an 18-month period in open market, accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) or privately negotiated transactions, each as permitted under applicable rules and regulations, any of which may use pre-arranged trading plans that are designed to meet the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act. We paid $8.1 million to repurchase 449,432 shares of our Class A Common Stock through open market transactions during the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, which we subsequently retired. On September 5, 2023, we used the remaining availability under the share repurchase program for an ASR and paid approximately $91.9 million to receive an initial delivery of 4,131,551 shares of our Class A Common Stock in accordance with an ASR agreement with a third-party financial institution. The final settlement is expected to occur during the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, at which time, a volume-weighted average price calculation over the term of the ASR agreement will be used to determine the final number and the average price of shares repurchased and retired. We paid a total of $100.0 million for shares repurchases during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. New Share Repurchase Program In October 2023, the Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program, which authorizes the Company to repurchase up to $100 million of its Class A common stock over the next eighteen months from time to time in open market transactions, accelerated share repurchases or in privately negotiated transactions, each as permitted under applicable rules and regulations. Repurchases may be conducted and may be suspended or terminated at any time without notice. The extent to which the Company repurchases shares of its Class A common stock and the timing of such purchases will depend upon market conditions, the Company's capital position, and other considerations as may be considered by the Company in its sole discretion. Repurchases may also be made pursuant to a trading plan under Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which would permit shares to be repurchased when the Company might otherwise be precluded from doing so because of self-imposed trading blackout periods or other regulatory restrictions. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including price, general business and market conditions, and alternative investment opportunities. The repurchase program will be executed consistent with the Company’s capital allocation strategy, which will continue to prioritize investments to grow the business. 3 2023 Full Year Guidance Any guidance that we provide is subject to change as a variety of factors can affect actual operating results.

Forward-Looking Statements This press release contains forward-looking statements which address our expected future business and financial performance, and may contain words such as “goal,” “target,” “future,” “estimate,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “seek,” “project,” “may,” “should,” “will” or similar expressions. Examples of forward-looking statements include, among others, statements regarding the benefits of our strategic acquisitions, changes in the market for our products and services, expected operating results, such as revenue growth, expansion plans and opportunities, and earnings guidance related to 2023 financial and operational metrics. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties and a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those currently anticipated. These factors include, but are not limited to, economic and geopolitical conditions; customer concentration, demand and spending; new and emerging technologies; cybersecurity risks; our ability to manage our substantial level of indebtedness; risks and uncertainties related to our government contracts, including legislative 4 changes, termination rights, delays in payments, audits and investigations; legislative changes; our reliance on a limited number of third-party vendors and service providers; and other risks and uncertainties indicated from time to time in documents filed or to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) by Verra Mobility. In addition, no assurance can be given that any plan, initiative, projection, goal, commitment, expectation, or prospect set forth in this release can or will be achieved. This press release should be read in conjunction with the information included in our other press releases, reports and other filings with the SEC. Understanding the information contained in these filings is important in order to fully understand our reported financial results and our business outlook for future periods. Additional Information We periodically provide information for investors on our corporate website, www.verramobility.com , and our investor relations website, ir.verramobility.com . We intend to use our website as a means of disclosing material non-public information and for complying with disclosure obligations under Regulation FD. Accordingly, investors should monitor our website, in addition to following our press releases, SEC filings and public conference calls and webcasts. Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to disclosing financial results that are determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), we also disclose certain non-GAAP financial information in this press release. These financial measures are not recognized measures under GAAP and are not intended to be, and should not be, considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EPS and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. These non-GAAP financial measures may be determined or calculated differently by other companies. As a result, they may not be comparable to similarly titled performance measures presented by other companies. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measurements to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measurements have been provided in the financial statement tables included in this press release, and investors are encouraged to review the reconciliations. We are not providing a quantitative reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA or Adjusted EPS, both of which are included in our 2023 financial guidance above, in reliance on the “unreasonable efforts” exception for forward-looking non-GAAP measures set forth in SEC rules because certain financial information, the probable significance of which cannot be determined, is not available and cannot be reasonably estimated without unreasonable effort and expense. In this regard, we are unable to provide a reconciliation of forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA to GAAP net income as well as Adjusted EPS to net income per share, due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliation. Due to the uncertainty of estimates and assumptions used in preparing forward-looking non-GAAP measures, we caution investors that actual results could differ materially from these non-GAAP financial projections. We use these non-GAAP financial metrics to measure our performance from period to period both at the consolidated level as well as within our operating segments, to evaluate and fund incentive compensation programs and to compare our results to those of our competitors. In addition, we also believe that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors regarding financial and business trends related to our results of operations and that when non-GAAP financial information is viewed with GAAP financial information, investors are provided with a more meaningful understanding of our ongoing operating performance. These non-GAAP measures have certain limitations as analytical tools and should not be used as substitutes for net income, cash flows from operations, earnings per share or other consolidated income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with GAAP. 5 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA We define EBITDA as net income adjusted to exclude interest expense, net, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA further excludes certain non-cash expenses and other transactions that management believes are not indicative of our ongoing operating performance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, as defined, exclude some but not all items that affect our cash flow from operating activities. Free Cash Flow We define “ Free Cash Flow ” as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. Adjusted Net Income We define “Adjusted Net Income” as net income adjusted to exclude amortization of intangibles and certain non-cash or non-recurring expenses. Adjusted EPS We define “Adjusted EPS” as Adjusted Net Income divided by the diluted weighted average shares for the period. Adjusted EBITDA Margin We define “Adjusted EBITDA Margin” as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of total revenue. 6 VERRA MOBILITY CORPORATION CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (Unaudited) (In

Dated: November 9, 2023 Verra Mobility Corporation By: /s/ Craig Conti Name: Craig Conti Title: Chief Financial Officer 4","EX-99.1: Exhibit 99.1 Verra Mobility Announces Third Quarter 2023 Financial Results MESA, Ariz., November 9, 2023 /PRNewswire/ – Verra Mobility Corporation (NASDAQ: VRRM), a leading provider of smart mobility technology solutions, announced today the financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2023. “Our team delivered tremendous results for the third quarter, highlighted by strong recurring revenue growth and free cash flow generation,” said David Roberts, President and CEO, Verra Mobility. “Additionally, we delivered on our commitments including renewing a key customer contract in our Commercial Services business and continuing to execute a balanced capital allocation strategy. With our focus on commercial excellence and the favorable trends in the markets we serve, we are again increasing our financial guidance and look forward to continuing our positive momentum as we close out the year.” Third Quarter 2023 Financial Highlights 1 We report our results of operations based on three operating segments: Third Quarter 2023 Segment Detail Liquidity: As of September 30, 2023, cash and cash equivalents were $114.4 million, and we generated $62.4 million in cash flows from operations for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Interest Rate Swap In December 2022, we entered into a cancellable interest rate swap agreement to hedge our exposure to interest rate fluctuations associated with the LIBOR (now transitioned to Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate) portion of the variable interest rate on our 2021 Term Loan. Under the interest rate swap agreement, we pay a fixed rate of 5.17% and the counterparty pays a variable interest rate which is net settled. The notional amount on the interest rate swap is $675.0 million. We have the option to terminate the interest rate swap agreement starting in December 2023, and monthly thereafter until December 2025 in the event interest rates decrease. Any changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument (including accrued interest) and related cash payments are recorded in the condensed consolidated statements of operations within the loss (gain) on interest rate swap line item. We recorded a $0.1 million loss during the three months ended September 30, 2023, of which approximately $0.2 million is associated with the derivative instrument re-measured to fair value at the end of the reporting period, netted by $0.1 million related to the net cash received. We recorded a $1.9 million gain during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, of which approximately $3.3 million is associated with the derivative instrument re-measured to fair value at the end of the reporting period, netted by $1.4 million related to the monthly cash payments. 2 Warrants During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we processed the exercise of 20 million warrants in exchange for the issuance of 16,273,406 shares of Class A Common Stock. There were 14,035,449 shares issued on a cash-basis resulting in the receipt of $161.4 million in cash proceeds as of September 30, 2023. Share Repurchases In November 2022, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to an aggregate amount of $100.0 million of our outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock over an 18-month period in open market, accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) or privately negotiated transactions, each as permitted under applicable rules and regulations, any of which may use pre-arranged trading plans that are designed to meet the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act. We paid $8.1 million to repurchase 449,432 shares of our Class A Common Stock through open market transactions during the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, which we subsequently retired. On September 5, 2023, we used the remaining availability under the share repurchase program for an ASR and paid approximately $91.9 million to receive an initial delivery of 4,131,551 shares of our Class A Common Stock in accordance with an ASR agreement with a third-party financial institution. The final settlement is expected to occur during the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, at which time, a volume-weighted average price calculation over the term of the ASR agreement will be used to determine the final number and the average price of shares repurchased and retired. We paid a total of $100.0 million for shares repurchases during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. New Share Repurchase Program In October 2023, the Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program, which authorizes the Company to repurchase up to $100 million of its Class A common stock over the next eighteen months from time to time in open market transactions, accelerated share repurchases or in privately negotiated transactions, each as permitted under applicable rules and regulations. Repurchases may be conducted and may be suspended or terminated at any time without notice. The extent to which the Company repurchases shares of its Class A common stock and the timing of such purchases will depend upon market conditions, the Company's capital position, and other considerations as may be considered by the Company in its sole discretion. Repurchases may also be made pursuant to a trading plan under Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which would permit shares to be repurchased when the Company might otherwise be precluded from doing so because of self-imposed trading blackout periods or other regulatory restrictions. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including price, general business and market conditions, and alternative investment opportunities. The repurchase program will be executed consistent with the Company’s capital allocation strategy, which will continue to prioritize investments to grow the business. 3 2023 Full Year Guidance Any guidance that we provide is subject to change as a variety of factors can affect actual operating results.

Forward-Looking Statements This press release contains forward-looking statements which address our expected future business and financial performance, and may contain words such as “goal,” “target,” “future,” “estimate,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “seek,” “project,” “may,” “should,” “will” or similar expressions. Examples of forward-looking statements include, among others, statements regarding the benefits of our strategic acquisitions, changes in the market for our products and services, expected operating results, such as revenue growth, expansion plans and opportunities, and earnings guidance related to 2023 financial and operational metrics. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties and a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those currently anticipated. These factors include, but are not limited to, economic and geopolitical conditions; customer concentration, demand and spending; new and emerging technologies; cybersecurity risks; our ability to manage our substantial level of indebtedness; risks and uncertainties related to our government contracts, including legislative 4 changes, termination rights, delays in payments, audits and investigations; legislative changes; our reliance on a limited number of third-party vendors and service providers; and other risks and uncertainties indicated from time to time in documents filed or to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) by Verra Mobility. In addition, no assurance can be given that any plan, initiative, projection, goal, commitment, expectation, or prospect set forth in this release can or will be achieved. This press release should be read in conjunction with the information included in our other press releases, reports and other filings with the SEC. Understanding the information contained in these filings is important in order to fully understand our reported financial results and our business outlook for future periods. Additional Information We periodically provide information for investors on our corporate website, www.verramobility.com , and our investor relations website, ir.verramobility.com . We intend to use our website as a means of disclosing material non-public information and for complying with disclosure obligations under Regulation FD. Accordingly, investors should monitor our website, in addition to following our press releases, SEC filings and public conference calls and webcasts. Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to disclosing financial results that are determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), we also disclose certain non-GAAP financial information in this press release. These financial measures are not recognized measures under GAAP and are not intended to be, and should not be, considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EPS and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. These non-GAAP financial measures may be determined or calculated differently by other companies. As a result, they may not be comparable to similarly titled performance measures presented by other companies. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measurements to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measurements have been provided in the financial statement tables included in this press release, and investors are encouraged to review the reconciliations. We are not providing a quantitative reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA or Adjusted EPS, both of which are included in our 2023 financial guidance above, in reliance on the “unreasonable efforts” exception for forward-looking non-GAAP measures set forth in SEC rules because certain financial information, the probable significance of which cannot be determined, is not available and cannot be reasonably estimated without unreasonable effort and expense. In this regard, we are unable to provide a reconciliation of forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA to GAAP net income as well as Adjusted EPS to net income per share, due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliation. Due to the uncertainty of estimates and assumptions used in preparing forward-looking non-GAAP measures, we caution investors that actual results could differ materially from these non-GAAP financial projections. We use these non-GAAP financial metrics to measure our performance from period to period both at the consolidated level as well as within our operating segments, to evaluate and fund incentive compensation programs and to compare our results to those of our competitors. In addition, we also believe that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors regarding financial and business trends related to our results of operations and that when non-GAAP financial information is viewed with GAAP financial information, investors are provided with a more meaningful understanding of our ongoing operating performance. These non-GAAP measures have certain limitations as analytical tools and should not be used as substitutes for net income, cash flows from operations, earnings per share or other consolidated income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with GAAP. 5 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA We define EBITDA as net income adjusted to exclude interest expense, net, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA further excludes certain non-cash expenses and other transactions that management believes are not indicative of our ongoing operating performance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, as defined, exclude some but not all items that affect our cash flow from operating activities. Free Cash Flow We define “ Free Cash Flow ” as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. Adjusted Net Income We define “Adjusted Net Income” as net income adjusted to exclude amortization of intangibles and certain non-cash or non-recurring expenses. Adjusted EPS We define “Adjusted EPS” as Adjusted Net Income divided by the diluted weighted average shares for the period. Adjusted EBITDA Margin We define “Adjusted EBITDA Margin” as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of total revenue. 6 VERRA MOBILITY CORPORATION CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (Unaudited) (In

Dated: August 17, 2023 Verra Mobility Corporation By: /s/ Craig Conti Name: Craig Conti Title: Chief Financial Officer 3-;-EX-99.1:Exhibit 99.1 August 17, 2023 NOTICE OF REDEMPTION OF CERTAIN WARRANTS (CUSIP 92511U 110) Dear Public Warrant Holder, Verra Mobility Corporation (the “ Company ”) hereby gives notice that it is redeeming, at 5:00 p.m. New York City time on September 18, 2023 (the “ Redemption Date ”), all of the Company’s outstanding warrants (the “ Public Warrants ”) to purchase shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “ Common Stock ”), that were issued under that certain Warrant Agreement, dated January 12, 2017 (as amended, the “ Warrant Agreement ”), by and between the Company and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, a New York corporation, as original warrant agent (“ Continental ”), as amended by that certain First Amendment to Warrant Agreement, dated as of January 15, 2020, by and among the Company, Continental and American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC (now Equiniti Trust Company, LLC), a New York limited liability company, as existing warrant agent (the “ Warrant Agent ”), and that certain Second Amendment to Warrant Agreement, dated as of May 11, 2023, by and between the Company and the Warrant Agent, as part of the units sold in the Company’s initial public offering (the “ IPO ”) for a redemption price of $0.01 per Public Warrant (the “ Redemption Price ”). Each Public Warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one share of Common Stock for a purchase price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustments. Any Public Warrants that remain unexercised at 5:00 p.m. New York City time on the Redemption Date will be void and no longer exercisable and their holders will have no rights with respect to those Public Warrants, except to receive the Redemption Price or as otherwise described in this notice for holders who hold their Public Warrants in “street name.” Warrants that were issued under the Warrant Agreement in a private placement simultaneously with the IPO and continue to be held by the initial holders thereof or their permitted transferees (“ Private Placement Warrants ”) are not subject to this notice of redemption. If you believe that you hold a Private Placement Warrant, please see the section of this notice entitled “Private Placement Warrants” for additional instructions. The Public Warrants are listed on the OTC Pink Marketplace under the symbol “VRRMW”. On August 14, 2023, the closing price of the Public Warrants was $8.18, and the closing price of the Common Stock, listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “VRRM,” was $19.30. TERMS OF REDEMPTION; CESSATION OF RIGHTS The rights of the Public Warrant holders to exercise their Public Warrants will terminate immediately prior to 5:00 p.m. New York City time on the Redemption Date. At 5:00 p.m. New York City time on the Redemption Date and thereafter, holders of unexercised Public Warrants will have no rights with respect to those warrants, except to receive the Redemption Price or as otherwise described in this notice for holders who hold their Public Warrants in “street name.” We encourage you to consult with your broker, financial advisor and/or tax advisor to consider whether or not to exercise your Public Warrants. The Company is exercising this right to redeem the Public Warrants pursuant to Section 6 of the Warrant Agreement. Pursuant to Section 6.1 of the Warrant Agreement, the Company has the right to redeem all of the outstanding Public Warrants if the closing price of the Common Stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share on each of 20 trading days within any 30-day trading period ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which a notice of redemption is given. The last sales price of the Common Stock has been at least $18.00 per share on each of 20 trading days within the 30-day trading period ending on August 14, 2023 (which is the third trading day prior to the date of this redemption notice). EXERCISE PROCEDURE Public Warrant holders have until 5:00 p.m. New York City time on the Redemption Date to exercise their Public Warrants to purchase Common Stock. Each Public Warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one share of Common Stock at a cash price of $11.50 per Public Warrant exercised (the “ Exercise Price ”). In accordance with Section 3.3.1(b) of the Warrant Agreement, the Company’s board of directors has elected to require that, following delivery of this notice of redemption, all Public Warrants be exercised only on a cashless basis. DOCPROPERTY DOCXDOCID DMS=IManage Format=<<LIB>>\<<NUM>>.<<VER>> PRESERVELOCATION \* MERGEFORMAT ACTIVE\600389298.3 As a result of this election, holders may no longer exercise Public Warrants in exchange for payment in cash of the Exercise Price. Instead, a holder exercising a Public Warrant will be deemed to pay the per warrant Exercise Price by the surrender of approximately 0.566 of a share of Common Stock that such holder would have been entitled to receive upon a cash exercise of each Public Warrant. Accordingly, by virtue of the cashless exercise of the Public Warrants, exercising warrant holders will receive approximately 0.434 , of a share of Common Stock for each Public Warrant surrendered for exercise. The number of shares that each exercising warrant holder will receive by virtue of the cashless exercise was calculated in accordance with Section 3.3.1(b) of the Warrant Agreement and will be equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of shares underlying the Public Warrants held by such warrant holder, multiplied by the difference between $20.31, the average last sale price of the Common Stock for the ten trading days ending on August 14, 2023, the third trading day prior to the date of this notice (the “ Fair Market Value ”) and the Exercise Price, by (y) the Fair Market Value. If any holder of Public Warrants would, after taking into account all of such holder’s Public Warrants exercised at one time, be entitled to receive a fractional interest in a share of Common Stock, the number of shares the holder will be entitled to receive will be rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares. Those who hold their Public Warrants in “street name” should immediately contact their broker to determine their broker’s procedure for exercising their Public Warrants. Persons who are holders of record of their Public Warrants may exercise their Public Warrants by sending a fully and properly completed “Election to Purchase” (a form of which is attached hereto as Annex A ), duly executed and indicating, among of things, the number of Public Warrants being exercised, to the Warrant Agent: Equiniti Trust Company, LLC Attn: Reorg Warrants 6201 15th Avenue Brooklyn, NY 11219 Email: help@astfinancial.com Telephone: (800) 937-5449 The method of delivery of the Public Warrants is at the option and risk of the holder, but if mail is used, registered mail properly insured is suggested. The fully and properly completed Election to Purchase must be received by American Stock Transfer & Trust Company prior to 5:00 p.m. New York City time on the Redemption Date. Subject to the following paragraph, any failure to deliver a fully and properly completed Election to Purchase before such time will result in such holder’s Public Warrants being redeemed and not exercised. WARRANTS HELD IN STREET NAME For holders of Public Warrants who hold their warrants in “street name,” provided that a Notice of Guaranteed Delivery is received by the Warrant Agent prior to 5:00 p.m. New York City time on the Redemption Date, broker-dealers shall have two business days from the Redemption Date, or 5:00 p.m. New York City time on September 20, 2023, to deliver the Public Warrants to the Warrant Agent. Any such Public Warrant received without the Election to Purchase or the Notice of Guaranteed Delivery having been duly executed and fully and properly completed will be deemed to have been delivered for redemption (at $0.01 per Public Warrant), and not for exercise. REDEMPTION PROCEDURE Payment of the Redemption Price will be made by the Company upon presentation and surrender of a Public Warrant for payment after 5:00 p.m. New York City time on the Redemption Date. Those who hold their shares in “street name” should contact their broker to determine their broker’s procedure for redeeming their Public Warrants. PRIVATE PLACEMENT WARRANTS If you hold Private Placement Warrants, please contact the Company at IR@verramobility.com to provide documentation evidencing that you are the initial holder of the Private Placement Warrant or a permitted transferee (as defined in the Warrant Agreement). To avoid redemption, verified holders of Private Placement Warrants should contact the Warrant Agent and become a holder of record before the Redemption Date. ********************************* Any questions you may have about redemption and exercising your Public Warrants may be directed to the Warrant Agent at its address and telephone number set forth above.

Instead, a holder exercising a Public Warrant will be deemed to pay the per warrant Exercise Price by the surrender of approximately 0.566 of a share of Common Stock that such holder would have been entitled to receive upon a cash exercise of each Public Warrant. Accordingly, by virtue of the cashless exercise of the Public Warrants, exercising warrant holders will receive approximately 0.434 , of a share of Common Stock for each Public Warrant surrendered for exercise. The number of shares that each exercising warrant holder will receive by virtue of the cashless exercise was calculated in accordance with Section 3.3.1(b) of the Warrant Agreement and will be equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of shares underlying the Public Warrants held by such warrant holder, multiplied by the difference between $20.31, the average last sale price of the Common Stock for the ten trading days ending on August 14, 2023, the third trading day prior to the date of this notice (the “ Fair Market Value ”) and the Exercise Price, by (y) the Fair Market Value. If any holder of Public Warrants would, after taking into account all of such holder’s Public Warrants exercised at one time, be entitled to receive a fractional interest in a share of Common Stock, the number of shares the holder will be entitled to receive will be rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares. Those who hold their Public Warrants in “street name” should immediately contact their broker to determine their broker’s procedure for exercising their Public Warrants. Persons who are holders of record of their Public Warrants may exercise their Public Warrants by sending a fully and properly completed “Election to Purchase” (a form of which is attached hereto as Annex A ), duly executed and indicating, among of things, the number of Public Warrants being exercised, to the Warrant Agent: Equiniti Trust Company, LLC Attn: Reorg Warrants 6201 15th Avenue Brooklyn, NY 11219 Email: help@astfinancial.com Telephone: (800) 937-5449 The method of delivery of the Public Warrants is at the option and risk of the holder, but if mail is used, registered mail properly insured is suggested. The fully and properly completed Election to Purchase must be received by American Stock Transfer & Trust Company prior to 5:00 p.m. New York City time on the Redemption Date. Subject to the following paragraph, any failure to deliver a fully and properly completed Election to Purchase before such time will result in such holder’s Public Warrants being redeemed and not exercised. WARRANTS HELD IN STREET NAME For holders of Public Warrants who hold their warrants in “street name,” provided that a Notice of Guaranteed Delivery is received by the Warrant Agent prior to 5:00 p.m. New York City time on the Redemption Date, broker-dealers shall have two business days from the Redemption Date, or 5:00 p.m. New York City time on September 20, 2023, to deliver the Public Warrants to the Warrant Agent. Any such Public Warrant received without the Election to Purchase or the Notice of Guaranteed Delivery having been duly executed and fully and properly completed will be deemed to have been delivered for redemption (at $0.01 per Public Warrant), and not for exercise. REDEMPTION PROCEDURE Payment of the Redemption Price will be made by the Company upon presentation and surrender of a Public Warrant for payment after 5:00 p.m. New York City time on the Redemption Date. Those who hold their shares in “street name” should contact their broker to determine their broker’s procedure for redeeming their Public Warrants.

(NASDAQ: FATE), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of programmed cellular immunotherapies for cancer and immune disorders, today reported business highlights and financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2019. “The early safety and tolerability signals observed in patients receiving multiple doses of FT500, the first iPSC-derived cell therapy to undergo clinical investigation in the United States, are very encouraging. The ability to cost-effectively mass-produce a universal cell-based cancer immunotherapy, and to safely deliver that therapy ‘on demand’ in multiple doses, has the potential to transform outcomes for many patients,” said Scott Wolchko, President and Chief Executive Officer of Fate Therapeutics. “We continue to be very pleased with the Company’s rapid pace of innovation, product development and leadership in bringing iPSC-derived cell-based immunotherapies engineered with potent anti-tumor functionality to cancer patients. Our first engineered iPSC-derived NK cell product candidate, FT516, is ready for Phase 1 clinical evaluation following successful completion of cGMP production, and the IND application for our multi-antigen targeted CAR19 NK cell product candidate, FT596, has been submitted to the FDA. Additionally, with the renewal of our collaboration with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center for the development of iPSC-derived T-cell immunotherapies, we are well positioned to continue to lead the field in the development of off-the-shelf CAR T-cell therapy.” Universal, Off-the-Shelf NK Cell Cancer Immunotherapy Clinical Programs • No DLTs Reported at 300M Cell Dose Level in FT500 Monotherapy Arm. The first three patients with advanced solid tumors have been treated with multiple doses of FT500, the Company’s universal, off-the-shelf natural killer (NK) cell product candidate derived from a clonal master induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) line, at the second dose level in the study’s monotherapy arm. All three patients received three weekly doses of FT500 at 300 million cells per dose in an outpatient setting, which treatment cycle was well-tolerated with no dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and no FT500-related serious adverse events reported by investigators . All three subjects were eligible to receive a second, multi-dose treatment cycle of FT500 at 300 million cells per dose. • No DLTs Reported at 100M Cell Dose Level in FT500 ICI Combination Arm. The first three patients with advanced solid tumors have been treated with multiple doses of FT500 in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) in the study’s combination arm. All three patients received three weekly doses of FT500 at 100 million cells per dose in an outpatient setting, which treatment cycle was well-tolerated with no dose-limiting toxicities and no FT500-related serious adverse events reported by investigators. All three subjects were eligible to receive a second, multi-dose treatment cycle of FT500 at 100 million cells per dose in combination with ICI. • FT516 cGMP Production Completed and Product Released for Clinical Trial Initiation. The Company completed final product release testing for FT516, a universal, off-the-shelf NK cell product candidate derived from a clonal master iPSC line engineered to express a novel high-affinity, non-cleavable CD16 (hnCD16) Fc receptor. Starting with a single cryopreserved vial from a master engineered iPSC bank, hundreds of cryopreserved doses of FT516 were produced in a single cGMP campaign at a low cost per dose. The cryopreserved FT516 cell product met stringent post-thaw release specifications, including identity, purity, viability and functional activity. The Company is currently initiating clinical investigation of FT516 as a monotherapy for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia and in combination with CD20-directed monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of B-cell lymphoma. FT516 is the first-ever cell product in the world derived from a genetically engineered pluripotent stem cell to be cleared for clinical investigation. Universal, Off-the-Shelf NK Cell and T-cell Cancer Immunotherapy Preclinical Pipeline • Submitted IND for FT596 Multi-Antigen Targeted CAR NK Cell. FT596 is the Company’s first universal, off-the-shelf chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) NK cell product candidate, and is uniquely designed to engage multiple tumor-associated antigens expressed on cancer cells for best-in-class activity. The product candidate is derived from a master iPSC line engineered to express three functional anti-tumor components: a proprietary CAR targeting the B-cell antigen CD19; a novel hnCD16 Fc receptor for augmented antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity; and a unique IL-15 receptor fusion for enhanced NK cell activity. The Company submitted its Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for clinical investigation of FT596 as a monotherapy and in combination with monoclonal antibody therapy for the treatment of subjects with advanced B-cell lymphomas and advanced chronic lymphocytic leukemia. • Renewed iPSC-derived T-cell Collaboration with MSK. Under its collaboration with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) led by Michel Sadelain, M.D., Ph.D., Director of the Center for Cell Engineering and the Stephen and Barbara Friedman Chair, the Company is currently conducting IND-enabling activities for FT819, its first universal, off-the-shelf CAR T-cell product candidate. FT819 is derived from a clonal master engineered iPSC line having complete elimination of T-cell receptor (TCR) expression and insertion of a novel 1XX CAR targeting CD19 into the T-cell receptor alpha (TRAC) locus. The three-year renewal extends the Company’s exclusive collaboration with Dr. Sadelain for the research and development of iPSC-derived T-cell product candidates. Corporate Highlights • Received New U.S. Patent for CAR-encoded iPSCs. In May 2019, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office granted to the Company a patent foundational to off-the-shelf, iPSC-derived CAR T-cell therapy. U.S. Patent Number 10,287,606, entitled “Genomic Engineering of Pluripotent Cells,” covers iPSCs having a CAR construct encoded into the TRAC locus and an endogenous TCR alpha gene knocked out. The complete elimination of the endogenous TCR gene is critical in allogeneic CAR T-cell therapy to ensure the prevention of graft-versus-host disease, a life-threatening disease that can occur when donor T-cells attack a patient’s healthy tissue. • Expanded Board of Directors. In July 2019, the Company appointed Dr. Shefali Agarwal to its Board of Directors. Dr. Agarwal has nearly two decades of leadership experience across clinical development, medical research, clinical operations, regulatory, and medical affairs in oncology, and is currently the Chief Medical Officer of Epizyme, Inc., a clinical-stage company developing novel epigenetic therapies for cancer and other serious diseases.

About Fate Therapeutics’ iPSC Product Platform The Company’s proprietary induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) product platform enables mass production of off-the-shelf, engineered, homogeneous cell products that can be administered in repeat doses to mediate more effective pharmacologic activity, including in combination with cycles of other cancer treatments. Human iPSCs possess the unique dual properties of unlimited self-renewal and differentiation potential into all cell types of the body. The Company’s first-of-kind approach involves engineering human iPSCs in a one-time genetic modification event and selecting a single iPSC for maintenance as a clonal master iPSC line. Analogous to master cell lines used to manufacture biopharmaceutical drug products such as monoclonal antibodies, clonal master iPSC lines are a renewable source for manufacturing cell therapy products which are well-defined and uniform in composition, can be mass produced at significant scale in a cost-effective manner, and can be delivered off-the-shelf for patient treatment. As a result, the Company’s platform is uniquely capable of overcoming numerous limitations associated with the production of cell therapies using patient- or donor-sourced cells, which is logistically complex and expensive and is fraught with batch-to-batch and cell-to-cell variability that can affect safety and efficacy. Fate Therapeutics’ iPSC product platform is supported by an intellectual property portfolio of over 200 issued patents and 150 pending patent applications. About FT500 FT500 is an investigational, universal, off-the-shelf natural killer (NK) cell cancer immunotherapy derived from a clonal master induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) line. Despite the clinical benefit conferred by approved immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy against a variety of tumor types, these therapies are not curative and, in most cases, patients either fail to respond or progress on these agents. One common mechanism of resistance to ICI therapy is associated with loss-of-function mutations in genes critical for antigen presentation. A potential strategy to overcome resistance is through the administration of allogeneic NK cells, which have the inherent capability to recognize and directly kill tumor cells with these mutations. FT500 is being investigated in an open-label, multi-dose Phase 1 clinical trial for the treatment of advanced solid tumors (clinicaltrials.gov ID number NCT03841110). The study is designed to assess the safety and activity of three once-weekly doses of FT500 as a monotherapy and in combination with one of three FDA-approved ICI therapies – nivolumab, pembrolizumab or atezolizumab – in patients that have failed prior checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Patients who are clinically stable following the first cycle of FT500 treatment are eligible to receive a second treatment cycle of three additional once-weekly doses of FT500. About FT516 FT516 is an investigational, universal, off-the-shelf natural killer (NK) cell cancer immunotherapy derived from a clonal master induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) line engineered to express a novel high-affinity (158V), non-cleavable CD16 (hnCD16) Fc receptor. CD16 mediates antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), a potent anti-tumor mechanism by which NK cells recognize, bind and kill antibody-coated cancer cells. CD16 occurs in two variants, either with high (158V) or low (158F) affinity for the Fc domain of IgG1 antibodies. Numerous clinical studies with FDA-approved tumor-targeting antibodies, including rituximab, trastuzumab and cetuximab, have demonstrated that patients homozygous for the CD16 high-affinity variant , which is present in approximately 15% of patients , have improved clinical outcomes. In addition, ADCC is dependent on NK cells maintaining active levels of CD16 expression, and the expression of CD16 on NK cells has been shown to undergo considerable down-regulation in cancer patients, which can significantly inhibit anti-tumor activity . FT516 incorporates a novel CD16 Fc receptor, which has been modified to prevent its down-regulation and augment its binding to tumor-targeting antibodies for enhanced ADCC. The FDA has allowed investigation of FT516 in an open-label, multi-dose Phase 1 clinical trial as a monotherapy for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia and in combination with CD20-directed monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of B-cell lymphoma (clinicaltrials.gov ID number NCT04023071 ). About Fate Therapeutics, Inc. Fate Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of first-in-class cellular immunotherapies for cancer and immune disorders. The Company has established a leadership position in the clinical development and manufacture of universal, off-the-shelf cell products using its proprietary induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) product platform. The Company’s immuno-oncology product candidates include natural killer (NK) cell and T-cell cancer immunotherapies, which are designed to synergize with well-established cancer therapies, including immune checkpoint inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies, and to target tumor-associated antigens with chimeric antigen receptors (CARs).

(NASDAQ: FATE), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of programmed cellular immunotherapies for cancer and immune disorders, today reported business highlights and financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2019. “The early safety and tolerability signals observed in patients receiving multiple doses of FT500, the first iPSC-derived cell therapy to undergo clinical investigation in the United States, are very encouraging. The ability to cost-effectively mass-produce a universal cell-based cancer immunotherapy, and to safely deliver that therapy ‘on demand’ in multiple doses, has the potential to transform outcomes for many patients,” said Scott Wolchko, President and Chief Executive Officer of Fate Therapeutics. “We continue to be very pleased with the Company’s rapid pace of innovation, product development and leadership in bringing iPSC-derived cell-based immunotherapies engineered with potent anti-tumor functionality to cancer patients. Our first engineered iPSC-derived NK cell product candidate, FT516, is ready for Phase 1 clinical evaluation following successful completion of cGMP production, and the IND application for our multi-antigen targeted CAR19 NK cell product candidate, FT596, has been submitted to the FDA. Additionally, with the renewal of our collaboration with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center for the development of iPSC-derived T-cell immunotherapies, we are well positioned to continue to lead the field in the development of off-the-shelf CAR T-cell therapy.” Universal, Off-the-Shelf NK Cell Cancer Immunotherapy Clinical Programs • No DLTs Reported at 300M Cell Dose Level in FT500 Monotherapy Arm. The first three patients with advanced solid tumors have been treated with multiple doses of FT500, the Company’s universal, off-the-shelf natural killer (NK) cell product candidate derived from a clonal master induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) line, at the second dose level in the study’s monotherapy arm. All three patients received three weekly doses of FT500 at 300 million cells per dose in an outpatient setting, which treatment cycle was well-tolerated with no dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and no FT500-related serious adverse events reported by investigators . All three subjects were eligible to receive a second, multi-dose treatment cycle of FT500 at 300 million cells per dose. • No DLTs Reported at 100M Cell Dose Level in FT500 ICI Combination Arm. The first three patients with advanced solid tumors have been treated with multiple doses of FT500 in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) in the study’s combination arm. All three patients received three weekly doses of FT500 at 100 million cells per dose in an outpatient setting, which treatment cycle was well-tolerated with no dose-limiting toxicities and no FT500-related serious adverse events reported by investigators. All three subjects were eligible to receive a second, multi-dose treatment cycle of FT500 at 100 million cells per dose in combination with ICI. • FT516 cGMP Production Completed and Product Released for Clinical Trial Initiation. The Company completed final product release testing for FT516, a universal, off-the-shelf NK cell product candidate derived from a clonal master iPSC line engineered to express a novel high-affinity, non-cleavable CD16 (hnCD16) Fc receptor. Starting with a single cryopreserved vial from a master engineered iPSC bank, hundreds of cryopreserved doses of FT516 were produced in a single cGMP campaign at a low cost per dose. The cryopreserved FT516 cell product met stringent post-thaw release specifications, including identity, purity, viability and functional activity. The Company is currently initiating clinical investigation of FT516 as a monotherapy for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia and in combination with CD20-directed monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of B-cell lymphoma. FT516 is the first-ever cell product in the world derived from a genetically engineered pluripotent stem cell to be cleared for clinical investigation. Universal, Off-the-Shelf NK Cell and T-cell Cancer Immunotherapy Preclinical Pipeline • Submitted IND for FT596 Multi-Antigen Targeted CAR NK Cell. FT596 is the Company’s first universal, off-the-shelf chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) NK cell product candidate, and is uniquely designed to engage multiple tumor-associated antigens expressed on cancer cells for best-in-class activity. The product candidate is derived from a master iPSC line engineered to express three functional anti-tumor components: a proprietary CAR targeting the B-cell antigen CD19; a novel hnCD16 Fc receptor for augmented antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity; and a unique IL-15 receptor fusion for enhanced NK cell activity. The Company submitted its Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for clinical investigation of FT596 as a monotherapy and in combination with monoclonal antibody therapy for the treatment of subjects with advanced B-cell lymphomas and advanced chronic lymphocytic leukemia. • Renewed iPSC-derived T-cell Collaboration with MSK. Under its collaboration with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) led by Michel Sadelain, M.D., Ph.D., Director of the Center for Cell Engineering and the Stephen and Barbara Friedman Chair, the Company is currently conducting IND-enabling activities for FT819, its first universal, off-the-shelf CAR T-cell product candidate. FT819 is derived from a clonal master engineered iPSC line having complete elimination of T-cell receptor (TCR) expression and insertion of a novel 1XX CAR targeting CD19 into the T-cell receptor alpha (TRAC) locus. The three-year renewal extends the Company’s exclusive collaboration with Dr. Sadelain for the research and development of iPSC-derived T-cell product candidates. Corporate Highlights • Received New U.S. Patent for CAR-encoded iPSCs. In May 2019, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office granted to the Company a patent foundational to off-the-shelf, iPSC-derived CAR T-cell therapy. U.S. Patent Number 10,287,606, entitled “Genomic Engineering of Pluripotent Cells,” covers iPSCs having a CAR construct encoded into the TRAC locus and an endogenous TCR alpha gene knocked out. The complete elimination of the endogenous TCR gene is critical in allogeneic CAR T-cell therapy to ensure the prevention of graft-versus-host disease, a life-threatening disease that can occur when donor T-cells attack a patient’s healthy tissue. • Expanded Board of Directors. In July 2019, the Company appointed Dr. Shefali Agarwal to its Board of Directors. Dr. Agarwal has nearly two decades of leadership experience across clinical development, medical research, clinical operations, regulatory, and medical affairs in oncology, and is currently the Chief Medical Officer of Epizyme, Inc., a clinical-stage company developing novel epigenetic therapies for cancer and other serious diseases.

About Fate Therapeutics’ iPSC Product Platform The Company’s proprietary induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) product platform enables mass production of off-the-shelf, engineered, homogeneous cell products that can be administered in repeat doses to mediate more effective pharmacologic activity, including in combination with cycles of other cancer treatments. Human iPSCs possess the unique dual properties of unlimited self-renewal and differentiation potential into all cell types of the body. The Company’s first-of-kind approach involves engineering human iPSCs in a one-time genetic modification event and selecting a single iPSC for maintenance as a clonal master iPSC line. Analogous to master cell lines used to manufacture biopharmaceutical drug products such as monoclonal antibodies, clonal master iPSC lines are a renewable source for manufacturing cell therapy products which are well-defined and uniform in composition, can be mass produced at significant scale in a cost-effective manner, and can be delivered off-the-shelf for patient treatment. As a result, the Company’s platform is uniquely capable of overcoming numerous limitations associated with the production of cell therapies using patient- or donor-sourced cells, which is logistically complex and expensive and is fraught with batch-to-batch and cell-to-cell variability that can affect safety and efficacy. Fate Therapeutics’ iPSC product platform is supported by an intellectual property portfolio of over 200 issued patents and 150 pending patent applications. About FT500 FT500 is an investigational, universal, off-the-shelf natural killer (NK) cell cancer immunotherapy derived from a clonal master induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) line. Despite the clinical benefit conferred by approved immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy against a variety of tumor types, these therapies are not curative and, in most cases, patients either fail to respond or progress on these agents. One common mechanism of resistance to ICI therapy is associated with loss-of-function mutations in genes critical for antigen presentation. A potential strategy to overcome resistance is through the administration of allogeneic NK cells, which have the inherent capability to recognize and directly kill tumor cells with these mutations. FT500 is being investigated in an open-label, multi-dose Phase 1 clinical trial for the treatment of advanced solid tumors (clinicaltrials.gov ID number NCT03841110). The study is designed to assess the safety and activity of three once-weekly doses of FT500 as a monotherapy and in combination with one of three FDA-approved ICI therapies – nivolumab, pembrolizumab or atezolizumab – in patients that have failed prior checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Patients who are clinically stable following the first cycle of FT500 treatment are eligible to receive a second treatment cycle of three additional once-weekly doses of FT500. About FT516 FT516 is an investigational, universal, off-the-shelf natural killer (NK) cell cancer immunotherapy derived from a clonal master induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) line engineered to express a novel high-affinity (158V), non-cleavable CD16 (hnCD16) Fc receptor. CD16 mediates antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), a potent anti-tumor mechanism by which NK cells recognize, bind and kill antibody-coated cancer cells. CD16 occurs in two variants, either with high (158V) or low (158F) affinity for the Fc domain of IgG1 antibodies. Numerous clinical studies with FDA-approved tumor-targeting antibodies, including rituximab, trastuzumab and cetuximab, have demonstrated that patients homozygous for the CD16 high-affinity variant , which is present in approximately 15% of patients , have improved clinical outcomes. In addition, ADCC is dependent on NK cells maintaining active levels of CD16 expression, and the expression of CD16 on NK cells has been shown to undergo considerable down-regulation in cancer patients, which can significantly inhibit anti-tumor activity . FT516 incorporates a novel CD16 Fc receptor, which has been modified to prevent its down-regulation and augment its binding to tumor-targeting antibodies for enhanced ADCC. The FDA has allowed investigation of FT516 in an open-label, multi-dose Phase 1 clinical trial as a monotherapy for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia and in combination with CD20-directed monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of B-cell lymphoma (clinicaltrials.gov ID number NCT04023071 ). About Fate Therapeutics, Inc. Fate Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of first-in-class cellular immunotherapies for cancer and immune disorders. The Company has established a leadership position in the clinical development and manufacture of universal, off-the-shelf cell products using its proprietary induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) product platform. The Company’s immuno-oncology product candidates include natural killer (NK) cell and T-cell cancer immunotherapies, which are designed to synergize with well-established cancer therapies, including immune checkpoint inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies, and to target tumor-associated antigens with chimeric antigen receptors (CARs).

Scott Wolchko President and Chief Executive Officer -;-EX-99.1:Exhibit 99.1 Fate Therapeutics Announces the Appointment of Dr. Shefali Agarwal to its Board of Directors San Diego, CA – July 17, 2019 – Fate Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: FATE), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of programmed cellular immunotherapies for cancer and immune disorders, today announced that Dr. Shefali Agarwal has been appointed to the Company’s Board of Directors. Dr. Agarwal is currently the Chief Medical Officer of Epizyme, Inc., a clinical-stage company developing novel epigenetic therapies for cancer and other serious diseases, where she leads the global clinical development and regulatory strategy for tazemetostat for the treatment of cancer. She brings to the Company nearly two decades of clinical development and regulatory experience in oncology. “Shefali is an accomplished leader with proven expertise in the late-stage development of innovative cancer therapies for the treatment of hematologic malignancies and solid tumors, and we are pleased to welcome her to our Board,” said Scott Wolchko, President and Chief Executive Officer of Fate Therapeutics. “We look forward to benefiting from Shefali’s breadth of clinical and regulatory experience at this exciting time for the Company as we advance our deep pipeline of iPSC-derived NK cell and T-cell product candidates for the treatment of cancer.” “I have watched with excitement as Fate Therapeutics successfully translated its unrivaled expertise in iPSC technology and became the first company to clinically make and use clonal master iPSC lines for the mass production of off-the-shelf cell products,” said Dr. Agarwal. “I look forward to working closely with the Board and executive management team as the Company continues to lead in bringing cell-based cancer immunotherapies that can be delivered “on demand” and administered in multiple doses to cancer patients as a means of driving deep durable responses.” Over the span of her career as a trained physician with expertise in medical oncology, Dr. Agarwal has held leadership positions across clinical development, medical research, clinical operations, regulatory, and medical affairs. Prior to joining Epizyme as Chief Medical Officer in July 2018, Dr. Agarwal served as Chief Medical Officer at SQZ Biotech, where she built and led the clinical development organization, which included clinical research operations and regulatory functions.

About Fate Therapeutics’ iPSC Product Platform The Company’s proprietary induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) product platform enables mass production of off-the-shelf, engineered, homogeneous cell products that can be administered in repeat doses to mediate more effective pharmacologic activity, including in combination with cycles of other cancer treatments. Human iPSCs possess the unique dual properties of unlimited self-renewal and differentiation potential into all cell types of the body. The Company’s first-of-kind approach involves engineering human iPSCs in a one-time genetic modification event and selecting a single iPSC for maintenance as a clonal master iPSC line. Analogous to master cell lines used to manufacture biopharmaceutical drug products such as monoclonal antibodies, clonal master iPSC lines are a renewable source for manufacturing cell therapy products which are well-defined and uniform in composition, can be mass produced at significant scale in a cost-effective manner, and can be delivered off-the-shelf to treat many patients. As a result, the Company’s platform is uniquely capable of overcoming numerous limitations associated with the production of cell therapies using patient- or donor-sourced cells, which is logistically complex and expensive and is fraught with batch-to-batch and cell-to-cell variability that can affect safety and efficacy. Fate Therapeutics’ iPSC product platform is supported by an intellectual property portfolio of over 100 issued patents and 100 pending patent applications. About Fate Therapeutics, Inc. Fate Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of first-in-class cellular immunotherapies for cancer and immune disorders. The Company is pioneering the development of universal, off-the-shelf cell products using its proprietary induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) product platform. The Company’s immuno-oncology pipeline is comprised of NK cell and T-cell cancer immunotherapies, with a focus on developing universal, off-the-shelf cell products intended to synergize with checkpoint inhibitor and monoclonal antibody therapies and to target tumor-associated antigens. The Company’s first iPSC-derived NK cell product candidates include FT500, which is currently being clinically investigated for the treatment of advanced solid tumors, and FT516, for which the Company is preparing to initiate clinical investigation for the treatment of certain hematologic malignancies. The Company’s immuno-regulatory pipeline includes ProTmune™, a pharmacologically modulated donor cell graft that is currently being evaluated in a Phase 2 clinical trial for the prevention of graft-versus-host disease, and a myeloid-derived suppressor cell immunotherapy for promoting immune tolerance in patients with immune disorders. Fate Therapeutics is headquartered in San Diego, CA. For more information, please visit www.fatetherapeutics.com.
